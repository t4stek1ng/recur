Step one: the total weight. Three bags times 10 ounces per bag equals 30 ounces. Makes perfect sense. Step two: the total M&M count. With 30 ounces and 30 M&Ms per ounce, I multiply them to get 900 M&Ms. Good, all checks out. Lastly, step three: the number of small bags.

I know that there are 9 kids, each needing 2 s'mores, and 6 adults, each wanting 1. So, kids: 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. Adults: 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. That gives us 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores needed *overall*.\n\nNext, I need to relate s'mores to graham cracker sleeves. We're told a sleeve makes 8 s'mores. To make 24 s'mores, that's 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves of graham crackers.\n\nFinally, I bridge the gap from sleeves to boxes. There are 3 sleeves in a box. Since I need 3 sleeves, I require 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box of graham crackers.\n\nI have to verify my answer is sound.

First, I need to make sure I'm answering the right question \u2013 they want to know *how much is left*, not how much was pumped. That's critical. So I'll need to figure out the total amount pumped and then subtract that from the tank's capacity. Simple enough.\n\nOkay, let's grab the key information. Tank capacity is 18000 gallons. We have two days of pumping, with Wanda and Ms. B. Day 1 is straightforward: Wanda pumps 1/4, and Ms. B pumps 3/4 *as much* as Wanda. Day 2 gets a little trickier: Wanda pumps 2/3 *of the amount* she pumped on Day 1, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 *of the number of gallons* she pumped on Day 1. It is important to keep track of this wording.\n\nNow, let's calculate day by day.\n\n*   **Day 1 - Wanda:** 1/4 * 18000. 18000 / 4 is 4500 gallons. I'll store that as `Wanda_D1`.\n\n*   **Day 1 - Ms. B:** 3/4 * `Wanda_D1`. That's 3/4 * 4500. So, (3 * 4500) / 4 = 3375 gallons. Store as `MsB_D1`.\n\n*   **Day 2 - Wanda:** 2/3 * `Wanda_D1`. That's 2/3 * 4500, or (2 * 4500) / 3 = 3000 gallons. Store this as `Wanda_D2`.\n\n*   **Day 2 - Ms. B:** 1/3 * `MsB_D1`. That's 1/3 * 3375, or 3375 / 3 = 1125 gallons. Store this as `MsB_D2`.\n\nNow, to get the total amount pumped.\n\n*   `Total = Wanda_D1 + MsB_D1 + Wanda_D2 + MsB_D2` which is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125. Let's do this step-by-step to be safe. So, 4500 + 3375 is 7875 and 3000 + 1125 is 4125. 7875 + 4125 is 12000 gallons. So `Total_Pumped` = 12000.\n\nFinally, to calculate how much is *remaining*.\n\n*   `Remaining = Tank Capacity - Total_Pumped`. That's 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nBefore I say I'm done, I need to double-check. Does 6000 gallons make sense? Yep, it's less than the full capacity, so it seems correct.

First, I need to be absolutely sure I understand the question. It's asking for the *specific* number of castles that are both ruined *and* unmanned. It's a classic intersection problem.\n\nNow, let's dissect the data. We're given: a total of 220 castles, 40% are ruins, and *within* the ruined castles, half are unmanned. Right, so I need to find the number of ruined castles, and then apply the \"half are unmanned\" factor to *that* result.\n\nSo, Step 1: Let's calculate the number of ruined castles. I'll take 40% of the total, 220. I'll convert the percentage to a decimal, that's 0.40. Then multiply 0.40 by 220. Mentally, I think, 0.4 * 220 is the same as 4 * 22, just shifting the decimal places. That makes it easier.  4 * 22 is 88. So, 88 ruined castles.\n\nStep 2: Now the unmanned part. We know half of those 88 ruined castles are unmanned. \"Half\" means divide by 2. So, 88 divided by 2 is 44. Therefore, 44 unmanned ruined castles.\n\nFinal check. Does it logically follow? Yes. 44 is a smaller number than 88 which is the number of ruined castles. 44 is also a smaller number than 220, the total. I've also made sure I answered the *specific* question that was asked, by finding the number of unmanned ruined castles. That's a solid result.

That's the target.\n\n2.  **Strategic Breakdown and Interpretation:** The phrasing \"start with\" strongly suggests a backward-working strategy, as that\u2019s usually simpler in this type of problem. Let's break down each day, explicitly noting usage and order quantities. The key is to analyze the data chronologically in reverse and consider possible interpretations of how \"ordered\" bandages affect the daily count.\n\n    *   **Day 3:** We know the ending count (78), plus the bulk order and usage amounts.\n\n    *   **Day 2:** The usage is dependent on the Day 1 count, but we are working backwards, so this is fine.\n\n    *   **Day 1:** Usage and a single bulk order. The key here is to interpret the timing of the orders - does it arrive before, after, or in the middle of each day's usage? It is not clear in this problem, which is a common point of potential ambiguity in this style of problem, so I will analyze with a few approaches.\n\n3.  **Backward Calculation Strategy:**\n\n    *   **End of Day 3 is Our Anchor:** Begin with the 78 bandages at the end of Day 3.\n\n    *   **Day 3 Details (Backward):** Before usage (78 + 25 = 103), and before the order (103 - 100 = 3). Day 3 began with 3 bandages.\n\n    *   **Day 2 (Backward):** Day 2 ended with 3 bandages, so it started the day with that amount. The usage was 38-10 = 28. (3 + 28 = 31), so start of Day 2 had 31.\n\n    *   **Day 1 (Backward):** Day 1 ended with 31. The usage was 38. This implies we have to work with this fact as well, since this will affect the day total. Before Day 1 use and the bulk order, there were 31 + 38 = 69 bandages, so there were 69 - 50 = 19 to start Day 1.\n\n4.  **Forward Check and Critical Interpretation:** Now, *the important part*. Let's perform a forward check, and also consider how \"ordering\" works relative to daily usage.\n\n    *   **Initial Setup:** We can start with the value derived, 19. If there were 19, then the process can be described with a series of equations in terms of x.\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   Day 1: Start 19. Used 38: 19 - 38 = -19 (We dipped into the new pack on Day 1). Order 50; so -19 + 50 = 31 end of day 1.\n        *   Day 2: Start 31, Usage 38 - 10 = 28; 31 - 28 = 3 (end day 2).\n        *   Day 3: Start 3, Order (2 * 50 = 100 bandages); Usage (0.5 * 50 = 25 bandages); 3 + 100 - 25 = 78 end of day 3.\n        *   Works.\n\n    *   This confirms the answer (19). However, note that we had to make a small *interpretation* about the timing of the ordered bandages. \"Ordered\" *probably* means \"received and available for use\" on the same day. The check confirms that. If it's *not* the case, the math would have been incorrect. Let's re-state this to be sure:\n\n    *   Using an unknown, x, we can work from the end. If x - 38 + 50 - (38 - 10) - (2*50) + 25 = 78, it checks out.\n    *   Then, given the information, we get 19 as the start of Day 1's value.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Now, here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the *rate* at which they're raising money. The problem conveniently assumes a constant rate per hour. Therefore, the rate is simply the amount raised divided by the time it took.

If they're raising $700 per hour, in 9 hours, they'd raise $700 * 9 = $6300, which aligns precisely with the goal.

That gives me $4 for all the strawberry gum.\n\nSince there are two packs of strawberry gum, the final step is a division: $4 / 2 = $2 per pack.\n\nTo confirm the answer, I'm performing a quick sanity check:  $2 per strawberry pack, $2 grape pack, $1 green apple pack. That totals $7, and the pack counts match the original problem. Confirmed.\n", "output": "Let's break down Suzie's gum purchases:\n\n1.  **Grape gum:** She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.\n2.  **Green apple gum:** She paid half as much for green apple gum as she did for grape gum.

First, I need to pinpoint the ultimate objective: to determine the *final cost* of Charlotte's purchase after the discount is applied. That's the crux of the issue.\n\nNext, I'll need to deconstruct the initial purchase to figure out the pre-discount cost. It's essentially a component analysis, which means:\n\n*   The pots and pans cost $120.00.\n*   The mixing bowls are $20.00.\n*   The utensils require a little math since it is 5 utensils, each costing $5.00, meaning 5 \\* $5.00 = $25.00\n\nWith those components identified, I can determine the total cost before the discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.\n\nNow, to deal with the discount, I know everything's 20% off. I'll take that information, and figure out the amount of that discount: 20% of the pre-discount total. That involves a simple percentage calculation. 20% translates to a decimal of 0.20, and 0.20 multiplied by $165.00 equals $33.00. So, the discount itself is $33.00.\n\nTo arrive at the final cost, I simply subtract the discount from the original price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.\n\nAn alternative, equally valid method for determining this is to realize that a 20% discount means Charlotte is paying 80% of the original cost. That is, 100% (full price) - 20% (discount) = 80%. I'll then convert 80% into the decimal 0.80 and multiply that by the original price of $165.00 to give me $132.00.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is $132.00.\n", "output": "Let's break down Charlotte's order:\n\n1.  **Cost of items before discount:**\n    *   Pot and pans: $120.00\n    *   Mixing bowls: $20.00\n    *   5 utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00\n    *   **Total before discount:** $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00\n\n2.  **Calculate the discount:**\n    *   Discount is 20% off the total: 20% of $165.00\n    *   0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00\n\n3.  **Calculate the final order amount:**\n    *   Total before discount - Discount amount\n    *   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00\n\nCharlotte's order was **$132.00**."}

Week 2 is half of Week 1, which immediately gives me 4,000 bars. Week 3 is triple Week 1, landing at 24,000 bars. Then, I summed the production of Weeks 1 through 3.

With Shelley's count in hand, the relationship between Shelley and Kim would then unlock Kim's number. It's a fairly straightforward substitution problem, really.\n\nI started by using the fact that Samantha has 27 paintings and 12 fewer than Shelley.  Therefore, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings. This gave me Shelley's number.\n\nMoving on to the final step, Shelley has 39 paintings and 8 more than Kim.

I see that he's already removed some weight in the form of 30 comic books. So, I need to calculate exactly how much that contributes to the 15-pound target. Each comic weighs a quarter of a pound. This is straightforward: 30 comic books times 1/4 pound per comic equals 7.5 pounds removed so far.\n\nNext, I'll figure out the remaining weight that still needs to be removed.

Irrelevant data like the date and the restaurant name can be disregarded. I'm focusing on the core facts: the number of adults (42) dictates the requirement for regular chairs, and the number of babies (15) establishes the need for high chairs. Crucially, I have to take note of the relationship between the regular and high chairs in the restaurant itself: the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and importantly, that there are 8 high chairs currently available.\n\nNext, I'll organize my calculations. For chair needs, 42 regular chairs are needed and 15 high chairs are needed. For availability, I know there are 8 high chairs. From the statement \"5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs\", I can derive that the number of regular chairs is 5 multiplied by the number of high chairs (5 * 8 = 40). Thus, the restaurant has 40 regular chairs available. That gives me a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs currently.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll compare the needs and availability. I'll break it down by chair type.
