{"id": 0, "temperature": 0, "output": 673, "content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many small bags John can make with his M&Ms. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, John buys 3 large bags of M&Ms. Each of these large bags weighs 10 ounces. So, I should calculate the total weight of M&Ms he has. That would be 3 bags multiplied by 10 ounces each. Let me write that out: 3 * 10 ounces. Hmm, 3 times 10 is 30. So, John has a total of 30 ounces of M&Ms.\n\nNext, I know that each ounce of M&Ms contains 30 pieces. So, to find out how many M&Ms John has in total, I need to multiply the total ounces by the number of M&Ms per ounce. That would be 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms per ounce. Let me do that multiplication: 30 * 30. I think that's 900. So, John has 900 M&Ms in total.\n\nNow, John wants to put these M&Ms into small bags, with each small bag containing 10 M&Ms. To find out how many small bags he can make, I need to divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag. That would be 900 M&Ms divided by 10 M&Ms per bag. So, 900 / 10 equals 90. Therefore, John can make 90 small bags.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 bags * 10 ounces each is indeed 30 ounces. Then, 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms per ounce is 900 M&Ms. Dividing 900 by 10 gives 90 bags. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The problem was straightforward once I broke it down into smaller steps. First, total weight, then total number of M&Ms, and finally, how many small bags that makes. Everything adds up, so I'm confident the answer is 90 small bags.\n</think>\n\nJohn can make 90 small bags of M&Ms. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Weight of M&Ms:**\n   - John buys 3 large bags.\n   - Each bag weighs 10 ounces.\n   - Total weight = 3 * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.\n\n2. **Determine Total Number of M&Ms:**\n   - Each ounce contains 30 M&Ms.\n   - Total M&Ms = 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms/ounce = 900 M&Ms.\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Small Bags:**\n   - Each small bag holds 10 M&Ms.\n   - Number of small bags = 900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms per bag = 90 bags.\n\n**Answer:** John can make 90 small bags of M&Ms."}
{"id": 1, "temperature": 0, "output": 691, "content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed for the smores. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. That means one sleeve can make 8 smores. Now, there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, if one sleeve makes 8 smores, then three sleeves would make 8 times 3, which is 24 smores per box. Got that down.\n\nNext, there are 9 kids who each want 2 smores. So, I should calculate how many smores the kids will eat in total. That would be 9 kids multiplied by 2 smores each. Let me do that: 9 times 2 is 18. So, the kids will eat 18 smores altogether.\n\nThen, there are 6 adults, and each adult will eat 1 smore. So, the adults will eat 6 smores in total. That's straightforward: 6 times 1 is 6.\n\nNow, I need to add up the smores eaten by both kids and adults. The kids eat 18, and the adults eat 6, so together that's 18 plus 6, which equals 24 smores in total.\n\nSince each box makes 24 smores, and they need exactly 24 smores, they would need 24 divided by 24, which is 1 box. So, they only need 1 box of graham crackers to have enough for everyone.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each sleeve is 8 smores, 3 sleeves make 24 per box. 9 kids times 2 is 18, 6 adults times 1 is 6, total 24. Yep, that's exactly one box. So, no extra boxes needed. That seems right.\n</think>\n\nThey will need 1 box of graham crackers. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate Smores per Box:**\n   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.\n   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.\n   - Total smores per box = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 smores.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Smores Needed for Kids:**\n   - Number of kids = 9.\n   - Smores per kid = 2.\n   - Total smores for kids = 9 \u00d7 2 = 18 smores.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Smores Needed for Adults:**\n   - Number of adults = 6.\n   - Smores per adult = 1.\n   - Total smores for adults = 6 \u00d7 1 = 6 smores.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Smores Needed:**\n   - Total smores = smores for kids + smores for adults = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.\n\n5. **Determine Number of Boxes Needed:**\n   - Each box makes 24 smores.\n   - Total boxes needed = Total smores \u00f7 Smores per box = 24 \u00f7 24 = 1 box.\n\n**Answer:** They will need 1 box of graham crackers."}
{"id": 2, "temperature": 0, "output": 840, "content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much water is left in the tank after Wanda and Ms. B worked for two days. The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons. Let me break down what each of them did on each day.\n\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. Since the tank is 18,000 gallons, I can calculate how much that is. So, 1/4 of 18,000 is 4,500 gallons. That makes sense because 18,000 divided by 4 is 4,500.\n\nThen, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda did that day. Wanda did 4,500 gallons, so 3/4 of that would be 3/4 * 4,500. Let me do that math: 4,500 divided by 4 is 1,125, and 1,125 multiplied by 3 is 3,375 gallons. So, Ms. B pumped 3,375 gallons on the first day.\n\nTogether, on the first day, they pumped 4,500 + 3,375 gallons. Adding those together gives 7,875 gallons. So, after day one, the tank has 7,875 gallons in it.\n\nMoving on to the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she did on the first day. She did 4,500 gallons before, so 2/3 of that is 2/3 * 4,500. Let me calculate that: 4,500 divided by 3 is 1,500, and 1,500 multiplied by 2 is 3,000 gallons. So, Wanda pumped 3,000 gallons on the second day.\n\nMs. B, on the other hand, pumped 1/3 of what she did on the first day. She did 3,375 gallons before, so 1/3 of that is 3,375 / 3, which is 1,125 gallons. So, Ms. B pumped 1,125 gallons on the second day.\n\nAdding their contributions for the second day: 3,000 + 1,125 equals 4,125 gallons. So, on the second day, they pumped 4,125 gallons together.\n\nNow, let's add up both days. The first day was 7,875 gallons, and the second day was 4,125 gallons. Adding those together: 7,875 + 4,125 equals 12,000 gallons. So, in total, they've pumped 12,000 gallons into the tank over two days.\n\nThe tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so to find out how much is left, I subtract the total pumped from the capacity. That's 18,000 - 12,000, which equals 6,000 gallons remaining.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst day: Wanda did 4,500, Ms. B did 3,375. Total 7,875. Second day: Wanda did 3,000, Ms. B did 1,125. Total 4,125. Combined total is 12,000. Subtracting from 18,000 gives 6,000. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is **6,000 gallons**."}
{"id": 3, "temperature": 0, "output": 266, "content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many unmanned ruined castles there are in Scotland based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that there are 220 castles in total. Out of these, 40% are ruins. To find out how many that is, I can calculate 40% of 220. \n\nSo, 40% is the same as 0.4 in decimal form. Multiplying 220 by 0.4 gives me the number of ruined castles. Let me do that: 220 * 0.4 = 88. So, there are 88 ruined castles.\n\nNext, the problem says that half of these ruined castles are unmanned. That means I need to find half of 88. Half is the same as dividing by 2, so 88 / 2 = 44. \n\nTherefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.\n\nI think that's all the steps needed. I don't see any complications or additional factors here, so I'm confident that 44 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThere are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland. \n\nTrue."}
{"id": 4, "temperature": 0, "output": 430, "content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's outline what happened each day:\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   - They used 38 bandages.\n   - They ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.\n   - So, the number of bandages they had at the end of the first day would be the starting number minus 38 used, plus 50 ordered. That would be B - 38 + 50, which simplifies to B + 12.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   - They used ten fewer bandages than the first day. Since they used 38 on the first day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.\n   - So, subtracting that from the previous day's total: B + 12 - 28 = B - 16.\n\n3. **Third Day:**\n   - They ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.\n   - They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.\n   - So, adding the 100 ordered and subtracting the 25 used: B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59.\n\n4. **End of Third Day:**\n   - They had 78 bandages left. So, B + 59 = 78.\n\nNow, solving for B:\nB + 59 = 78\nSubtract 59 from both sides:\nB = 78 - 59\nB = 19\n\nSo, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.\n</think>\n\nThe nurses' station started with 19 bandages on the first day.\n\n**Answer:** They started with 19 bandages."}
