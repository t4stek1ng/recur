Because if a car spends half of its total time T at 60\u202fmph and half at 30\u202fmph, then:\n\n \u2022  Distance covered at 60\u202fmph = 60\u202f\u00d7\u202f(T/2) = 30T.  \n \u2022  Distance covered at 30\u202fmph = 30\u202f\u00d7\u202f(T/2) = 15T.  \n \u2022  Total distance = 30T + 15T = 45T.  \n\nSetting that total to 480\u202fmiles gives  \n45T = 480  \u21d2  T \u2248 10.67\u202fhours,  \nwhich rounds to nearly 11\u202fhours.  \n\nBut that is a completely different problem from \u201cconstant 30\u202fmph over 480\u202fmiles.\u201d  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBottom line\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022  If the question truly says \u201cthe slower car drives at half the 60\u202fmph speed (i.e. 30\u202fmph) for the entire 480\u202fmiles,\u201d then the correct travel time is 16\u202fhours, not 11.  \n\u2022  An \u201c11\u202fhours\u201d result typically arises from a different scenario (such as half\u2010the\u2010time at one speed and half\u2010the\u2010time at another).  \n\nSo the short answer is simply that 16\u202fhours is correct given the usual distance\u2010speed\u2010time formula; \u201c11\u202fhours\u201d must come from either a misprint or from mixing in a different average\u2010speed scenario."}

But in the \u201cS=19\u201d scenario, you end Day\u00a02 with 3 leftover bandages.  On Day\u00a03 you need 25 total, so in real life you would use up those 3 left over from Day\u00a02 and then open a new pack for the remaining 22.  That means you did not truly use \u201chalf a (new) pack\u201d on Day\u00a03; you only used 22 out of the new pack (because 3 came from leftovers).\n\nIn other words, the simple arithmetic of \u201c19\u201d treats the leftover 3 bandages at the end of Day\u00a02 as if they just sat on the shelf and were never touched on Day\u00a03\u2014even though Day\u00a03 needed 25 bandages!  That contradicts the puzzle\u2019s plain\u2010English statement that Day\u00a03\u2019s usage \u201cwas half a pack.\u201d \n\nThus, 19 is the \u201cbookkeeping\u201d answer if you pretend old leftovers are never used, but it does not match the real\u2010life (FIFO) reading of \u201conly half a pack was used\u201d on Day\u00a03.

That reasoning sounds straightforward\u2014but it is actually based on the wrong interpretation of the puzzle.\n\nWhy?  Because the phrase \u201cthere are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode\u201d is typically the puzzle\u2019s way of telling you that the (unknown) number of episodes, E, is half of the (unknown) length of one episode, M.

If you read \u201c1/4 pound per dozen\u201d incorrectly, you might try 28 \u00f7 1/4 = 112 (thinking \u201cHow many 1/4\u2011pound chunks fit into 28 dozens?\u201d) which is not what the problem actually asks.

The arithmetic unambiguously shows that they need 1 box, not 0.  If some source or key lists \u201c0,\u201d it is almost certainly a misprint or an error.\n\nWhy the correct answer is 1 box:  \n1) Total s\u2019mores needed = (9 kids \u00d7 2 each) + (6 adults \u00d7 1 each) = 18 + 6 = 24  \n2) Each sleeve of graham crackers yields 8 s\u2019mores \u2192 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 sleeves needed  \n3) Each box contains 3 sleeves \u2192 3 sleeves \u00f7 3 sleeves/box = 1 box  \n\nSo they need exactly 1 box.  There is no way for the correct answer to be zero unless the problem had some hidden assumption (for example, \u201cthey already have one full box,\u201d so they must buy 0 more).  But given only the stated facts, you do need 1 new box of graham crackers to make 24 s\u2019mores."}
