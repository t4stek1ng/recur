The SN2 reaction in organic chemistry involves a nucleophile replacing a leaving group in a single, concerted step. One key feature of SN2 reactions is stereochemical inversion, where the spatial arrangement of substituents around the carbon atom undergoing substitution changes. This inversion occurs when the base extract proton and the nucleophile attack the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group, leading to a reversal in stereochemistry.
Considering the reaction, what are the reactants and products of the following reaction?
(R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) ---> B
Why the correct answer is A = TsOH, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine?<|im_end|>

Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the reaction given is between (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium and something labeled A, which is CH3CH2I. The product is B, and the correct answer is supposed to be A = TsOH and B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine. Wait, I need to figure out why TsOH is the reactant and what the mechanism is here.

First, let me parse the starting materials. The first compound is an ethanaminium ion, right? That's a protonated amine, like an ammonium salt. The name is (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium. The "idene" suggests it's a ketimine or imine. The substituents: the ethyl group is on the 2-position of the cyclohexyl ring, and the ethanamine part is connected via a double bond to the cyclohexane (since it's a ketimine). The configuration is R and Z, so the stereochemistry is specified.

The other reactant A is given as CH3CH2I, which is ethyl iodide. But the correct answer says A is TsOH. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe CH3CH2I is the other reactant, but the question says A is TsOH. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo here? Wait, looking again. The question says "reactants are (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) → B". Wait, maybe the reactants are the first compound plus A which is TsOH and CH3CH2I? Or maybe the reaction is between the first compound and A which is CH3CH2I, but the correct A is TsOH? That's confusing. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: "(R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) ---> B. Why the correct answer is A = TsOH, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine?"

Ah, so the reaction is between the N-acyliminium (the ethanaminium) and something A (which is TsOH) and CH3CH2I? Or is CH3CH2I part of A? Maybe the way it's written is that the reactants are the first compound plus "A, CH3CH2I", meaning A is TsOH and the other reactant is CH3CH2I? Because TsOH is a common catalyst, maybe acting as a proton source or something?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo and the reaction is between the starting material and A (TsOH) and CH3CH2I is part of another reactant? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an SN2 reaction where the leaving group is on the ammonium, and the nucleophile is ethoxide or something? Wait, but the leaving group would require a good leaving group. Wait, TsOH is p-toluenesulfonic acid, which is a strong acid. Maybe TsOH is acting as a catalyst here.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product is (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine. So the product is an amine where the cyclohexane ring has ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 6, and the nitrogen has an ethyl group. The starting material has a 2-ethylcyclohexylidene group attached to ethanaminium. Let me try to visualize this.

The starting material is a ketimine (since it's an imine with a double bond between nitrogen and the cyclohexylidene). The structure would be:

The ethanaminium part: the nitrogen is part of an ammonium ion (since it's protonated). Wait, the name is N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure would be:

The nitrogen is connected to two ethyl groups (since it's ethanamine, so CH2CH3, but wait, ethanamine is ethylamine, so maybe the ethanaminium is (CH2CH3)2NH2+? Or perhaps the ethanaminium is a different structure. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the ketimine structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a Schiff base that's been protonated. A ketimine would have a structure like:

R2N-C=CR2', where the nitrogen is connected via a double bond to the cyclohexylidene. But when protonated, the nitrogen would have a positive charge, making it an iminium ion. The structure would be such that the nitrogen has three groups (maybe two ethyl groups and the imine group, but let's see the name again).

The full name is (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium. Breaking this down:

- The ethanaminium part: the ethyl amine protonated. So ethanamine is CH2CH3-NH2. When protonated, it's CH2CH3-NH3+.

- The substituent is N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene). So the nitrogen is attached to a 2-ethylcyclohexylidene group. The "idene" suggests a double bond. So the cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexyl group with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's a ketimine, so the structure would be:

The nitrogen (from the ethanamine) is connected via a double bond to the cyclohexane ring that has an ethyl group on the 2-position. So the overall structure would be something like:

CH2CH3-N+-[C=CR2]... where the R groups are the cyclohexyl substituents. The (R,Z) configuration refers to the stereocenters in the starting material.

The reaction then proceeds with A (TsOH) and CH3CH2I? Wait, but TsOH is a possible catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps TsOH is acting as an acid to deprotonate something, or maybe it's a catalyst in an SN2 reaction?

Wait, the product has an amine where the cyclohexane ring now has ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 6, and the nitrogen has an ethyl group. The original starting material had a 2-ethyl group on the cyclohexane. The product has another ethyl on the 6-position, so maybe an addition?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a nucleophilic substitution. Since the question mentions SN2, that's a key hint. So maybe the leaving group is the cyclohexylidene part? Wait, but in an SN2 reaction, the leaving group is usually on a carbon attached to a good leaving group. Alternatively, the leaving group could be the proton in the ammonium?

Alternatively, the ketimine (the starting material's structure) can undergo a nucleophilic attack. Since it's an iminium ion (positive charge on nitrogen), maybe the cyclohexylidene is part of a leaving group. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction leading to formation of the amine.

Alternatively, if the leaving group is the double bond part, maybe the ethyl iodide is acting as a nucleophile? But ethyl iodide is a good leaving group as iodide, but as a reactant, perhaps it's acting as an alkylating agent. Wait, but the product has an ethyl attached to nitrogen. The original starting material has ethanamine's ethyl group. Wait, the product has N,2,6-triethyl, so three ethyl groups: on N, on C2, and C6. The original has N connected to ethyl (from ethanamine) and C2 has an ethyl. So the new ethyl would be on C6, so perhaps the ethyl iodide is the source?

Ah, the product has an amine where the cyclohexane ring now has ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 6, and the nitrogen has an ethyl group. The original starting material had a 2-ethyl group on the cyclohexane. The product has another ethyl on the 6-position, so maybe an addition?

Therefore, perhaps the reaction involves a nucleophilic substitution. Since the question mentions SN2, that's a key hint. So maybe the leaving group is the cyclohexylidene part? Wait, but in an SN2 reaction, the leaving group is usually on a carbon attached to a good leaving group. Alternatively, the leaving group could be the proton in the ammonium?

Wait, the ketimine (the starting material's structure) can undergo a nucleophilic attack. Since it's an iminium ion (positive charge on nitrogen), maybe the cyclohexylidene is part of a leaving group. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction leading to formation of the amine.

Now, if the leaving group is the double bond part, maybe the ethyl iodide is acting as a nucleophile? But ethyl iodide is a good leaving group as iodide, but as a reactant, perhaps it's acting as an alkylating agent. Wait, but the product has an ethyl attached to nitrogen. The original starting material has ethanamine's ethyl group. Wait, the product has N,2,6-triethyl, so three ethyl groups: on N, on C2, and C6. The original has N connected to ethyl (from ethanamine) and C2 has an ethyl. So the new ethyl would be on C6, so perhaps the ethyl iodide is the source?

Okay, the product has an amine where the cyclohexane ring now has ethyl groups on carbons 2 and 6, and the nitrogen has an ethyl group. The original starting material had a 2-ethyl group on the cyclohexane. The product has another ethyl on the 6-position, so maybe an addition?

First, perhaps the reaction involves a nucleophilic substitution. Since the question mentions SN2, that's a key hint. So maybe the leaving group is the cyclohexylidene part? Wait, but in an SN2 reaction, the leaving group is usually on a carbon attached to a good leaving group. Alternatively, the leaving group could be the proton in the ammonium?

Okay, if the leaving group is the double bond part, maybe the ethyl iodide is acting as a nucleophile? But ethyl iodide is a good leaving group as iodide, but as a reactant, perhaps it's acting as an alkylating agent. Wait, but the product has an ethyl attached to nitrogen.
