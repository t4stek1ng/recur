A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance? Why the correct answer is 8?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I need to figure out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance that the fast car did, which is 480 miles. Let's see... The fast car is going at 60 miles per hour, and the slow car is going half that speed. Hmm, half of 60 is 30, so the slow car is moving at 30 miles per hour. 

Wait, the question says both cars are traveling the same distance? Or does it mean the fast car traveled 480 miles and we need to find the time the slow car would take to go the same 480 miles? Let me read it again. 

"A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance? Why the correct answer is 8?"

Oh, okay. So the fast car went 480 miles, and we need to find how long the slow car took to go the same 480 miles. Wait, but maybe it's trickier? Maybe they start at the same time or something? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify any starting times or overtaking, just the speeds and the distance. Let me parse it again.

It says "If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?" So actually, maybe they are asking, when the fast car has traveled 480 miles, how much time has passed, and in that same time, how far did the slow car go? Wait, that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps they want the time it would take the slow car to cover 480 miles, not the time it takes after the fast car has done it. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Hmm. Wait, let me think again.

The problem says: "If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?" So maybe the key is "the same distance"—the slow car also went 480 miles, how long did that take. Since the fast car's 480 miles is just giving context? Maybe. Because the question is about the slow car's time for the same 480 miles.

Alternatively, maybe they want the time when both have traveled the same distance? But then the fast car's distance is 480, so when would the slow car also have gone 480? That would be the same as the first interpretation. Hmm. Probably the straightforward question is, given that the slow car is going at 30 mph, how long does it take to go 480 miles? Which would be 480 divided by 30, which is 16. Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be 8? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that both cars are traveling, and the total distance the fast car traveled is 480 miles, so how much time did the slow car take to cover the same distance? So the time for the slow car would be (480 miles) divided by (30 mph), which is 16 hours. But the user says the correct answer is 8. Hmm, so that must mean I'm missing something here. Let me see.
