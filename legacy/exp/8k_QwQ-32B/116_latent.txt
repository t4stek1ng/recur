Consider a system of 3 spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian, H, given by A*(S1*S2+S1*S3+S2*S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators of particle i. The spin-state can be represented by psi=1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3+up1*down2*up3+down1*up2*up3), where upi and downi represent the spin-up and spin-down state of particle i. Is this state an eigenfunction of H? If it is, what is its energy? If it is not, what is the expectation value of E?
Why the correct answer is It is an eigenstate of H, with eigenvalue 2/3*A*hbar^2?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The state given is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what the energy is. The answer is supposed to be an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*hbar², but I need to work through why that is.

First, I recall that for spin systems, the Hamiltonian involving terms like S_i · S_j often relates to the total spin operators. The key here is probably to use the properties of the spin operators and the given state.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of the three basis states where two spins are up and one is down. Each term in the superposition has exactly two up spins and one down, and they are all symmetrized. Since the coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), it's a normalized symmetric state.

I need to apply the Hamiltonian H to this state and see if it just multiplies the state by a constant (which would be the eigenvalue) or if it produces a different state, in which case it's not an eigenfunction, and I have to compute the expectation value.

The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let me recall that S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). However, maybe there's a better way to handle this without expanding all components. 

Alternatively, I remember that S_i · S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2 / 2 - S_i²/2 - S_j²/2. Since each spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ² for each spin. But maybe that's not immediately helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this Hamiltonian in terms of the total spin. For three spins, the total spin operator S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Rearranging, the sum of the S_i·S_j terms is (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2. 

But the Hamiltonian H is A*(sum of S_i·S_j), so substituting from the above, H = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2 ). 

Hmm, but since each individual spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ². So S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². 

Thus, H can be written as A*( [S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 ). 

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ². 

Therefore, but since each individual spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ². So S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². 

Now, H can be written as A*( [S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 ). 

Thus, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ². 

Now, but since each individual spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ². So S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². 

Hence, H can be written as A*( [S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 ). 

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ².
