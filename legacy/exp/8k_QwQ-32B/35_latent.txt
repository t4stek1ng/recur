There is a multiple-choice question: In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?
I. One's complement
II. Two's complement
III. Sign and magnitude. The options are: A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. I, II, and III. Why the correct answer is A. I only?<|im_end|>

Okay, so there's this question about 8-bit numbers and whether adding 109 and -42 is within range for different representations. The options are I, II, III which are one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude. The answer is supposed to be A, which is only I (one's complement). Hmm, I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what each of these representations are. 

Starting with sign and magnitude. In an 8-bit sign and magnitude number, the first bit is the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining 7 bits represent the magnitude. So the range here would be from -127 to +127. Wait, because with 7 bits, the maximum magnitude is 127 (since 2^7 -1 is 127). So -127 to +127. 

Then one's complement. One's complement also uses the first bit as the sign, and for negative numbers, you invert all the bits of the magnitude. The range here is the same as sign and magnitude, right? Because the magnitude part is still 7 bits? So also from -127 to +127? Wait, actually, the maximum in one's complement is still 127 for positive and -127 for negative. So same as sign and magnitude.

Wait, but maybe there's something about overflow in one's complement? Hmm. 

Then two's complement. In two's complement, the range is from -128 to +127. Because the leftmost bit is the sign bit, but the negative numbers are a bit different. So the maximum positive is 127, and the minimum is -128.

Now the question is: adding 109 and -42. Let me compute 109 + (-42) = 67. So the result should be 67, which is positive. Wait, but why would the addition be out of range? Wait, maybe when adding the actual bit patterns, there could be overflow? Wait, but 67 is within the range of all three representations, right? Since in all three, the maximum positive is 127, so 67 is well within that. So why would the question say that it's only one's complement where this addition is within range?

Hmm, maybe the question is about the intermediate steps? Like, when you represent these numbers in each system, their sum might overflow during the addition? Because even if the result is within the range, maybe in some representations the addition causes overflow?

However, maybe the question is about the intermediate steps? Like, when you represent these numbers in each system, their sum might overflow during the addition? Because even if the result is within the range, maybe I messed up the bit positions the addition causes overflow?

Hmm, maybe the question is about the intermediate steps? Like, when you represent these numbers in each system, their sum might overflow during the addition? Because even if the result is within the range, Maybe I should do the addition in decimal the addition causes overflow?
