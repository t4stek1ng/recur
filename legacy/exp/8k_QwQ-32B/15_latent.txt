Okay, so Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Let me write that down first. Axel's silver: 50, gold: 80. Now, he visits his friend Anna. The problem says Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel has. Hmm, so Anna's silver would be 2 times Axel's silver. Since Axel has 50 silver, that's 2 * 50. Let me calculate that. 2 times 50 is 100. So Anna has 100 silver pesos.

Next part: Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Wait, Axel has 80 gold pesos. So Anna's gold is Axel's gold plus 40. That would be 80 + 40. Let me add that. 80 plus 40 is 120. So Anna has 120 gold pesos. 

Now, the question is asking for the total number of pesos they have together. So I need to add up both their silver and gold pesos. Let me break it down. 

First, Axel's total: silver and gold. Axel's total is 50 + 80. 50 plus 80 is 130 pesos. 

Anna's total is her silver plus her gold, which is 100 + 120. Let me add those: 100 + 120 is 220 pesos. 

Now, the total together would be Axel's total plus Anna's total. So 130 + 220. Hmm, adding those together. 130 + 200 is 330, then plus 20 more is 350? Wait, that can't be right because the correct answer is supposed to be 700. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, let me check again. Let me recalculate each step. Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold. Anna has twice Axel's silver, so 2*50 is indeed 100. 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so 80+40=120. Then Axel's total is 50+80=130. Anna's total is 100+120=220. 130+220=350. Hmm, but the question says the correct answer is 700. That's way off. Did I misinterpret something?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. "Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together?"

First, maybe I added wrong? Let me recalculate:. Let me let A_silver = 50. "Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together?"

However, maybe it's a misinterpretation of "40 more gold pesos". Let me check the problem again. "Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together?"
