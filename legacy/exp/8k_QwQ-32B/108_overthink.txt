[overthinking]
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the problem is about a peptide chemistry reaction where a protected dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, is treated with a nucleophilic base. The result is that the azido group gets replaced by the nucleophilic base, forming a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction. The question asks which piece of evidence would be the strongest support for this mechanism, and the correct answer is the difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Hmm, I need to understand why that's the case.

First, let me recall what a β-elimination and Michael addition involves. A β-elimination would remove a proton from the β-carbon, forming a double bond, right? That would produce an enamine or some conjugated system. Then, a Michael addition would involve the nucleophilic base attacking the α-carbon of the conjugated system, adding a nucleophile there. Wait, but the problem says the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. Maybe I need to visualize the structure here.

The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Boc is a protecting group on the N-terminus, Phe is phenylalanine, then Ala(3-N3) has an azido group at the β-carbon (since Ala is a three-letter abbreviation, so the 3rd position is the β-carbon? Wait, Ala only has two carbons in its side chain, right? Wait, alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, so the α-carbon is the one connected to the amino and carboxyl groups, and the β-carbon would be the methyl carbon. But the 3-N3 indicates that the azido group is attached at the third carbon. Hmm, maybe the numbering here is different. Let me think. The amino acid structure: the α-carbon is the one connected to the amino and carboxyl groups. The side chain for alanine is just a methyl group, so that's the β-carbon. So the 3-azido would mean the azido group is attached at the β position, replacing one of the hydrogens on the β-carbon of alanine.

So when the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me break that down.

In a β-elimination, usually, you lose a proton and a leaving group to form a double bond. Wait, but here the leaving group might be the azido group? Or maybe the elimination is part of forming the conjugated system. Let me think step by step. Suppose that the azido group is at the β-carbon of alanine. The nucleophilic base could deprotonate a β-proton, leading to the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (so between the amino acid's α-carbon and the β-carbon). This would form an enamine if there's a proton withdrawal from the α-carbon. Alternatively, maybe the elimination is between the α and β carbons, creating a double bond. 

Then, the Michael addition step would be when the nucleophile attacks the α-carbon (which is electron-poor due to the conjugated double bond). Wait, but the problem states that the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. Hmm, maybe I have the steps wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, during the β-elimination, maybe the azido group leaves, along with a proton from the β-carbon? Wait, the azido might be acting as a leaving group? But azides are not great leaving groups. Maybe the elimination is of a different group? Wait, the structure is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The OMe is the ester on the C-terminus. So the azido is on the β-carbon of the alanine. 

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The alanine residue has the azido group on its β-carbon (the methyl position). The nucleophilic base attacks the β-carbon. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me see: perhaps the β-elimination step removes the azido group and a proton from the β-carbon, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. Then, the nucleophile adds to the α-carbon in a Michael addition. But that would mean the nucleophile is attacking the α-carbon, not the β-carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination forms a conjugated enamine system, and then the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is part of the conjugated system. Wait, maybe the elimination creates a double bond between the α and β carbons, making the β-carbon part of a conjugated system. The Michael addition is typically the addition of a nucleophile to the α-carbon of a conjugated enone or enamine. But here, the problem says the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. Maybe the Michael addition is happening on the β-carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step is at a different position. Maybe the β-elimination is between the α and γ carbons? That doesn't make sense for alanine's structure. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the entire dipeptide structure. The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the sequence is Phe linked to Ala, which has the azido group on its β position. The OMe is the ester group. 

Alternatively, the β-elimination might be from the Phe residue? No, the question specifies the β-carbon of the amino acid, which in this case is the Ala residue since that's where the azido group is. Wait, but Phe also has a β-carbon? Let me think: Phe has a benzyl side chain, so its α-carbon is attached to the amino and carboxyl groups, β-carbon is the first carbon of the benzene ring? No, actually, in amino acid nomenclature, the β-carbon is the one adjacent to the α-carbon, so for phenylalanine, the side chain is a phenyl group attached to the α-carbon. The β-carbon of Phe would be the α-carbon's adjacent carbon, but in the case of Phe, the α-carbon is connected to the side chain (the phenyl group), so the β-carbon would be the carbon in the peptide bond? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the azido group is on the β-carbon of the alanine residue.

Assuming the β-elimination occurs at the alanine β-carbon: if the azido group is leaving, but azido isn't a good leaving group, maybe the elimination is of a proton and the azido group stays. Wait, maybe the elimination step forms a double bond between the α and β carbons of alanine. Let me consider the structure of alanine with the azido group at β. The α-carbon is connected to the carboxyl group (from the peptide bond) and the amino group (from the previous residue, Phe). The β-carbon has the azido group and two hydrogens. If a β-elimination occurs, that would involve removing a proton from the β-carbon and the azido group? Wait, but elimination usually requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is acting as a leaving group. But azide is a leaving group, but maybe the mechanism isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination occurs between the α and β carbons, losing a water molecule or something, forming a double bond. Then, the conjugated double bond allows a Michael addition where the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon. Wait, in a typical Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the α-carbon of a conjugated system. If the conjugated system is between α and β, then attacking the β-carbon (the one next to the double bond) would be part of the conjugation. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the Michael addition is happening at the β-carbon because of the way the conjugated system is arranged.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination creates a double bond between the α and β carbons, so now the β-carbon has a double bond, and when the Michael addition occurs, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, which is now part of the conjugated system. Wait, but Michael addition is usually on the α-carbon. Let me think of the structure:

Suppose the alanine has the azido group on the β-carbon. If you remove a proton from the β-carbon and the adjacent α-carbon, forming a double bond between them. So the structure becomes: C(α)=C(β), with the azido group still attached? Wait, that might not be possible because the β-carbon already has the azido group. Maybe the elimination removes the azido group and a proton? Hmm, perhaps it's a substitution with elimination. Alternatively, maybe the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile through a different pathway.

Wait, the problem states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base. So the nucleophile bonds to the β-carbon where the azido was. So the azido leaves, and the nucleophile comes in. The mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me think of the steps again.

First, β-elimination: perhaps the azido group leaves as a leaving group, but since azido isn't a great leaving group, maybe the elimination involves removing a proton from the β-carbon and the azido group is replaced in some way. Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination forms an enamine. Wait, enamine formation typically involves loss of water and formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons. For example, in an enamine, the nitrogen (from the amine group) is conjugated with the double bond. Since this is a peptide, there's an amide group (from the peptide bond between Phe and Ala). Maybe that's the source of the conjugation.

Wait, here's another thought: the presence of an amide group (from the peptide bond) could act as an electron-withdrawing group, making the α-carbon of the alanine more susceptible to deprotonation and forming a conjugated enamine system. Then, the β-elimination would form a double bond between the α and β carbons (of the alanine), creating a conjugated system with the amide. Then, the Michael addition would involve the nucleophile attacking the β-carbon (since the conjugated double bond would have electron density on the β-carbon, making it a Michael acceptor? Wait, no. The Michael addition is the addition of a nucleophile (the base) to a conjugated system. The Michael acceptor is usually the α,β-unsaturated group, and the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon. Wait, actually, in a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the α-carbon of a conjugated enone or enamine. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact mechanism.

The classic Michael addition is the addition of a nucleophile (the "Michael donor") to the α-carbon of a conjugated enone, leading to opening of the conjugation. The Michael addition typically involves attack at the α-carbon of the conjugated system. So, if the β-elimination creates a conjugated double bond between the α and β carbons of the alanine (say, the amide group is part of the conjugation?), then the nucleophile would attack the α-carbon (of the alanine), but the problem states the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the numbering is different here.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs in a way that the double bond is between the β and γ carbons? But alanine's β is already a methyl group. Wait, maybe the β-elimination is from the previous amino acid, the Phe residue? But the azido group is on the Ala. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated without a structure.

Let me move on to the evidence part. The question asks for the strongest evidence that this β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism occurred. The options given, according to the answer, is that there's a difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.

Optical rotation is related to the presence of chiral centers and their configuration. So if the mechanism involves changing the configuration at a chiral center, that would result in a different optical rotation. Let me think about the dipeptide's chiral centers.

The starting dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Let's see the chiral centers. Phe has a chiral α-carbon (since all natural amino acids except glycine are chiral). Similarly, Ala is also chiral (but wait, alanine's side chain is a methyl group, so its α-carbon has four different groups: NH2, COOH (or ester), CH3, and the adjacent carbon from the peptide bond. Wait, actually, in the dipeptide, the α-carbon of Phe is connected to the Ala via the peptide bond. The α-carbon of Ala is connected to Phe through the peptide bond and has the β-carbon with the azido group. So both Phe and Ala have chiral α-carbons. The starting dipeptide has two chiral centers (each amino acid contributes one), so the four possible diastereomers. But since they are in the L configuration (as specified: L-phenylalanine, L-alanine), each has a specific configuration. The product would need to have a different configuration if the mechanism changes a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination and Michael addition creates a new chiral center or inverts the configuration at an existing one. Let's consider the steps again. Suppose during the elimination, if there's a formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (of the alanine), then the β-carbon (originally part of the side chain) would now be part of the double bond, which might affect its configuration.

Wait, the original alanine has a β-carbon with the azido group. Let's think of the β-carbon as having the azido group and two hydrogens (since it's a methyl group, normally three hydrogens, but one is replaced by azido). If during the β-elimination, the azido group leaves along with a proton, forming a double bond between α and β carbons, then the β-carbon would now be part of a double bond. Wait, but the azido group is leaving? Not sure. Let me think of the actual steps:

Alternatively, suppose the β-elimination removes a proton from the β-carbon and the adjacent proton from the α-carbon, creating a double bond between them. Wait, but that might be a deprotonation. If the nucleophilic base abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond with the α-carbon, then the geometry of the double bond (cis or trans) could affect the configuration. Wait, maybe the formation of the double bond would lead to a change in the configuration at the α-carbon?

Alternatively, when the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon during the Michael addition, that might lead to a new chiral center or inversion at an existing one. Let's think about the Michael addition mechanism. In a typical Michael addition, if the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (as the Michael acceptor?), the stereochemistry of attack would depend on the configuration of the double bond. If the double bond is in a certain configuration (cis or trans), the nucleophile might attack from a specific side, leading to a specific stereochemistry. 

Alternatively, if the elimination creates a conjugated double bond with a certain geometry, the addition of the nucleophile will have a stereospecific attack, leading to an inversion or retention at a chiral center. Therefore, if the starting material has a certain configuration (R or S) at a chiral center, and the product has a different one, that would indicate a change in configuration, which is evidence for a specific mechanism where such a change occurs.

In the starting dipeptide, the alanine's α-carbon is a chiral center (since it's L-alanine, so the configuration is fixed). The β-carbon (the one with the azido group) isn't a chiral center because it has two hydrogens and the azido group (but wait, if the β-carbon is part of a methyl group with one H removed, then it has three groups: azido, two H, and the α-C? Wait, the β-carbon of alanine is connected to the α-carbon (Cα), the azido, and two hydrogens. Since the β-carbon has three hydrogens and one substituent (azido), it's not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups. Therefore, the β-carbon itself isn't chiral. However, when the double bond is formed between α and β carbons, perhaps the α-carbon's configuration changes?

Wait, the α-carbon of alanine is part of the peptide bond. The peptide bond between Phe and Ala would fix the conformation, but the α-carbon's configuration (its chiral center) is determined by the L configuration. If during the β-elimination and Michael addition, the configuration at the α-carbon is inverted, that would change the optical rotation. 

Alternatively, when the Michael addition occurs, if the nucleophile attacks from one side of the double bond, it might invert the configuration at the α-carbon. Wait, let me think. Suppose the double bond between α and β creates a planar system. The nucleophile approaches either side, leading to either retention or inversion. If the reaction proceeds through a carbocation intermediate, then the configuration could be randomized, but that's more of an SN1 mechanism. Alternatively, in a concerted mechanism like a Michael addition, the approach of the nucleophile could lead to inversion at a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that during the elimination and addition steps, the configuration at the α-carbon of the alanine is changed. Since the starting material has a specific configuration (L-alanine, so the α-carbon has the NH, COOH (or ester), CH3, and the adjacent Phe residue), changing the configuration at that center would result in a different enantiomer, thus changing the optical rotation.

Alternatively, maybe a new chiral center is formed during the reaction. For instance, if the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, which previously was not a chiral center, but now becomes one because the incoming nucleophile introduces a different group. Wait, the β-carbon originally had the azido group and two hydrogens. After replacement by the nucleophile, it now has the nucleophile group, one H, and the other groups. If the β-carbon now has four different groups, it becomes a new chiral center, leading to a different optical rotation. 

Ah, that's a good point. The original β-carbon (of the alanine) had three groups: azido, two hydrogens, and the α-carbon. But when the azido is replaced by the nucleophilic base, the β-carbon now has the nucleophile, two hydrogens, and the α-carbon. Wait, no, actually the β-carbon is connected to the α-carbon (from alanine's α), the nucleophile, the azido group (but it's replaced), so actually replacing the azido with the nucleophile would give the β-carbon four groups: α-C, nucleophile, and two H? Wait, no. Let me count again. The β-carbon (originally part of the alanine's side chain, which is a methyl group with an azido on it) has the following groups:

- The α-carbon (since it's the β position, it's attached to the α-carbon of alanine).

- The azido group (N3).

- Two hydrogens (since it was originally a methyl group, so three H's, but one is replaced by N3).

Wait, actually, a methyl group has three H's. If one is replaced by azido, then the β-carbon has two H's left, plus the azido and the α-carbon. So after substitution, the β-carbon would have the nucleophile (from the base), two H's, and the α-carbon (so four different groups if the nucleophile is different from the original azido group). Wait, but the original β-carbon had azido and two H's. After substitution, the nucleophile replaces the azido, so the groups are nucleophile, two H's, and the α-C. However, the two H's are identical, so the groups are: α-C, nucleophile, and two H's (which are the same). Therefore, the β-carbon still wouldn't be a chiral center because it has two identical H's, so it would have three different groups (α-C, nucleophile, and H) plus one H. Wait, that would be three different groups plus the H? Wait, no. Let me think again.

The β-carbon has four substituents:

- The α-carbon (from the alanine's α position),

- The group that was the azido (now replaced by the nucleophile),

- Two hydrogens.

But if the nucleophile is a different group than the azido, then the substituents are:

- α-C,

- nucleophile,

- H,

- H.

So, two hydrogens are identical, so the substituents are three unique groups (α-C, nucleophile, H) and one H again. Wait, no, that's still only three different groups. Therefore, the β-carbon wouldn't be a chiral center. Hmm, so maybe the chiral center is elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the α-carbon of the alanine might have its configuration changed. The α-carbon of alanine has the following groups: attached to the carboxylate (or ester) group from the peptide bond to the previous residue (Phe), an amide hydrogen (since it's an amino acid in a peptide), the side chain (which is the β-carbon with three substituents), and the remaining group (the next residue's amide?). Wait, maybe the α-carbon is part of the peptide bond, so its configuration is fixed in the L-configuration. However, if during the elimination and addition steps, the bond to the side chain is altered, maybe the configuration could change?

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond between the α and β carbons of alanine. If the double bond is formed with a certain geometry (cis or trans), that could influence the configuration. But how does that relate to optical rotation?

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the mechanism involves a change in the number of chiral centers or their configuration. If the Michael addition creates a new chiral center, then the product would have a different number of chiral centers than the starting material, leading to a different optical rotation. Alternatively, if a chiral center's configuration is inverted, that would also lead to a different optical rotation. 

The starting dipeptide has two chiral centers (Phe and Ala), each in the L configuration, so their absolute configurations are fixed. The product would also have those two chiral centers unless the mechanism somehow changes their configuration. Alternatively, if the reaction creates a new chiral center at the β position, then the product would have three chiral centers, leading to a different optical rotation.

Wait, let's think again about the β-carbon. Originally, it was not chiral (since it had two H's). After substitution by the nucleophile, if the β-carbon now has four different substituents, it would become a new chiral center. Let's check again: 

Original β-carbon of alanine (before reaction):

- Attached to α-carbon (from alanine's α),

- Azido group,

- Two hydrogens.

After substituting azido with the nucleophile:

- Attached to α-carbon,

- Nucleophile,

- Two hydrogens.

Wait, that's still three groups (since two H's are identical), so it's not a chiral center. Unless the nucleophile is a different group and the H's are considered different? No, they are the same. Therefore, the β-carbon remains non-chiral.

Hmm, so maybe the chiral center is at the α-carbon of the alanine. Let me consider that.

The α-carbon of alanine is a chiral center. Its configuration is L, so in the dipeptide, it has its four substituents: the amide group from the previous residue (Phe), the side chain (which is the β-carbon with azido), the amide hydrogen (NH), and the carboxyl group (from the peptide bond). Wait, in a peptide bond, the α-carbon is connected to the previous residue's carboxyl group (as an amide) and the next residue's nitrogen. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure.

In a dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala-OMe, the structure is Boc-protected N-terminus, then Phe linked to Ala through a peptide bond, then the C-terminus is OMe. The α-carbon of Phe is connected to the carboxyl group (which forms the peptide bond with Ala's α-amino group). The α-carbon of Ala is connected to Phe's carboxyl (through the peptide bond), its own side chain (the β-carbon with azido), and the amide hydrogen. Since it's L-alanine, its configuration is fixed.

If during the reaction, the α-carbon's configuration is inverted (from L to D), that would change the optical rotation. However, how would this happen? If the elimination and addition steps involve a conrotatory change that flips the configuration?

Alternatively, during the Michael addition, if the nucleophile approaches from a specific side, it could invert the configuration at the α-carbon. For example, if the double bond formed during elimination has a certain geometry, the nucleophile attacks from the opposite face, leading to inversion at the α-carbon. This would change its configuration from L to D, resulting in a different optical rotation. 

The starting dipeptide has both amino acids in the L configuration, resulting in a specific optical rotation. If the product has one of them now in D configuration, the optical rotation would be different. However, since it's a dipeptide, flipping one amino acid's configuration would invert the sign of the optical rotation (if it's the only chiral center changed). Alternatively, if the configuration is inverted at the alanine's α-carbon, that would reverse its rotation, leading to a difference in the optical rotation between the product and the starting material. 

Therefore, the presence of a different optical rotation would indicate a change in configuration at a chiral center, which would be evidence that the mechanism involves such a change, as in the proposed β-elimination and Michael addition. If the mechanism proceeded without changing any chiral centers (just a substitution), the optical rotation would remain the same, but if there's a change, it's a sign that the mechanism caused a configuration change, supporting the proposed steps.

Other possible evidence might include the isolation of an intermediate, but that's not mentioned. Spectral evidence like NMR showing conjugated systems (from the double bond) could also be evidence, but the question specifies the strongest evidence. The optical rotation being different is a direct indication of a change in the molecule's stereochemistry, which is a key part of the mechanism. Since β-elimination and Michael addition can lead to such changes, that's why this is the strongest evidence.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in the reaction of the dipeptide **Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe** with a nucleophilic base is **a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. This difference directly indicates a change in the stereochemistry of the molecule during the reaction, which is critical to confirming the proposed mechanism. Here's why:

### Key Explanation:
1. **Chiral Centers in the Starting Dipeptide**:
   - The starting dipeptide contains **two chiral centers**: the α-carbons of both **Phe** and **Ala**, which are in the **L configuration** (as specified). These chiral centers dictate the **optical rotation** of the molecule.

2. **Mechanism Steps and Stereochemical Changes**:
   - **β-Elimination**: Formation of a double bond between the α- and β-carbons of the alanine residue (due to deprotonation and elimination). This creates a conjugated system (e.g., an enamine or double bond) between the α- and β-carbons.
   - **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic base attacks the β-carbon (now part of the conjugated system), resulting in bond formation. This attack can occur from a specific face of the double bond, leading to **inversion of configuration** at the α-carbon of alanine or **creation of a new chiral center** at the β-carbon (if the substitution introduces four distinct groups).

3. **Optical Rotation Change as Evidence**:
   - If the mechanism proceeds via inversion of configuration at the α-carbon of alanine (e.g., flipping from L to D), or if a **new chiral center** is formed at the β-carbon (e.g., due to asymmetric substitution by the nucleophile), the overall stereochemistry of the molecule changes. 
   - This change would alter the molecule’s **optical rotation**, shifting its magnitude (e.g., reversing the sign or reducing the value). Such a difference directly supports the proposed mechanism involving stereochemical rearrangement during the reaction steps.

4. **Alternative Evidence Considered**:
   - While spectroscopic evidence (e.g., IR or NMR showing conjugated systems) or intermediate isolation could also support the mechanism, optical rotation is the **most direct** indicator of a stereochemical change. The β-elimination and Michael addition inherently involve bond rearrangements that disrupt and reform chiral centers, making optical rotation a definitive metric for mechanism confirmation.

### Conclusion:
The observed difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and product provides unambiguous evidence of stereochemical changes consistent with the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism. This aligns with the mechanism’s requirement for bond rearrangements at chiral centers or the creation of new ones, which cannot occur without altering the molecule’s optical properties. 

**Answer:**  
The difference in optical rotation indicates a change in stereochemistry, which is a direct consequence of the β-elimination and Michael addition steps altering the configuration at a chiral center or creating a new one. This is the strongest evidence for the proposed mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about a peptide chemistry reaction where a protected dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, is treated with a nucleophilic base. The result is that the azido group (N3) is replaced by the nucleophile, which ends up bonding to the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The question is asking which piece of evidence would most strongly support this mechanism, and the correct answer is that there's a difference in the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out why that's the case.

First, let me recall what β-elimination and Michael addition mean. A β-elimination typically involves removing a proton and a leaving group (like water or another nucleophile) from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. In amino acids, this might happen at the β-carbon, which is the carbon adjacent to the alpha carbon (the one attached to the N and C termini). A Michael addition is when a nucleophile (the Michael donor) attacks an electron-deficient carbon in a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So if there's a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition, the sequence would be: first, eliminate a group from the β-carbon, forming a double bond, then the nucleophile attacks the conjugated system.

The starting material is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Let me parse that structure. Boc is a t-butoxycarbonyl group, protecting the N-terminus. The dipeptide is Phe (phenylalanine) connected to Ala(3-N3), which is an alanine with an azide (N3) group at the 3rd carbon. The OMe is the ester group at the C-terminus. So the structure would be:

Boc-Protected Phe - Ala(3-N3) - OMe

The azido group is on the β-carbon of the alanine (since Ala's side chain is a methyl group, so the β-carbon is the one attached to the side chain). Wait, actually, alanine's side chain is -CH3, so the β-carbon is the one adjacent to the α-carbon (which is connected to the carboxylic acid and the nitrogen). So the 3-N3 is on that β-carbon.

When the azide is replaced by the nucleophile, the nucleophile bonds to the β-carbon. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me think about the steps.

In β-elimination, you might lose a group. If the azide is leaving, perhaps via elimination, but elimination usually requires a good leaving group. Azide is a decent leaving group under basic conditions? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the elimination happens first, where the β-carbon loses a proton and another group (maybe the N3 is the leaving group here) to form a double bond. Wait, elimination reactions typically remove a proton and a leaving group. For example, in E2 elimination, the base abstracts a proton, and the leaving group leaves, forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons. 

Assuming that the azido group is the leaving group here, then elimination would form a double bond between the β-carbon (which is now deprotonated) and the next carbon (maybe the α-carbon?), forming an enamine or an imine? Wait, the α-carbon is part of the amide bond in the peptide, so maybe the double bond forms between the β-carbon of the alanine and the γ-carbon? Hmm, perhaps the structure is more complex. Let me try to draw the structure mentally.

The alanine in the dipeptide has the following structure: the α-carbon is connected to the carboxylic acid (which is esterified to OMe?), the amine (connected to the Phe residue), the β-carbon (which has the azide group), and the side chain (methyl group). Wait, actually, in amino acids, the α-carbon is connected to the amino group, the carboxylic acid, and the two side chain carbons. For alanine, the side chain is just a methyl group. So the β-carbon is the one adjacent to the α, so it is the carbon that's part of the side chain. Wait, no. Wait, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups. The β-carbon is the next one in the side chain. Since alanine only has a methyl side chain, which is just one carbon (the β-carbon). So the β-carbon is the side chain carbon with the methyl group and the azide here.

Wait, the question says "Ala(3-N3)", so maybe the numbering is different. In amino acid numbering, the α is the carbon attached to N and C termini, then the β is the next in the backbone? Wait, actually, in amino acids, the α-carbon is the central carbon, and the side chain carbons are β, γ, etc. So for alanine, the side chain is just the β-carbon with a methyl group. Therefore, the 3-N3 would be the β-carbon. So the azide is on the β-carbon of the alanine.

So when they say the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile forming a bond to the β-carbon, so the nucleophile comes in and attacks the β-carbon where the N3 used to be. The mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me think of the steps.

First, β-elimination. That would involve removing a proton and a leaving group. The leaving group here might be the azide. Wait, but azide is a leaving group? Maybe not under basic conditions unless something is protonated. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a beta hydrogen, and the azide leaves, forming a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons? But the alpha carbon is part of the peptide bond. Maybe the elimination is between the beta and gamma carbons, but alanine only has the beta. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to consider the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination is between the β-carbon (with the azide) and the γ-carbon. But since alanine only has a methyl group on the β, there is no γ. Wait, maybe the elimination is from the alanine's β-carbon (the side chain) and the α-carbon (the main chain). But the α-carbon is part of the amide bond in the dipeptide. If the elimination occurs, perhaps forming a double bond between the α and β carbons, which would make the α carbon sp2 hybridized. That might form an enamine structure because the α-carbon is adjacent to the amide nitrogen. Wait, the amide is a double bond already, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms an imine? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the elimination step leads to the formation of a conjugated double bond that allows a Michael addition. Let me think of the Michael addition: the nucleophile attacks the β carbon of a conjugated enone or similar. Wait, if there's a double bond formed between the β (formerly with azide) and another carbon, creating a conjugated system, the nucleophile could then attack the α carbon (the Michael addition step). 

So, the β-elimination would remove a proton and the azide (maybe as N2?), forming a double bond between the β-carbon and the adjacent carbon. Then the conjugated double bond would allow the nucleophile to perform a Michael addition, attacking the α or β carbon. Wait, the question says the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. So perhaps the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon after the elimination forms a conjugated system that makes the β-carbon more electrophilic?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a vinyl or allyl species, which then reacts with the nucleophile. Hmm. The key here is that the mechanism involves a β-elimination followed by Michael addition. 

The question is asking what evidence would support this mechanism. The options given (though not listed here) have the correct answer as a difference in optical rotation between starting material and product. 

So why would that be the case? Optical rotation is due to the presence of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves forming or breaking a chiral center, then the optical rotation would change. Let me think.

The starting material is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Phe is phenylalanine, which has a chiral α-carbon (like all L-amino acids). The Ala(3-N3) is also an L-amino acid, so its α-carbon is chiral. The 3-N3 is on the β-carbon of the alanine, which is part of the side chain. Since alanine's side chain is a methyl group, the β-carbon is just a CH2 group with the methyl and the azide. Wait, no—the β-carbon in this case is the side chain carbon for alanine. So the side chain is CH2CH3 normally, but here the β (which is actually the only side chain carbon) has an azide. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the β-carbon is the carbon adjacent to the α, so in alanine, the α is connected to the amino and carboxy groups, and the β is the side chain carbon. Since that's the only carbon in the side chain, substituting it with an azide would keep the chirality at the α, but also introduce a new chiral center? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In standard L-alanine, the α-carbon is the chiral center. The side chain is -CH3, which is attached to the α-carbon. The β-carbon would be the one beyond the α, but in alanine, there is no β beyond the α because the side chain is only one carbon. So substituting that β-carbon (the side chain carbon) with an azide would not create a new chiral center because the beta carbon would be attached to: 

- The alpha carbon (which is part of the backbone)
- A methyl group (original side chain)
- The azido group (N3)
- The remaining bond would be to the next carbon? Wait, no. The side chain is only one carbon. So the β-carbon (side chain carbon) has four groups: the alpha carbon (connected via single bond), the azido group, a methyl group, and the other two bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the β carbon is the side chain's carbon. Since it's a methyl group in normal alanine, substituting the methyl to have an azido instead would make the β-carbon have different groups. Wait, actually, replacing the methyl (which was a CH3) with an azide (N3) would mean the β-carbon is connected to: 

- The α-carbon (single bond)
- The azido group (N3)
- A hydrogen (since it was CH3 before, now it's R is N3, so maybe it's CH2N3? Wait, no. Wait, the side chain in alanine is normally CH3, so the β-carbon (the side chain carbon) has a methyl group. If you replace that with an azide, it becomes CH2-N3? Wait, that would be an ethyl group with azido, but alanine's side chain is only one carbon. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the azide is at position 3 of the alanine, which would be the β-carbon. So the side chain carbon (normally CH3) is now CH2-N3? So that's a substitution on that carbon. Wait, maybe the substituents on the β-carbon are: 

- Attached to α (so one bond)
- A hydrogen (since it was CH3 before, but now part of it is replaced by N3)
- The azido group (N3)
- The remaining group? Wait, if it's a CH2 group with two hydrogens replaced by N3 and maybe another group? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The key point is that the starting dipeptide has certain chiral centers. The phenylalanine has its α-carbon as a chiral center (L configuration), and the alanine also has its α-carbon as a chiral center (L). The β-carbon (side chain carbon) in alanine is CH2-N3. Since that carbon is connected to four different groups: the α-carbon (connected via single bond), the azido group, a hydrogen, and another hydrogen? Wait, no—if it was a CH2 group with N3, then it would have two hydrogens, so it's not a chiral center. Wait, unless the substitution is different. Let me think: if the β carbon (side chain) was originally CH3 (so all three hydrogens), then replacing one H with N3 would leave two H's, making it CH2N3. In that case, the side chain carbon would have groups: CH2-N3. So attached to the α-carbon, two hydrogens, and the azido group. That's only three different groups (if the two H's are considered the same). So that carbon would not be chiral. So the alanine(3-N3) still has only one chiral center (the α-carbon). 

Therefore, the starting material has two chiral centers (Phe's α and Ala's α), both in L configuration. The product, after the reaction, has the azido group replaced by the nucleophile. So the β-carbon (side chain of alanine) now has the nucleophile attached. Let me think about the product structure.

Assuming the mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let's imagine that during β-elimination, the azido group is lost, and a double bond is formed between the β (now losing the N3) and maybe the α-carbon? Wait, but the α is part of the amide bond. Alternatively, maybe between the β and another carbon. 

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination leads to loss of N3 as N2 (azide leaving as N2?), forming a double bond with the next carbon. Wait, without a detailed mechanism, it's a bit hard, but perhaps the key point is that the β-elimination and Michael addition might result in a change in the stereochemistry at a chiral center or the creation of a new chiral center.

If the mechanism involves a reaction that proceeds through an achiral intermediate, then the stereochemistry could invert or lead to a new configuration. Alternatively, if a new chiral center is formed during the reaction, the product would have a different number of chiral centers, leading to a different optical rotation. 

Wait, the starting material has two chiral centers (both L). The product, after reaction, might have a different configuration at one of those chiral centers, or a new chiral center. 

Alternatively, during the elimination and addition steps, the β-carbon (which was not a chiral center before) becomes a chiral center. Let me think:

Suppose the β-elimination step causes the β-carbon to lose the azido group and form a double bond, maybe with the α-carbon. But the α-carbon is part of the amide bond. Alternatively, perhaps the β-carbon loses a proton and the azide as a leaving group, forming a double bond with the adjacent carbon. For instance, if the β-carbon (originally CH2-N3) loses N3 and a proton from the adjacent carbon, forming a double bond between β and γ? But there is no γ in alanine. Maybe the β is connected to another carbon in the peptide? Wait, the peptide is Phe-Ala, so the alanine is connected via its α-amino group to the Phe's carboxyl. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination is across the amide bond? That seems unlikely. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination leads to formation of an enamine. Since the α-carbon is adjacent to the amide nitrogen, deprotonating and eliminating could form an imine or enamine. If the elimination leads to a double bond between the α and β carbons (the side chain), then the α-carbon might now be sp2 hybridized, making it planar, so the original chiral center (α) might lose its chirality? Wait, but that would require the α-carbon to lose a hydrogen. If the α-carbon was part of a double bond, it might still be chiral unless the configuration is changed.

Alternatively, perhaps during the elimination step, the β-carbon (which was not a chiral center) becomes a chiral center. Let's see: suppose the β-carbon (originally CH2-N3) loses N3 and a proton, forming a double bond with the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe losing N3 and a proton from the α or another carbon. Let me think of a specific scenario.

Suppose the β-elimination occurs between the β-carbon (with N3) and the α-carbon. The base deprotonates a β-hydrogen, and the azide leaves as N3-, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. The α-carbon is now sp2, so the original chiral center (α) might still have its configuration, but now the β-carbon (now double bonded to α) is part of a double bond and might have different groups. Wait, but the double bond would mean that the β-carbon is now sp2, so maybe it's not a chiral center anymore. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different arrangement where a new chiral center is formed. Alternatively, maybe the Michael addition step creates a new chiral center. For instance, if the nucleophile adds to a conjugated system (e.g., an enone or enamine), the addition could occur with a preference for one face of the double bond, leading to a new chiral center. 

Alternatively, if the Michael addition proceeds through a transition state that allows for the formation of a new chiral center. Let's say the double bond formed during elimination is conjugated, and the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (where the azide was originally). The attack could result in a new group attached to the β-carbon, making it a chiral center if it wasn't before. 

Wait, in the original starting material, the β-carbon had CH2-N3. If after elimination, the β-carbon is connected to the adjacent carbon via double bond, and then the nucleophile adds a group there, replacing one of the substituents. Suppose the β-carbon ends up with four different groups: the double bond, the nucleophile's group, and the remaining substituents. If those groups are all different, then the β-carbon becomes a new chiral center. 

Alternatively, maybe the original α-carbon (the chiral center) has its configuration inverted during the reaction, leading to a different optical rotation. 

But the key point is that the optical rotation changes because there's a difference in the chiral centers' configurations. Optical rotation is a measure of the molecule's chirality. If the mechanism causes a change in the configuration at an existing chiral center or creates a new one, the optical rotation would change. 

The question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, forming a bond to the β-carbon. If the β-carbon was not a chiral center before (as in the starting material where it had CH2-N3 with two hydrogens), but after the reaction, the nucleophile adds a group there, and if that leads to four different groups on the β-carbon (making it a new chiral center), then the product would have an additional chiral center, leading to a different optical rotation. Alternatively, if the original chiral centers are affected (like inversion at the α-carbon), that would also change the rotation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds through an achiral intermediate, leading to a mixture of enantiomers, but since the starting material is pure, the product might still have optical activity but different. Wait, but if the reaction leads to inversion or retention at a chiral center, the optical rotation would change accordingly. 

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism would be something that indicates that a specific kind of reaction pathway occurred. For instance, if there's a new chiral center formed (because the β-carbon became chiral), then the product would have a different optical rotation than the starting material. Alternatively, if the original chiral centers were inverted, that would also cause a change. 

Other possible evidence might include the formation of a conjugated system (like UV-vis spectroscopy showing a shift in absorption due to a conjugated double bond), or NMR showing the formation of a double bond, but the question specifies that the correct answer is the optical rotation difference. 

Therefore, the reasoning is that during the elimination and addition steps, the stereochemistry at a chiral center has changed or a new chiral center is formed. This would lead to a change in optical rotation because optical rotation is determined by the arrangement of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves the formation of a new chiral center or a change in configuration at an existing one, the measured optical rotation of the product would differ from the starting material. 

In contrast, if the mechanism were, say, a simple nucleophilic substitution at the β-carbon without changing any chiral centers, the optical rotation might not change (if the substitution is at a non-chiral center and doesn't affect existing chiral centers). But if the mechanism involves a change in stereochemistry, then the optical rotation would differ. 

So the presence of a different optical rotation is strong evidence that the stereochemistry has changed, which would be consistent with a β-elimination-Michael addition pathway where such changes occur. For example, if the β-elimination led to an achiral intermediate, followed by a Michael addition that introduces a new chiral center or inverts an existing one. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that there is a difference in optical rotation because it indicates a change in the molecule's stereochemistry, which aligns with the proposed mechanism involving such a pathway.
</think>

The strongest evidence supporting the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Mechanism Overview**:  
   The proposed mechanism involves two key steps:  
   - **β-Elimination**: The azido group (N₃) on the β-carbon of the alanine side chain is eliminated, forming a conjugated double bond.  
   - **Michael Addition**: A nucleophile attacks the conjugated system, forming a bond to the β-carbon where the azido group was originally.  

2. **Stereochemical Changes**:  
   - The starting material, **Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe**, has two chiral centers: the α-carbons of both Phe and Ala (both in the L configuration).  
   - During β-elimination, the β-carbon (originally not a chiral center, as it bore CH₂-N₃ with two hydrogens) may form a new chiral center due to the addition of the nucleophile. The β-carbon now becomes bonded to four distinct groups (e.g., the conjugated double bond, the nucleophile's group, and remaining substituents), creating a new stereocenter.  
   - Alternatively, the reaction might alter the configuration at an existing chiral center (e.g., inversion at the α-carbon of alanine due to the elimination step).  

3. **Optical Rotation as Evidence**:  
   - Optical rotation is sensitive to the arrangement of chiral centers. A change in optical rotation indicates a difference in stereochemistry between the starting material and product.  
   - If a new chiral center forms or the configuration of an existing one changes during the reaction, the product will exhibit a different optical rotation compared to the starting material.  
   - In contrast, other evidence (e.g., spectroscopic changes) might suggest a reaction occurred but not specifically confirm the stereochemical pathway. The optical rotation difference directly links to stereochemical changes inherent to β-elimination and Michael addition.  

4. **Why Other Evidence Is Less Specific**:  
   While NMR or IR might show new bonds or conjugated systems, these could arise from multiple mechanisms. Only a change in optical rotation definitively points to stereochemical alterations consistent with the proposed mechanism.  

**Conclusion**: The difference in optical rotation provides clear evidence that the mechanism involved changes in chirality at either existing or new stereocenters, aligning with β-elimination followed by Michael addition.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that there's a difference in the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product, right? Let me start by recalling the question. The reaction involves a protected dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The azido group (N3) on the alanine is being replaced by a nucleophilic base. The mechanism proposed is a beta-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The question is asking for the strongest evidence supporting this mechanism, and the answer given is the optical rotation difference. Hmm, okay.

First, let me break down the reaction. The dipeptide has Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) protecting the N-terminus, Phe (phenylalanine) as the first amino acid, then Ala(3-N3) which is an alanine with an azido group on the beta carbon (since alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, so the beta carbon is the one adjacent to the alpha carbon). The OMe is the methyl ester at the C-terminus.

The reaction is treated with a nucleophilic base, leading to replacement of the azido group with the nucleophile. The mechanism suggested is beta-elimination followed by Michael addition. Beta-elimination typically involves the removal of a beta proton and a leaving group to form a double bond. Then a Michael addition would be the addition of a nucleophile to the conjugated double bond.

Wait, in this case, the azido group is on the beta carbon. So maybe the beta-elimination would involve the azido group leaving? Let me think.

Starting with the dipeptide structure. Let me try to visualize it. The Phe is attached to the alpha carbon of Ala, which has the azido group on its beta carbon. The beta-elimination might involve deprotonation at the beta carbon (adjacent to the alpha), leading to the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the alanine. Then the azido group would leave as a leaving group? But azides aren't typically very good leaving groups, unless they are converted into something else, maybe through some protonation?

Alternatively, maybe the beta-elimination is from the alpha carbon of the alanine? Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the structure more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is similar to an alpha-elimination but on the beta carbon. Wait, beta-elimination would be removing a proton from the beta carbon and the leaving group from the gamma? No, maybe I need to recall that beta-elimination generally refers to the elimination of a proton two carbons away from the leaving group. Wait, maybe I should think of the general mechanism here.

The key point here is that during beta-elimination, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile via a conjugate addition. The Michael addition part is the nucleophile attacking the double bond formed in the elimination step. But how does that lead to a change in optical rotation?

Optical rotation is related to the 3D structure of the molecule, specifically the presence of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves a change in the configuration around a chiral center, that would change the optical rotation. Alternatively, if a new chiral center is formed or an existing one is inverted, that would affect the optical activity.

Let me think: the starting dipeptide has certain chiral centers. Phe has a chiral alpha carbon (the normal amino acid chirality), as does the Ala. The Ala(3-N3) has the azido on its beta carbon, but since alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, the beta carbon is the one adjacent to the alpha (the one connected to the carbonyl). Wait, alanine is CH(CH3)COOH. So the alpha carbon is the one connected to the amino and carboxyl groups, and the beta carbon is the CH3. Wait no, actually, in amino acids, the alpha carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups, so the side chain (for alanine) is a methyl group on the alpha carbon? Wait, no. Wait, amino acid nomenclature: the carbon chain is numbered such that the amino group is on the alpha carbon, so the side chain is attached to the alpha carbon. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, the beta carbon would be the next one along the chain. Wait, but for alanine, the side chain is just a methyl group on the alpha carbon. The beta carbon would be the one adjacent to the alpha (the next carbon in the chain). Wait, in an amino acid, the structure is: N-terminus (like Boc here) attached to the alpha carbon via the peptide bond, then the side chain. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the dipeptide structure step by step.

Let me think of the dipeptide structure more clearly. The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the sequence is Boc (blocking group) on the N-terminus of Phe, then Phe is connected via a peptide bond to Ala, which has an azido group on its 3rd carbon, which is the beta carbon (since the numbering for alanine's side chain would be the methyl group as the side chain, so the beta carbon would be the next one in the chain? Hmm, perhaps the numbering is as follows:

In the amino acid, the alpha carbon is the one connected to the amino and carboxyl groups. The beta carbon would be the next carbon in the chain. For alanine, which is a straight chain with a methyl group on the alpha carbon, the beta carbon would be the one adjacent to the alpha, but in the case of a dipeptide, the alpha carbon of the alanine is connected to the Phe via the peptide bond. Wait, maybe the numbering for the alanine's own side chain? Hmm, perhaps the 3-N3 means that the azido is on the third carbon of the alanine? Wait, alanine only has two carbons: the alpha carbon and the methyl group (so actually, the alpha carbon is connected to the COOH, amino group, and the methyl as its side chain). Wait, actually, alanine is CH3CH(NH2)COOH. So the main chain up to the alpha carbon is the carbonyl, then the alpha carbon has the NH2, COOH, and the methyl group. So the beta carbon would be the one attached to the alpha carbon via a single bond? Wait no, there's no beta carbon in alanine's side chain. Wait, maybe the numbering here is different. Wait, perhaps the Ala(3-N3) refers to the 3-position in the dipeptide? Wait no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering for the side chain: for alanine, since its side chain is a methyl group (only one carbon), then the azido group is added to the beta carbon of the alanine residue. Since in the amino acid, the side chain is on the alpha carbon, so the beta carbon would be the next carbon along the chain. Wait, but in the dipeptide context, the alanine is connected through its alpha carbon to the Phe via the peptide bond. So the beta carbon of alanine would be the carbon adjacent to the alpha (the one connected to the Phe), so that's the one in the main chain? Wait, perhaps I need to draw this out mentally.

Alternatively, maybe the 3 in 3-N3 refers to the position in the alanine side chain. But since alanine's side chain is a methyl group (only one carbon), maybe that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the numbering here is different. Maybe the 3 refers to the position in the dipeptide? Hmm, perhaps the question is using a different numbering.

Alternatively, maybe the 3-N3 refers to the carbon position in the alanine residue. Wait, perhaps in the dipeptide, the protected dipeptide has the Boc group on the N-terminus of Phe, then Phe's C-terminus is connected to the N-terminus of the Ala, which has its side chain's third carbon? Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should consider that the azido group is on the beta carbon of the alanine (the carbon adjacent to the alpha carbon, which is part of the main chain).

Assuming that the azido group is on the beta carbon of the alanine residue. Then, during beta-elimination, perhaps the azido group leaves, forming a double bond with the alpha carbon. Then the nucleophile can attack via a Michael addition.

Wait, beta-elimination usually involves the removal of a proton and a leaving group from adjacent carbons. So if the azido group is a leaving group (maybe protonated to be a better leaving group?), then beta-elimination would remove a proton from the beta carbon and the azido leaving group from the alpha? Or vice versa?

Alternatively, maybe the elimination is between the alpha and beta carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond between them, with the azido group leaving as N3-?

Hmm. Let me think of the steps again. The reaction is with a nucleophilic base, which replaces the azido group. The mechanism proposed is beta-elimination followed by Michael addition.

In beta-elimination, two adjacent carbons lose a proton and a leaving group to form a double bond. Here, the azido group is on the beta carbon. So maybe the beta carbon (with azido) and the alpha carbon (connected to the rest of the peptide) undergo elimination, losing the azido group and a proton, forming a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. Then the nucleophile attacks the double bond in a Michael addition.

Wait, but in that case, the formation of the double bond would be between the alpha and beta carbons of the alanine. The alpha carbon is part of the peptide bond with Phe, so that's a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the elimination is from the alanine's side chain? Wait, but the side chain is only a methyl group, unless the azido is on the beta carbon of the alanine's main chain?

Alternatively, maybe the beta elimination is on the Phe side? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's think of the mechanism as follows:

Start with the dipeptide. The azido group is on the beta carbon of the alanine. The nucleophilic base deprotonates a beta proton (on the beta carbon), leading to the formation of a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, while the azido group is eliminated. Then the nucleophile attacks the double bond in a Michael addition, forming a new bond with the beta carbon. Wait, but where does the nucleophile come in?

Wait, the nucleophilic base might first abstract a proton from the beta carbon (adjacent to the azido group?), creating a carbanion, which could then attack the carbonyl carbon (the alpha?), leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's more like the azido group leaving as a leaving group, with a proton being abstracted from the beta carbon, resulting in the double bond. Then the nucleophile adds to the double bond.

In any case, after the elimination and addition steps, the overall result is that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. But crucially, the mechanism involves a conjugate addition, which can lead to a change in configuration if there's a chiral center involved.

Now, the key here is the optical rotation. If the mechanism involves a change in the configuration at a chiral center, that would change the optical rotation. So if during the elimination or the addition step, there's an inversion or a new chiral center formed, that would lead to a different enantiomer or diastereomer, thus altering the optical rotation.

Alternatively, if the original dipeptide has a certain configuration, and the reaction leads to an inversion or formation of a different configuration, the optical rotation would change. The question states that there is a difference between the starting material and product, so this would support the mechanism where such a configuration change occurs via the proposed elimination-addition pathway.

Alternatively, another piece of evidence could be the presence of a double bond intermediate (maybe observed via spectroscopy), but the answer given is about optical rotation. So perhaps during the elimination-addition, there is an inversion or a change in configuration at a carbon, leading to a different enantiomer.

Wait, let me think of the stereochemistry here. Let's consider the beta carbon of the alanine. Suppose the azido group is on the beta carbon, and during the elimination step, when the double bond forms between alpha and beta carbons, the configuration around the beta carbon might be altered. Alternatively, perhaps the formation of the double bond leads to a loss of a chiral center? Or maybe the addition of the nucleophile in the Michael addition leads to a new chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step removes a chiral center (the beta carbon) by forming a double bond, which is achiral, but then the Michael addition could lead to a new chiral center? Or maybe the original beta carbon was chiral because of the azido group? Wait, the original alanine with the azido on beta carbon would have a chiral center there?

Yes! Wait a second. Let me think again. If the azido group is on the beta carbon of the alanine, then that carbon (the beta carbon) now has four different substituents: the alpha carbon (connected to the rest of the peptide), the double bond (if formed), the azido group, and another group. Wait, actually, the beta carbon in the alanine (before elimination) must have four different substituents? Let's see:

Original structure: the alanine has an azido group on the beta carbon, so the beta carbon is connected to the alpha carbon (which is part of the peptide chain), the azido group, a hydrogen, and maybe another substituent. Wait, let's break it down.

If the alanine's beta carbon is the one adjacent to the alpha carbon, then in the amino acid context, the alpha carbon is connected to the amino and carboxyl groups (or in the dipeptide, to the Phe and the OMe?), so the beta carbon would have the following groups:

Alpha carbon (connected to the rest of the peptide), a hydrogen, and the side chain? Wait, alanine's side chain is just a methyl group on the alpha carbon, so the beta carbon (next in the chain?) is actually part of the main chain. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering for the side chain is different. Let me consider that the 3-N3 refers to the position on the side chain of the alanine. But since alanine's side chain is a methyl group, that would be only one carbon. So maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the alanine is modified such that the azido group is attached to the third carbon in some numbering system.

Wait, maybe this is a trick question where the formation of a double bond leads to a change in the configuration. For instance, in a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the nucleophile can add to either face of the double bond, leading to different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, the key point is that if a chiral center is involved in the elimination and addition steps, the stereochemistry at that center might be inverted or altered, leading to a change in optical rotation.

Alternatively, if the original dipeptide has a certain configuration at the beta carbon (due to the azido group), and after the reaction, that configuration is changed (because the azido is replaced by the nucleophile), then the optical rotation would change.

Wait, but how does replacing the azido group with the nucleophile affect the configuration? If the azido was in a specific stereochemical orientation, then the nucleophile might add in a different orientation, leading to inversion or retention. But to have a change in optical rotation, the enantiomer or a diastereomer must be formed.

Alternatively, the starting material has a certain configuration (e.g., R or S) at the beta carbon, and the product has the opposite configuration (S or R) due to the inversion during the elimination-addition process. Since optical rotation is dependent on the absolute configuration, this would result in an opposite rotation, thus providing evidence for the mechanism.

Alternatively, if the elimination leads to loss of a chiral center and then the addition creates a new one, the overall configuration might differ. However, the strongest evidence would be the optical rotation change, as it directly indicates a stereochemical change which is explained by the proposed mechanism involving a conjugate addition where the nucleophile approaches from a particular face.

Alternatively, another possible evidence could be the detection of the double bond via IR or NMR, but the question is about the strongest evidence for the mechanism. Since the mechanism involves a change in the stereochemistry (due to the conjugate addition, which can lead to inversion or a different configuration), the optical rotation being different is strong evidence for that.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose that in the elimination step, the azido group is removed, forming a double bond between alpha and beta carbons. The nucleophile then attacks the double bond. If this is a nucleophilic addition, the Michael addition would proceed with the nucleophile attacking from a specific face, leading to a specific stereochemistry. If the original beta carbon had a certain configuration (as a chiral center because of the azido group), then after elimination and addition, that configuration might be reversed, leading to a change in optical rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original beta carbon wasn't chiral, but the azido group made it chiral, and upon replacement, it becomes a different configuration. Wait, but the azido group is on the beta carbon, so if that beta carbon is chiral, then replacing the azido with another group (the nucleophile) would change the substituents, so the configuration would depend on how the nucleophile adds.

Alternatively, the elimination step might remove the chiral center (by forming a double bond, making it non-chiral), but the subsequent addition could form a new chiral center. However, the starting material had a chiral center there (due to the azido group), and the product might now have a different one, leading to a different optical rotation.

Alternatively, if the elimination-addition proceeds through an achiral intermediate (the double bond), but the addition can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture, but if the reaction is stereoselective, then the product would have a specific configuration different from the starting material. Since the question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, the product has the nucleophile attached to the beta carbon. If that addition leads to a different configuration than the original azido group's configuration, then the optical rotation would change.

Therefore, the presence of a difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product indicates that there was a change in the configuration at that carbon, which is exactly what the proposed mechanism (with a conjugate addition) would predict. If the reaction had proceeded via a different mechanism without such stereochemistry change, the optical rotation might remain the same or change less significantly.

Other possible evidence might include the detection of the double bond intermediate (but that's more about the pathway), or the identification of the nucleophile's addition at a specific position. But optical rotation being different is a strong indicator of a stereochemical change, which the proposed mechanism necessitates.

Another possible line of thought: In a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the double bond formed in the elimination. The addition can occur with either syn or anti addition, but more importantly, the stereochemistry at the original chiral center (if any) might change. Since the starting material has a specific configuration (given that it's a natural amino acid, so L-configuration), replacing a group on a chiral carbon would lead to a different configuration, hence a change in optical rotation.

Therefore, the strongest evidence is that the optical rotation changes, showing that the stereochemistry at that center has altered, which aligns with the proposed mechanism involving a conjugate addition step where the nucleophile approaches a specific face of the double bond, leading to inversion or a different configuration.
</think>

The strongest evidence supporting the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **the difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's why:

### Key Reasoning:
1. **Stereochemical Change in Mechanism**:
   - The azido group on the β-carbon of the alanine residue creates a **chiral center**. During β-elimination, this group is eliminated, forming a double bond between the α- and β-carbons of the alanine. 
   - In the subsequent **Michael addition**, the nucleophile attacks the conjugated double bond. This addition can occur with stereoselectivity, leading to a **change in configuration** at the original β-carbon (now part of the double bond). 
   - If the nucleophile adds to a specific face of the double bond, the resulting carbon (now reconnected via the nucleophile) may adopt a different configuration (e.g., inversion or retention), altering the molecule’s stereochemistry.

2. **Optical Rotation as a Stereochemical Indicator**:
   - Optical rotation is directly tied to the **absolute configuration** of chiral centers. A change in optical activity between the starting material and product indicates a **stereochemical change** at a chiral center. 
   - For the proposed mechanism, the elimination and addition steps must disrupt the original configuration of the β-carbon (due to the azido group’s removal and the nucleophile’s addition). This disruption would result in a different optical rotation compared to the starting dipeptide.

3. **Elimination of Alternative Mechanisms**:
   - If the reaction occurred via a simple nucleophilic substitution (e.g., SN2), the optical rotation might remain unchanged (if inversion occurred at a single chiral center) or show predictable changes. However, a β-elimination followed by Michael addition inherently involves a **conjugate addition step**, which can lead to more complex stereochemical outcomes, such as the formation of new chiral centers or inversion at existing ones. The observed change in optical rotation strongly supports this pathway.

### Why Other Evidences Are Less Direct:
- **Intermediate Detection (e.g., double bond via spectroscopy)**: While identifying the conjugated double bond (via IR or NMR) would support the mechanism, it does not directly confirm the stereochemical changes required for the Michael addition step.
- **Product Structure Identification**: Confirming the nucleophile’s attachment to the β-carbon is necessary but does not explicitly demonstrate the stereochemical inversion required by the mechanism. Optical rotation provides direct evidence of stereochemical alteration.

### Conclusion:
The **change in optical rotation** unequivocally indicates a **stereochemical change** at a chiral center during the reaction, which is a hallmark of the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism. This provides the strongest evidence for the proposed pathway. 

**Correct Answer**: There is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that there's a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Let me start by recalling what the question is about. 

The problem involves a protected dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Phe is phenylalanine, and Ala(3-N3) is alanine with an azide group on the third carbon (which, for alanine, would be the β-carbon since alanine has a two-carbon chain? Wait, alanine's structure is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH. So the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups, and the β-carbon is the CH3. Wait, but maybe in the context of dipeptides, the numbering might be different. Hmm, maybe the 3-N3 is on the third carbon when considering the side chain? Wait, alanine's side chain is just CH3, so maybe the azide is on the β-carbon? Because the α is the one connected to the backbone. So the 3-azido would be on the β-carbon. 

The reaction occurs when they treat it with a nucleophilic base. The azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base, forming a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by Michael addition. The question is asking which evidence supports this mechanism, and the answer is the difference in optical rotation. 

First, let me think about the possible steps. β-elimination would involve the loss of a leaving group or a base removing a proton adjacent to the β-carbon? Maybe forming a double bond? Wait, β-elimination usually refers to the loss of a proton and a leaving group from the β-carbon, leading to a double bond. Like in an E2 elimination. Then a Michael addition would involve the attack of a nucleophile on an electrophilic carbon conjugated to a carbonyl. 

So let's try to visualize the dipeptide structure. The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Boc is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group on the N-terminus. The Phe is the first amino acid, then Ala with the azide on the β-carbon (since Ala has two carbons in the side chain? Wait, no, alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, so maybe the β here refers to the carbon adjacent to the α, which is the β-carbon of the amino acid. So the azide is attached to the β-carbon of the alanine. 

So the structure would be: Boc (on the N-terminus of Phe), then the Phe, then the Ala, with the azide on the β-carbon. The OMe is the O-methyl ester at the C-terminus. 

When treated with a nucleophilic base, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let's break this down. 

In β-elimination, perhaps the nucleophilic base abstracts a proton adjacent to the β-carbon (so maybe the α-proton of the alanine?), leading to the loss of the azide as a leaving group (but azide is a poor leaving group, so maybe something else happens). Wait, maybe the β-elimination here would involve the deprotonation at a β-carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond, and the azide is eliminated as a leaving group? Maybe as azide anion? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a carbon-carbon double bond, making the molecule more conjugated, which then allows a Michael addition. 

Alternatively, the β-elimination could remove the azide group via a base, forming a double bond between the β-carbon and the adjacent carbon (like the α-carbon of the alanine?), creating a conjugated system. Then the nucleophile (the base?) can perform a Michael addition onto the conjugated double bond. The Michael addition typically involves the attack of a nucleophile (like a carbanion) on an electron-deficient carbon conjugated to a carbonyl. 

Wait, in this case, perhaps after elimination, the resulting structure has a double bond that's conjugated to the Phe residue's aromatic ring or maybe the ester group? Not sure. But following elimination and addition, the nucleophile would form a new bond on the β-carbon. 

Now, the key point here is that the reaction involves a rearrangement where the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, but the mechanism involves a β-elimination and Michael addition. 

The question is about the evidence for this mechanism. The answer given is the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and product. 

Optical rotation is related to the molecule's chirality. So if the product has different optical rotation, that would mean there's a change in configuration at a chiral center. 

In the original dipeptide, the Ala(3-N3) has a chiral center at the β-carbon (since it's substituted with H, CH2CH(NH2)COOH (the rest of the alanine?), azide, and the adjacent carbon). Wait, alanine normally has only one chiral center at the α-carbon. Wait, but if the 3-azido is on the β-carbon, then the β-carbon would have four different groups? Let's see: the β-carbon of alanine would be the CH3 in regular alanine, but if it's 3-azido, then maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the α-carbon is the one connected to the amino group, so the β is the next one. 

Let me think again: the amino acid sequence is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the alanine here is 3-azido-L-alanine. The standard alanine has the structure: the α-carbon (connected to NH2, COOH, and the side chain CH3, plus the next carbon in the peptide chain). The 3-azido would be on the β-carbon. So the β-carbon would have the following groups: attached to the α-carbon (connected to the rest of the peptide), the azide, a hydrogen, and another carbon? Wait, maybe the 3-azido refers to the carbon in the side chain? 

Wait, perhaps the 3-N3 is on the third carbon of the alanine side chain. But alanine only has a methyl group (one carbon) side chain, so that can't be. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's a different numbering. Alternatively, maybe in the context of the dipeptide, the numbering starts from the C-terminus? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 3-N3 is referring to the position in the entire dipeptide chain? 

Alternatively, maybe "3-N3" means that the azide is attached to the third carbon in the alanine side chain, but since alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the methyl group), that would not be possible. So maybe the numbering is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the β-carbon (the second carbon in the amino acid chain, starting from the α-carbon) has the azido group. Since the α-carbon is the central chiral center (for the L-amino acid), the β-carbon would be the next carbon in the chain. For alanine, which is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH, the β-carbon is the CH3 (the side chain). Wait, but that's only one carbon. So the β-carbon here is the CH3. But if the azide is attached there, that would replace the methyl group? Wait no, because the side chain of alanine is CH3, so if the 3-N3 is on the β-carbon (the CH3), then the β-carbon would have a CH2- group instead of CH3? Maybe it's a different structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to L-alanine with an azide group at the beta position, so in the structure: the amino group is on the alpha carbon, the carboxylic acid is on the other side, and the beta carbon is branched with a methyl group and an azido group? Wait, but then that would make the beta carbon chiral. 

Ah, yes! If the beta carbon has the azide group attached, then the beta carbon would have four different substituents: the alpha carbon, the gamma carbon (which in alanine would be a methyl?), wait, maybe in this case, the substitution makes the beta carbon chiral. 

Wait, let me think again. Let's take L-alanine. Its structure is: 

NH2-CH(CH3)-COOH 

The alpha carbon (the central one) is the chiral center. The beta carbon is the CH3 group, which is not a chiral center because it's only attached to the alpha carbon and three hydrogens. 

But if you add an azido group to the beta carbon (the CH2? Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, maybe it's L-alanine with an extra carbon in the side chain? Like perhaps a three-carbon side chain? Wait, no, alanine's side chain is one carbon. 

Wait, maybe the question uses "3-N3" as the position in the dipeptide? Like the third carbon in the dipeptide chain? Probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe "Ala(3-N3)" indicates that the azide is attached to the third carbon in the alanine residue. Since alanine is a tripeptide? No, alanine is one residue. Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the alpha carbon is 1, the beta is 2, so the azide is on carbon 3? That would require an extra carbon. Maybe in the context of the dipeptide, the numbering starts from the N-terminus. 

Hmm, maybe this is getting too bogged down. Let's try to think of possible reasons why optical rotation change is the best evidence. 

In a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, there might be a change in configuration at a chiral center. For instance, if the β-elimination creates a new double bond and then the Michael addition occurs with a specific stereochemistry, that could invert or retain configuration at certain centers, leading to a different enantiomer or diastereomer. 

Alternatively, perhaps during the elimination and addition steps, the nucleophile attacks from a specific face of the Michael acceptor, leading to a change in the configuration at a chiral center. 

Alternatively, the original dipeptide has a certain configuration at the β-carbon (if that carbon became chiral during the reaction). For example, if the β-elimination step creates a new double bond adjacent to a chiral center, which then leads to a new chiral center during the addition. 

Alternatively, the original alanine's β-carbon might not have been chiral, but after the reaction, a new chiral center could form. For instance, if the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, and the β-carbon now has four different substituents, making it a new chiral center. 

Wait, let's think about the original structure. The Ala(3-N3) has an azide on the beta carbon. Let's assume the beta carbon is the one adjacent to the alpha, so that the beta carbon in alanine would be the CH2 (if there's an extra carbon). Wait, maybe the structure is modified. Let me try to draw it mentally. 

Suppose the protected dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala-OMe, where the Ala has an azido group at position 3. Let's say that the Ala here is not the regular alanine but has an extended side chain? For example, perhaps it's a modified alanine where the side chain is a propyl group with the azido on the third carbon. Wait, but then it would be a different amino acid. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the alpha is 1, beta is 2, and the azido is on carbon 3, which is part of the side chain. For example, maybe the side chain is a propyl group with the azido on the third carbon. But that would be a different amino acid, like norleucine or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the azido is on the gamma carbon, making it a four-carbon side chain? Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think more about the reaction mechanism. 

The key is that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. The β-elimination would remove the azido group, perhaps forming a double bond. Let's think of the azide as being on the beta carbon. If the beta carbon has the azide, then during β-elimination, maybe the azide leaves as a leaving group (but azide is a poor leaving group; maybe it's deprotonated first?), accompanied by the removal of a proton from the adjacent carbon (the alpha?), forming a double bond between beta and gamma? 

Wait, perhaps the elimination step is similar to an E2 mechanism where the base abstracts a proton from the beta carbon, leading to the expulsion of the azide as a leaving group. Wait, but the azide is on the beta carbon, so maybe the base removes a proton from the alpha carbon adjacent to the azide (the beta carbon). Wait, the geometry might be such that the beta carbon and alpha (from the alanine) are adjacent. 

Alternatively, perhaps the beta elimination leads to the formation of an enolate or an alkene. Let me think of the steps:

1. β-elimination: The azido group on the beta carbon is adjacent to a proton that's abstracted by the base, leading to the formation of a double bond between the beta carbon and the next carbon (maybe the alpha?), and the azide is eliminated as N3^-.

Wait, but azide is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the elimination is of the azide with another group. Hmm, perhaps the beta-elimination leads to the loss of the azide and a proton, forming a double bond between the beta carbon and the adjacent carbon. 

After that, a Michael addition occurs. The Michael addition requires a conjugated double bond. The double bond formed in the elimination would be conjugated with another double bond or a carbonyl group. Then the nucleophile (the base?) attacks the electrophilic carbon in the conjugated system, leading to the formation of a new bond. 

The key point is that the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, replacing the azido group. 

Now, why would optical rotation difference be the best evidence? 

Optical rotation is a measure of the compound's chirality. If during the mechanism, the configuration at a chiral center is inverted or a new chiral center is formed, then the optical rotation would change. 

The original dipeptide has chiral centers at the alpha carbons of both Phe and Ala (since both are L-amino acids). Additionally, if the beta carbon in the alanine becomes chiral due to the reaction, then the product would have an additional chiral center, or maybe the configuration at an existing chiral center has changed. 

Alternatively, if during the elimination and addition steps, there's a change in configuration at one of the existing chiral centers. For example, the Michael addition might proceed with a specific stereochemistry, leading to a change in the configuration at the beta carbon or another center. 

Wait, let's think again. Let's suppose the starting material has a certain number of chiral centers and specific configurations. After the reaction, if a new chiral center is formed (e.g., the beta carbon that was previously not chiral becomes chiral because it now has four different substituents after the azido is replaced by the nucleophile), then the product would have a different number of chiral centers, leading to a different optical rotation. 

Alternatively, maybe the original dipeptide has a chiral center at the beta carbon (due to the azido group). Let's see: if the beta carbon in the alanine has the azido group, then maybe it has four different groups? Let me see: the beta carbon in alanine is normally the CH3, but if it's substituted with an azido group instead, then maybe the structure is something like: the beta carbon (originally CH3) is now CH2N3, so it has two hydrogens, an azido group, and a bond to the alpha carbon. Wait, but then that would still have three H's and an azide, so it's not chiral. Wait, unless there's another substituent. 

Alternatively, perhaps the alpha carbon (the central chiral center of the alanine) remains, but during the reaction, the configuration there is inverted. 

Wait, perhaps during the β-elimination and Michael addition, some of the existing chiral centers' configurations are altered. For instance, if the Michael addition occurs with a specific stereochemistry, like from a particular face of the Michael acceptor, causing inversion or retention of configuration. 

Alternatively, if the elimination step leads to a double bond that is in a trans or cis configuration, affecting the overall conformation, but that might not directly relate to optical rotation unless it creates a new chiral center. 

Alternatively, if the dipeptide's original amino acids are in L-configuration, but the reaction might lead to a D-configuration at a specific center, changing the optical rotation's sign. 

Alternatively, the key point is that the β-elimination/Michael addition involves a rearrangement that changes the connectivity of the molecule in such a way that a chiral center is either created or its configuration is inverted. 

The optical rotation is directly related to the presence and configuration of chiral centers. If the starting material and product have different chiral centers or different configurations at existing centers, their optical rotations would be different. 

Therefore, if the proposed mechanism involves a change in configuration or creation of a new chiral center, the difference in optical rotation would be strong evidence for that mechanism. 

Other possible evidence might include NMR data showing new peaks due to different groups or configurations, or the presence of a new functional group, but the question asks for the strongest evidence related to the mechanism (β-elimination followed by Michael addition). 

The optical rotation difference would be particularly telling because it indicates a change in stereochemistry, which is crucial in such a mechanism where bond-making and bond-breaking involve chiral centers. 

Alternatively, if the reaction were just a simple substitution without any rearrangement (like a nucleophilic substitution), there might not be a change in optical rotation (if the configuration remains the same). But since it's a β-elimination followed by addition, there might be a change in the configuration, hence the rotation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that the optical rotation difference is the strongest evidence, as it indicates a change in the molecule's stereochemistry, which aligns with the proposed mechanism involving a rearrangement through elimination and addition steps that alter the chiral centers.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in this reaction is **the difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's why:

### Key Reasoning:
1. **Chiral Centers and Optical Rotation**:  
   Optical rotation is directly tied to the stereochemistry of a molecule, reflecting the presence and configuration of chiral centers. A change in optical rotation implies a change in the molecule's stereochemistry—inversion of configuration at an existing chiral center, formation of a new chiral center, or a shift in the overall conformation that affects chirality.

2. **Mechanism Involving Stereochemical Changes**:  
   - **β-Elimination**: This step likely involves the removal of the azide group (via deprotonation and elimination) and the formation of a double bond. This could alter the electronic environment or create new stereogenic centers.  
   - **Michael Addition**: The nucleophile attacks a conjugated electrophilic carbon. Depending on the stereochemistry of the addition (e.g., syn or anti), this could invert configuration at an existing chiral center or introduce a new chiral center.  

3. **Impact on Chiral Centers**:  
   - The starting dipeptide contains chiral centers at the α-carbons of both phenylalanine and alanine (since they are L-amino acids).  
   - During the elimination and addition steps, the β-carbon of alanine (originally substituted with an azido group) may transition from a non-chiral to a chiral center (e.g., if the azido group is replaced by a nucleophile, creating four unique substituents). Alternatively, the stereochemistry at an existing chiral center (e.g., the α-carbon) could invert due to the reaction pathway.  

4. **Elimination of Alternative Mechanisms**:  
   A simple nucleophilic substitution (without elimination/addition) would not alter the number or configuration of chiral centers significantly, leaving optical rotation unchanged. In contrast, a β-elimination/Michael addition mechanism inherently involves structural rearrangements that disrupt or alter stereochemistry, leading to a measurable change in optical rotation.  

### Conclusion:
The difference in optical rotation directly indicates a stereochemical change during the reaction, which is a hallmark of the proposed β-elimination/Michael addition mechanism. This evidence is stronger than other types (e.g., NMR peaks or functional group analysis) because it specifically addresses the stereochemical rearrangement central to the mechanism. Thus, **optical rotation change** is the strongest evidence supporting the mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about a peptide chemistry reaction where a protected dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, is treated with a nucleophilic base. The result is that the azido group (which I think is the -N3 part) gets replaced by the nucleophilic base, forming a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. The question is about identifying the strongest evidence that this reaction proceeded via a β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism. The given answer is that there is a difference in the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Let me try to work through why that might be the case.

First, I need to recall what a β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism entails. β-elimination typically involves the removal of a proton from the β-carbon of the amino acid, leading to the formation of an enamine or similar conjugated system. Then, a Michael addition would involve the nucleophilic attack of a carbanion (from the base?) onto an electron-poor carbon, perhaps in a conjugated system. Wait, but in this case, they mentioned the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. So the azido group is leaving, and the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon?

Hmm, maybe the mechanism starts with the azido group acting as a leaving group. But azides are usually pretty good leaving groups, but under what conditions? If a base is present, perhaps the azido group can be deprotonated or something. Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation at the α-carbon (since β-elimination usually involves the α and β carbons?), forming a carbanion, which then undergoes β-elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated system. Then, the nucleophile (the base?) can perform a Michael addition to the β,γ-unsaturated system?

Wait, the dipeptide structure here is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The protected groups: Boc is the N-terminal protecting group (tert-butyloxycarbonyl), OMe is the C-terminal methyl ester. The Ala here is substituted at the 3-position (the β-carbon of the alanine?) with an azido group. So the azido is attached to the side chain of alanine. Since alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, but here it's modified to have an azido at the 3rd carbon? Wait, maybe I need to think about the structure of 3-azido-L-alanine.

Alanine's structure is CH3CH(NH2)COOH. The α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups, right? So the β-carbon would be the methyl group's carbon. But wait, in terms of numbering, the α is adjacent to the carboxylic acid. So maybe the side chain is considered the β carbon? Hmm, perhaps the azido group is attached to the third carbon? Wait, maybe the numbering is different here. Let me think again. In amino acid numbering, the α-carbon is the one bonded to both the amino and carboxylic acid groups. Then the side chain carbons are numbered starting from the α. For alanine, since its side chain is just a methyl group, the β-carbon is the methyl carbon. But if it's 3-azido-L-alanine, that might imply that there's another carbon in the side chain? Wait, maybe I'm confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is attached to the α-carbon? But no, that would interfere with the peptide bond. Wait, maybe the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, so the Ala has an azido group on its 3rd carbon. Since alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the methyl group), maybe the numbering here refers to the position in the peptide chain? Wait, perhaps the 3-N3 is on the third carbon of the alanine residue, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the azido is on the β-carbon of the amino acid? Hmm. Maybe I need to think of the structure of the dipeptide.

Alternatively, maybe the key here isn't the exact structure but the mechanism. The question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base forming a bond with the β-carbon. So the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me recall those steps.

In a β-elimination reaction, a proton is removed from the β-carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. So perhaps the azido group is adjacent to the β-carbon, so when it leaves, an elimination occurs, forming an enamine or enone, which is conjugated. Then, a Michael addition would be the addition of a nucleophile to the β-position (relative to the double bond?) of this conjugated system. So the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the conjugated system, which might correspond to the γ-carbon of the original amino acid? Hmm, maybe the exact positions are not critical here. 

The key point is the mechanism involves a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The evidence for this mechanism would be something that indicates the presence of a conjugated system (like a double bond) at some point, or the formation of a specific stereochemical outcome, or perhaps an inversion or retention of configuration that can be tracked via optical rotation.

The given answer is that there's a difference in optical rotation between the starting material and product. Optical rotation is a measure of chirality, so if the mechanism involves some stereocenter changing configuration, that would change the optical rotation. Alternatively, if the mechanism leads to a change in the stereochemistry of an existing chiral center or the creation of a new one, that would explain the difference.

In a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon might be altered. For instance, during the β-elimination, the double bond forms, and if there are chiral centers nearby, the elimination could lead to the formation of an enantiomer or diastereomer. Then the Michael addition, being stereospecific, might proceed with a specific stereochemical outcome. Alternatively, if the elimination leads to a planar intermediate or transition state, the addition could lead to a change in configuration.

Wait, the β-elimination step would remove a proton and a leaving group (maybe the azide?) but actually, the azido group is being replaced. Hmm, maybe the elimination is not of the azido but another group? Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is leaving first, then elimination occurs?

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is: the base abstracts a proton from the α-carbon adjacent to the azido group, leading to the formation of a carbanion. Then, the azido group leaves as a leaving group (but azide is not a great leaving group, but maybe under basic conditions?), forming a double bond between α and β carbons (i.e., β-elimination). This creates an enone or similar conjugated system. The nucleophile (the base?) then attacks in a Michael addition, adding to the β-carbon (relative to the double bond?), leading to the displacement of the azide and formation of a new bond. 

In this case, during the β-elimination, the chiral center (if there was one adjacent) might undergo inversion or retention. Let's think of the starting material: the protected dipeptide has Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Let's consider the Phe and Ala residues.

Phenylalanine (Phe) has a phenyl group on its side chain, which is a chiral center. Alanine(3-N3) – if the azido is on the β-carbon, then that position would be part of the alanine's side chain (if applicable), but since alanine's side chain is a methyl group, perhaps the azido is on the α-carbon? Wait, maybe the numbering here is different. Alternatively, perhaps the 3-N3 refers to the third carbon in the peptide chain or something else. Maybe the key is that the azido group is on a chiral center. If the azido group is part of a chiral center, then its removal and subsequent addition of the nucleophile could change the configuration, thereby altering the optical rotation.

Alternatively, the β-elimination step might involve a double bond formation that affects the conformation, but optical rotation is more about absolute configuration. Let me think step by step.

Suppose the starting material has a certain absolute configuration at a particular chiral center. If during the elimination and addition steps, the configuration at that center is inverted or altered, the optical rotation would change.

In a β-elimination, such as in an E2 mechanism, the base abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. The stereochemistry of the double bond (cis/trans) depends on the relative positions of the groups. If this elimination occurs at a chiral center, perhaps the elimination leads to a change in the configuration of that center. Wait, actually, in an E2 reaction, the leaving group and the abstracted proton must be anti-periplanar, which can lead to inversion of configuration at the leaving group's position. Hmm, maybe not directly affecting the chiral center's configuration unless the chiral center is involved in the elimination.

Alternatively, the Michael addition is a stereoselective reaction. The conjugated system formed after elimination would have a certain configuration, and the nucleophile attacks either the top or bottom face, leading to a specific stereochemistry. If the addition is stereospecific, then the product would have a different configuration than the starting material, leading to a change in optical rotation.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a specific enantiomer, and the product is another, hence the rotation changes sign or magnitude. Since optical rotation is specific to the enantiomer, if the mechanism leads to racemization or inversion, then the observed rotation would differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure has a certain configuration at the β-carbon of the alanine, and after elimination and addition, the configuration at that carbon or another chiral center is inverted, thereby changing the overall optical rotation.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination step creates a new chiral center? Let's see. Suppose the β-elimination removes the azido group (as a leaving group) along with a proton, forming a double bond. If the original group was part of a chiral center, then removing it would affect the configuration. Wait, the azido is on Ala's 3-N3. If the alanine's side chain (which is normally a methyl group) has an azido at the 3-position, that would mean the side chain is extended? Wait, perhaps I need to draw this out mentally.

Wait, alanine's structure is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH. The side chain is the methyl group (CH3) attached to the α-carbon. If the azido is at the 3 position, perhaps that's an added carbon? Wait, maybe the numbering is different here. In amino acids, the α is the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group, then the side chain is the β-carbon. But Alanine's side chain is just one carbon. So a 3-azido would imply that there is another carbon in the side chain? Wait, maybe 3-N3 is a typo, or perhaps it's the position in the dipeptide? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 3 refers to the position in the Alanine residue. Wait, maybe the azido is on the gamma-carbon? I'm getting confused here. Maybe this is a red herring. Let me refocus.

The key point is that the azido is replaced by the nucleophile on the β-carbon of the amino acid. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. The question is about identifying the strongest evidence for this mechanism, and the answer is the difference in optical rotation.

Another possible evidence might be the formation of a double bond (UV spectroscopy showing conjugation), but the question is about the strongest evidence. Alternatively, maybe the stereochemistry of the product, as optical rotation is a measure of chirality, so a change there would indicate a change in configuration, which a β-elimination-Michael addition could cause.

In a β-elimination, if the leaving group is adjacent to a chiral center, the elimination could lead to inversion or retention of configuration. But more importantly, the Michael addition step is stereospecific. The Michael addition is typically stereoselective because the conjugated system has a certain geometry (like a trans double bond?), so the nucleophile would add from one face, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

Suppose the starting material has a certain configuration at the β-carbon (since the azido is attached there). When the azido leaves (via elimination), forming a double bond, then the Michael addition would add the nucleophile to a specific face, leading to inversion or retention of configuration at that carbon. This would result in a change in the optical rotation, as the absolute configuration of the product is different from the starting material.

Alternatively, if the starting material is prochiral (has a chiral center that becomes chiral during the reaction), then the Michael addition would create a new chiral center with a specific configuration, leading to a different optical rotation.

Wait, in the starting material, the alanine with the azido group might have a chiral center at the β position? Because the azido is attached there? For example, if the azido is on the β-carbon (the side chain's carbon), then that carbon (the side chain) is part of a chiral center in the alanine residue. Since alanine's side chain is a methyl group in natural alanine, but here it's substituted with an azido group on the β position, that would make that carbon chiral? Wait, if the side chain is a methyl group (CH3) in normal alanine, substituting one of the hydrogens with azido (N3) would make that carbon chiral (since it would have four different substituents: the α-carbon, the azido, two other hydrogens?), so yes, that would create a new chiral center. So the starting material's alanine residue has a chiral center at the β position (the side chain carbon) because of the azido substitution.

If the β-elimination-eliminates the azido group and a proton (from the adjacent carbon?), forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. Then, the Michael addition would add the nucleophile to the β position (the former site of the azido group?), but in a way that changes the configuration. Since the double bond's geometry would determine the approach of the nucleophile, leading to a specific stereochemistry. This would change the configuration at that carbon, thereby altering the optical rotation. 

Therefore, if the starting material had a certain configuration (say R or S) at that chiral center, the product would have the opposite configuration (S or R), leading to a different optical rotation. Since optical rotation is dependent on the absolute configuration, even if the magnitude is the same but the sign is opposite, or if the magnitude changes due to different interactions. The difference in optical rotation would be evidence that the configuration has changed, which aligns with the mechanism involving elimination and addition steps that can invert or alter the configuration. 

Other evidence could include NMR showing formation of a double bond (conjugated system), but the optical rotation difference is more directly related to the mechanism's stereoselectivity. Alternatively, if there's a change in the specific rotation (like [α] value) between starting material and product, that would indicate a change in the molecule's chirality, which is exactly what a stereochemical change due to elimination and addition would cause. Therefore, the answer makes sense because the change in optical rotation is a direct indicator of a change in the molecule's stereochemistry, supporting the proposed mechanism that involves such a change.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in this reaction is **the difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's why:

### Key Mechanistic Steps:
1. **β-Elimination**: 
   - The azido group (N₃) departs as a leaving group (or is replaced), accompanied by deprotonation of the α-carbon. This forms a conjugated α,β-unsaturated system (e.g., an enone or enamine) through the elimination step.
   - If the β-carbon of the alanine residue was part of a chiral center (due to the azido substitution), its configuration could be altered during this step. For example, abstraction of a proton adjacent to the azido group might lead to inversion of configuration at the β-carbon.

2. **Michael Addition**:
   - The nucleophilic base attacks the β-carbon of the conjugated system (now in a planar, electrophilic region due to conjugation). This step is stereospecific, meaning the nucleophile adds to a specific face of the conjugated molecule.
   - This addition could invert or retain the configuration at the β-carbon, depending on the geometry of the conjugated system (e.g., *trans*-double bond favoring addition from one face).

### Why Optical Rotation Changes:
- **Chiral Center Alteration**: 
  - The starting material (Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N₃)-OMe) contains a chiral center at the β-carbon of the 3-azido-alanine residue. The azido substitution creates a stereocenter here (four different substituents: the α-carbon, azido group, and two hydrogens).
  - During β-elimination and Michael addition, the configuration at this chiral center (or another affected by the reaction) is altered. This change in stereochemistry directly affects the molecule’s optical rotation because the optical rotation is sensitive to the molecule’s absolute configuration.
  
- **Racemization vs. Configuration Change**:
  - Even if the overall molecule retains its chirality, a change in the configuration of one or more stereocenters (e.g., inversion at the β-carbon) would result in a different enantiomer or diastereomer. This would manifest as a change in the optical rotation’s magnitude (and possibly sign).

### Why Other Evidence is Less Direct:
- **Formation of a Conjugated System**: While UV spectroscopy might show conjugation (e.g., a π-π* transition), this is indirect and could arise from other mechanisms.
- **NMR Changes**: Chemical shifts or coupling constants could indicate new bonds or double bonds, but they are less directly tied to the mechanism’s stereochemical outcome compared to optical rotation.

### Conclusion:
The difference in optical rotation is the most direct evidence because it unequivocally demonstrates a change in stereochemistry, which is a hallmark of the β-elimination/Michael addition mechanism. This mechanism involves stereospecific steps that alter configurations at chiral centers, leading to a measurable change in the product’s optical activity. 

**Answer**: There is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about a reaction mechanism involving a dipeptide, Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The reaction uses a nucleophilic base, and the azido group (N3) is replaced by the nucleophile. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The question asks which evidence would strongly support this mechanism, and the given answer is that there's a difference in the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.

Hmm, first, I need to recall what β-elimination and Michael addition steps involve. β-elimination usually refers to removing a proton from a carbon two positions away from the leaving group, forming a double bond. In this case, maybe the azido group is leaving, and then the base attacks in a Michael addition? Wait, Michael addition is typically a conjugate addition to an activated double bond, like a Michael donor adding to a Michael acceptor. 

Let me think about the structure of the dipeptide. The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Boc group is a protecting group for the α-amino group of the first amino acid (Phe), and the OMe is the ester protecting the carboxylic acid end, maybe of the second amino acid (Ala). The Ala here is 3-azido-L-alanine, so the azido group is attached to the beta carbon (position 3) of the alanine residue. 

So the reaction is with a nucleophilic base. The azido group is being replaced by the nucleophile. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me try to visualize the steps.

First, in β-elimination, the azido group (N3) might act as a leaving group. But wait, azides are usually pretty good leaving groups, but maybe under basic conditions, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the azido group. Alternatively, maybe the azide leaves as N2 gas, a common mechanism in azide chemistry, like in Staudinger reactions or when azides are reduced. But here, it's a nucleophilic base, so maybe the azido group is deprotonated first? 

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination involves removing a proton from the β-carbon (the one that has the azido group?), leading to formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons of the alanine. Then, the nucleophilic base would add in a Michael addition step. The Michael addition would involve the nucleophile attacking the α carbon of the double bond, right? 

If that happens, then the configuration at the β-carbon might change. Wait, but in a β-elimination followed by addition, the stereochemistry could change. Let me think about stereochemistry here. 

The starting alanine is L-configuration. Since it's a 3-azido-L-alanine, the chiral center (which is the α-carbon for the alanine) is in the L configuration. The β-carbon (position 3) has the azido group, but that carbon might not be chiral unless there are other substituents. Wait, alanine itself has only two methyl groups (or just a methyl group?), but in this case, maybe the substitution at beta carbon makes it chiral? Let me clarify the structure.

Alanine has the formula CH(CH3)CH(NH2)COOH. But in this case, the 3-N3 would mean that the β-carbon (the carbon next to the α-carbon) has the azido group. Wait, in the alanine residue: the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups, so the β-carbon would be the next one in the side chain. Alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, so the β-carbon here might actually be part of the backbone? Wait, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. In amino acids, the α-carbon is the one bonded to the amino and carboxyl groups. The side chain (R group) for alanine is -CH3, so the β-carbon would be the carbon in the side chain? No, alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the methyl group), so the β position in the side chain would be... actually, since the side chain is only one carbon (the α-carbon's R group is CH3), then maybe the β carbon is part of the main chain? Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the dipeptide structure.

The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the sequence is Phe connected to Ala(3-N3), with the Ala having an azido group at position 3. The "3" in 3-N3 would be the carbon numbering in the alanine residue. In the alanine structure, the α-carbon is the central one connected to the amino and carboxyl. The side chain is a methyl group attached to the α-carbon. So numbering the carbons in the side chain: the α-carbon is position 1, then the side chain (methyl) is position 2? Wait, no, maybe the numbering is different here.

Alternatively, perhaps the "3" refers to the position in the backbone? Wait, in dipeptides, the numbering for the residue might be based on the carbon atoms in the side chain. Hmm, maybe the 3-azido is on the β-carbon of the alanine residue. Since the alanine has only one carbon in its side chain (the α-carbon's side chain is a methyl), perhaps the numbering refers to the main chain? Wait, maybe the 3 position is on the main chain of the dipeptide? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the 3-N3 is on the β-carbon of the previous amino acid? Wait, no, the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, so the Ala(3-N3) is the second amino acid. So the numbering on the Ala must be its own numbering. 

Wait, maybe in the problem statement, the "3-N3" refers to the position in the alanine residue's side chain. But alanine's side chain is a methyl group, so it only has one carbon. Therefore, the 3 might refer to the β-carbon in the alanine's own backbone? Wait, the alanine's backbone is part of the dipeptide chain. Let me think of the backbone: the Phe is connected to the Ala. The Cα of Phe is bonded to the Cα of Ala via a peptide bond. The Ala's β carbon would then be the one adjacent to its own α carbon in the side chain, but since the side chain is a methyl group, that might not be a chiral center. 

Wait, perhaps the numbering in the question refers to the position in the entire dipeptide? Maybe the 3-azido is on the third carbon from the starting point? But without more structural info, maybe it's better to approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that during the mechanism, a change in configuration occurs at a chiral center, leading to an optical rotation difference. The question is about evidence supporting β-elimination and Michael addition. If those steps involve rearrangement or change in stereochemistry, that would result in a change in optical activity. 

So, the starting material is an L-phenylalanine linked to L-alanine with an azido group. If during the reaction, there's a β-elimination (which would form a double bond between α and β carbons), then subsequent Michael addition by the nucleophile, that might result in inversion or retention of configuration at a certain carbon, or perhaps the creation of a new chiral center or change in existing ones.

Wait, the starting dipeptide has chiral centers in both Phe and Ala. The product, after replacing the azido group with the nucleophile, would have a new group on that β carbon. If the mechanism involves formation of a double bond (elimination) followed by addition, then the addition step could proceed with either retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the mechanism. 

But if the elimination step creates a double bond, which then undergoes a conjugate addition (Michael addition), the nucleophile would add to the α carbon of the conjugated enone or similar system. The addition could proceed with either syn or anti addition, but in terms of stereochemistry, if the original chiral centers are affected, their configuration might stay the same or change. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination and addition steps create a new chiral center at the β-carbon where the azido group was. For example, if the azido group leaves as N3-, and through elimination and addition, the new nucleophile bonds in such a way that the configuration at that carbon changes. 

If the original group was in a certain configuration, and after the reaction, the new group is in a different configuration, then the overall optical rotation of the molecule would change. Since optical rotation depends on the configuration of all chiral centers in the molecule, even a change at one center would result in a different specific rotation. 

Therefore, if the product has a different optical rotation, that would indicate a change in configuration at a chiral center, which would support that a rearrangement (like β-elimination followed by addition) occurred, rather than a simple substitution that preserved all configurations. 

In contrast, if the reaction was a simple nucleophilic substitution (SN2), for example, at the β carbon, the stereochemistry might invert, but if there was no change in another chiral center, maybe the overall rotation wouldn't change much? Or maybe not. Wait, but the substitution at the β carbon (which was originally substituted with an azido group) would change the group there, but if it's a substitution (not elimination and addition), perhaps the configuration at that carbon is inverted or retained, but if the carbon was not a chiral center before, maybe it becomes one now? 

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination step creates a double bond that removes a chiral center (if the β carbon was part of a chiral center), changing the molecule's stereochemistry, and then the addition step may or may not restore it. 

Alternatively, if the elimination step forms a double bond between the α and β carbons of the alanine, and the original chiral center (the α-carbon) remains, but the new double bond might affect the overall rotation. Wait, but optical rotation is a bulk property, so changing the structure around a chiral center (like creating a double bond adjacent) could also affect the rotation even without changing the configuration of the chiral center itself. Hmm, but the question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, so the new substituent is on the β carbon. 

Alternatively, perhaps the β elimination leads to the formation of an enamine or some conjugated system, then the Michael addition brings in the nucleophile in a way that creates a new chiral center, leading to a different optical rotation. 

Wait, the key point is that the mechanism involves a rearrangement (elimination and addition steps) which would lead to a change in the configuration at a chiral center. This would result in a different optical rotation because optical rotation is based on all chiral centers. So, if no such rearrangement happened (if it was a direct substitution), maybe the configuration at that carbon is just inverted (SN2) but others remain, so the overall rotation might be similar but opposite? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if the elimination and addition steps proceed through an achiral intermediate (like the double bond), then the addition could lead to a racemic mixture, but if the reaction is stereospecific, perhaps it's non-racemic. Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer (since it's L-phenylalanine and L-alanine), so if the mechanism doesn't involve inversion or creation of a new chiral center in a way that changes the overall rotation, then the product would have the same rotation. 

Therefore, the fact that there's a difference in optical rotation suggests that the stereochemistry at some chiral center has changed. That would support a mechanism where there's a rearrangement (like elimination/addition causing a change in configuration), rather than a simple substitution. 

Other possible evidence might be NMR showing the formation of a double bond (from elimination), or IR showing disappearance of the azido group and appearance of new bonds. But the question specifically asks for the strongest evidence, which is the optical rotation difference. 

Another possibility is that the mechanism involves a change in the number of chiral centers. For example, if the β elimination creates a double bond that removes a chiral center, and then the addition step adds one back but in a different configuration. 

Alternatively, if the starting material has two chiral centers (Phe and Ala), and the product might have a different configuration at one of them. 

Wait, the starting dipeptide has Phe (which is L-phenylalanine, so its α-carbon is in L configuration) and Ala(3-N3), which is L-alanine. The L configuration of the alanine is determined by its α-carbon, which has the NH, COOH, CH3, and the carboxyl group from the next residue. The 3-N3 group is on the β-carbon of the alanine? If that's the case, then the β-carbon wasn't a chiral center before. Adding a nucleophile there would create a new chiral center if the substitution introduces a new group in a way that makes it chiral. 

Wait, the β-carbon (position 3) in the alanine: if it's attached to the azido group, carbon, and maybe two other groups? Let me think: the alanine residue in the dipeptide: the α-carbon is connected to the previous Phe residue via a peptide bond, has an amino group, a carboxyl group (which is part of the peptide bond or ester?), and a side chain methyl group. The β-carbon here is the carbon adjacent to the α-carbon in the side chain? Since the side chain of alanine is just a methyl group, the β-carbon would actually be part of the main chain? Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the "3" refers to the position in the peptide chain. Since it's a dipeptide, the first amino acid is Phe, then Ala. The Ala is the third carbon in the chain? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the β-elimination and Michael addition involve a change in configuration. Since optical rotation depends on the absolute configuration of all chiral centers, any change would lead to a different measured rotation. Therefore, the presence of a difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is the strongest evidence because it suggests a stereochemical change, which is characteristic of a rearrangement mechanism involving elimination and addition steps, rather than a simple substitution. 

Other evidence might be more direct (like detection of N2 gas from azide leaving), but the question is asking for the strongest evidence supporting the mechanism proposed. Since the mechanism involves a change in the bond structure (double bond formation and then addition), which could lead to a different configuration at a chiral center, the optical rotation change is the best indicator. 

Therefore, the correct answer is indeed the difference in optical rotation.
</think>

The strongest evidence supporting the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **the difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Mechanism Overview**: 
   - **β-Elimination**: The azido group (–N₃) leaves, and a proton is abstracted from the β-carbon (adjacent to the α-carbon of the alanine residue), forming a conjugated double bond (C=C).
   - **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic base attacks the α-carbon of the conjugated system, resulting in bond formation at the β-carbon and reconfiguration of the molecule.

2. **Stereochemical Changes**: 
   - The starting dipeptide contains chiral centers in both Phe and the α-carbon of Ala. The β-elimination forms a double bond, potentially altering the spatial arrangement around the α- and β-carbons. 
   - During the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the α-carbon, which may invert or retain stereochemistry at the β-carbon or create a new chiral center. This rearrangement alters the molecule's overall three-dimensional structure.

3. **Optical Rotation as Evidence**: 
   - Optical rotation depends on the absolute configuration of all chiral centers. If the mechanism involves a change in configuration (e.g., inversion at a chiral center or creation of a new one), the product’s optical rotation will differ significantly from the starting material. 
   - A simple substitution (e.g., SN2) might invert configuration at one center but preserve others, potentially resulting in a smaller change in optical rotation. However, the β-elimination/Michael addition pathway inherently involves a more complex rearrangement that likely changes multiple or new stereochemical parameters, leading to a measurable difference in optical activity.

4. **Alternative Evidence**: 
   - Other evidence (e.g., IR spectroscopy showing loss of azido group, NMR showing double bond formation) supports the mechanism but does not directly confirm stereochemical changes. 
   - The optical rotation difference is the strongest evidence because it directly indicates a stereochemical rearrangement, which is a hallmark of the proposed mechanism.

Thus, the observed difference in optical rotation strongly supports the β-elimination–Michael addition pathway, as it confirms a stereochemical change that aligns with the mechanism's steps. 

**Answer**: There is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.
[overthinking]
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the problem is about a reaction involving a protected dipeptide, specifically Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The user treated it with a nucleophilic base, and observed that the azido group (the N3 part) was replaced by the nucleophile, which ended up bonding with the β-carbon of the amino acid. They propose a β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism. The question is asking which evidence best supports that mechanism, and the answer given is that the optical rotation changed between the starting dipeptide and the product. Hmm, why is that?

First, I need to recall what β-elimination-Michael addition entails. I think β-elimination usually means removing a proton from the β-carbon, forming a double bond, right? Like in the E1cB mechanism where a base abstracts a proton, leading to an enolate. Then a Michael addition would involve the conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an activated double bond. So, maybe in this case, the azido group is leaving, and the base first does a β-elimination to form some kind of enamine or enolate, then the nucleophile adds in via Michael addition.

Now, the key here is understanding how the stereochemistry would change. Let me think. The dipeptide has a phenylalanine and a 3-azido alanine. Since Phe and Ala are both chiral centers, but the question is about the β-carbon substitution. Wait, the β-carbon of the amino acid would be the third carbon in the carbon chain? Wait, amino acids are typically numbered as the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxylic acid groups. So the β-carbon would be the next one in the side chain. For alanine, its side chain is only a methyl group, but since this is a 3-azido alanine, maybe the numbering is different? Wait, perhaps in this context, the 3-N3 means the azido group is attached at the third carbon? Wait, alanine's side chain is just a methyl (CH3), so maybe the modification is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe the alanine is modified at the γ-carbon? Because in amino acids, the α is the carbon attached to the amino and carboxyl, then the β, γ, etc., go down the chain. But alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the methyl), so maybe the azido is attached at the β position? Wait, confusion here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says "Ala(3-N3)", so maybe the numbering is as per the standard amino acid nomenclature. In L-alanine, the carbon chain is: the α-carbon (attached to NH2 and COOH), then the β-carbon is the methyl group (CH3). But that's only two carbons. Wait, maybe they are numbering the residues in the dipeptide? Like in the dipeptide, the Phe is the first amino acid, and the Ala is the second. The 3-N3 might refer to the position in the side chain. Alternatively, perhaps in the context of the dipeptide, "3-N3" refers to the third carbon from some position? Maybe in the side chain of alanine?

Wait, perhaps the 3-azido is attached to the third carbon of the alanine side chain? But alanine only has a methyl group as a side chain (the β-carbon). So maybe it's a modified alanine where they've added an extra carbon? Like, perhaps it's not natural alanine but a derivative. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is different here. Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is attached to the β-carbon of the alanine, making it a 3-azidoalanine. Wait, maybe in this case, the β-carbon of the amino acid (alanine's β is the methyl), so the azido is on the β position. So the β-carbon here is the one with the azido group.

The reaction is that the azido is replaced by a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. So first, the base abstracts a proton, leading to an enolate or enamine? Then the nucleophile adds via a Michael addition to that conjugated system?

Now, the question is about the evidence. The options must include things like change in optical rotation, maybe a specific product, maybe the stereochemistry of the product, etc.

The answer given is that there is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between starting dipeptide and product. So why does that support the mechanism?

Optical rotation relates to the molecule's chirality. The starting dipeptide has specific chiral centers (Phe and the azido-Ala). The product, after reaction, would have the azido replaced. But if the mechanism involves a β-elimination (which might lead to a double bond, changing the stereochemistry around the β-carbon?), then when the Michael addition occurs, the addition of the nucleophile could lead to a different configuration of the chiral centers.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination step creates a double bond, which then allows the nucleophile to add in such a way that the stereochemistry is inverted or maintained, leading to a different rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination and addition steps lead to a new chiral center or change the existing ones. Let's think.

Original dipeptide: Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Phe has its own chiral center (the α-carbon of Phe, which is part of the dipeptide structure). The Ala(3-N3) has its own α-carbon (chiral) and maybe the β-carbon (if the azido is there, that would be another chiral center? Wait, if the azido is on the β-carbon (which is the side chain carbon of alanine), then that carbon would have four different groups: the nitrogen (azido), the carbonyl (since it's part of the alanine's side chain?), wait, no. Wait, in alanine's side chain, the β-carbon (the methyl) is only a CH3, but if it's modified with an azido group, then maybe that carbon is now CH2N3, so attached to four different groups: the rest of the alanine, the azido, and maybe other substituents? Hmm, getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3-azido is attached to carbon 3 of the peptide? Wait, maybe in the dipeptide, the numbering is different. Let me try to think step by step.

First, the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Boc group is a protecting group on the N-terminus of Phe, then the Phe is connected to Ala via the peptide bond. The Ala is modified with 3-N3, so probably the azido is on the third carbon of the alanine's side chain. Wait, but natural alanine only has a methyl group as a side chain. Maybe this is a non-natural amino acid where the alanine has an extra carbon? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is based on the entire dipeptide chain?

Alternatively, maybe "3-N3" refers to the carbon in the side chain of alanine. Let me assume that the β-elimination is occurring on the β-carbon (the side chain's carbon) of the alanine. The azido group is on that β-carbon. So when the base attacks, maybe it abstracts a proton from the α-carbon (next to the carbonyl?), leading to a double bond between α and β carbons? Wait, β-elimination would typically remove a proton from the β-carbon, forming a double bond with the α-carbon. Wait, but in amino acids, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups. However, in this case, the azido group is on the β-carbon (the side chain). Wait, maybe the elimination is from the α-carbon? Hmm, perhaps I need to draw a structure.

Let me try to sketch the structure mentally. The dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Boc is the tert-butoxycarbonyl group protecting the N-terminus of Phe. The Phe is linked via a peptide bond to Ala. The Ala has an azido group attached to its β-carbon (since it's 3-N3). The OMe is the ester on the C-terminus.

The reaction is with a nucleophilic base, leading to the azido group being replaced. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. So first, the azido might leave, but wait, the question says the azido is replaced by the nucleophile, so maybe it's a substitution. But the mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. So perhaps the azido group is first eliminated (as part of the β-elimination?) and then the nucleophile adds?

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination occurs first, forming a double bond. Let me think of a typical β-elimination in a peptide. For example, in a peptide's side chain, if there's a proton that can be abstracted from the β-carbon (the one adjacent to the α-carbon), leading to a double bond between α and β. That would form an enamine or enolate structure, which is conjugated. Then the nucleophilic base (acting as a nucleophile?) would do a Michael addition, adding to the conjugated system. The addition would occur at the β-carbon, so the nucleophile would bond there, replacing the azido group?

Wait, but the azido is on the β-carbon. So maybe the elimination step removes the azido group? Or removes a proton from the β-carbon, leading to a double bond, and the azido stays attached but the structure changes. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is a leaving group, but azides are not great leaving groups, so maybe the elimination step is deprotonation leading to an enolate, which then attacks the nucleophile?

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanism is as follows: the base abstracts a proton from the β-carbon adjacent to the azido group, leading to a double bond between the β and γ carbons (assuming that the azido is on the γ?), forming an imine or something. Then the nucleophile adds via a Michael addition to that double bond, replacing the azido group.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination is the removal of a β-hydrogen, forming an enamine. Wait, maybe the structure allows for conjugation. Let's consider the alanine residue. Let's say the alanine has an azido group on the β-carbon. So the side chain would be: α-C (connected to the peptide backbone) -> β-C (with azido, and connected to the rest). If the base abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, that would form an enolate at β. The peptide backbone has a carbonyl group (amide from the peptide bond). Wait, maybe the double bond forms between the α and β carbons, creating a conjugated system with the peptide carbonyl. Then the nucleophile can perform a Michael addition to the β-carbon, adding to that conjugated system.

In this scenario, the Michael addition would lead to the nucleophile attacking the β-carbon, which was previously part of a double bond. The key point is that the addition of the nucleophile would introduce a new chiral center or alter existing ones. Since the starting material has specific chiral centers (Phe's α-C, Ala's α-C, and maybe the β-C with azido if it's chiral?), the product might have different stereochemistry leading to a different optical rotation.

Optical rotation depends on the presence and arrangement of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves a change in the configuration of an existing chiral center or the creation of a new one, that would change the optical rotation. For instance, if during the elimination and addition steps, the β-carbon (which was part of the azido group's chiral center) loses its chiral center or a new chiral center is formed at the β-carbon, the overall rotation would change.

Alternatively, even if the number of chiral centers stays the same, their configurations could flip, leading to a different sign or magnitude of rotation. The magnitude change could be because the rotation is additive from all chiral centers, so changing one's configuration would alter the net rotation.

The other possible evidence might be the formation of a specific product or the presence of a double bond (via IR spectroscopy), but the question states that the correct answer is about optical rotation difference. Since the mechanism involves an elimination and addition that could lead to a change in stereochemistry, that would directly affect the optical rotation. If another mechanism didn't involve such a stereo change, then observing a different rotation would support the proposed mechanism.

For example, if the azido group was simply substituted by the nucleophile in an SN2 reaction (which would invert configuration), but that would only affect that one chiral center. But the β-elimination/Michael addition might involve more complex stereochemical changes. Wait, maybe in the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds with a specific stereochemistry (like syn or anti addition), leading to a different configuration that an SN2 would. Therefore, the change in optical rotation would indicate that the stereochemistry was changed in a way that only the proposed mechanism can account for, rather than a simple substitution.

Alternatively, if the azido was just replaced in a simple substitution without changing other chiral centers, maybe the optical rotation would be similar. But through the elimination and addition, perhaps a new chiral center is formed, or existing ones are altered, so the rotation changes. Since the question says "the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon", the β-carbon might have become a new chiral center, or its existing configuration changed.

Therefore, the presence of a different optical rotation provides evidence that the stereochemistry has been altered in the way the mechanism predicts, which wouldn't happen in a simple substitution. Hence, that's the strongest evidence.
</think>

The strongest evidence supporting a β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **the difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's why:

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mechanism Overview**:  
   The β-elimination step involves deprotonation of the β-carbon (adjacent to the azido group), forming a conjugated enamine or enolate. The nucleophile then undergoes a Michael addition to this conjugated system, attaching to the β-carbon. This process involves changes in the molecule's electronic structure and stereochemistry.

2. **Stereochemical Changes**:  
   - **Original Dipeptide**: The starting material contains chiral centers (e.g., Phe’s α-carbon and the α-carbon of the modified alanine, as well as the β-carbon with the azido group if it forms a quaternary center).  
   - **Mechanism-Induced Changes**:  
     - The β-elimination creates a double bond or enolate, altering the electronic environment.  
     - The Michael addition introduces a new nucleophile to the β-carbon. Depending on the addition’s stereochemistry (e.g., syn or anti), this could invert configurations or create a new chiral center.  
     - These changes disrupt the original stereochemical arrangement, altering the molecule’s overall chiral configuration.

3. **Optical Rotation as Evidence**:  
   Optical rotation is directly tied to the spatial arrangement of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves reconfiguration of existing chiral centers or the creation of new ones, the product’s optical rotation (specific rotation) would differ from the starting material. A simple nucleophilic substitution (SN2) would only invert a single center, whereas the proposed mechanism’s stereochemical complexity (e.g., altering multiple centers or their configurations) leads to a measurable change in optical activity.

### Why Other Evidence Isn’t Stronger:
- **Product Structure**: While observing a specific product (e.g., via mass spectrometry) confirms the reaction occurred, it doesn’t specifically validate the mechanism.  
- **Double Bond Formation**: Evidence of a conjugated system (via IR or UV) could suggest elimination, but it doesn’t confirm the stereochemical changes critical to the Michael addition step.  
- **Nucleophile Identity**: Knowing the nucleophile’s structure doesn’t address how stereochemistry was altered.

### Conclusion:
The **change in optical rotation** is the strongest evidence because it directly reflects the stereochemical rearrangements inherent to β-elimination followed by Michael addition. This mechanism uniquely alters the molecule’s chiral landscape, which a simple substitution would not. Thus, the observed optical rotation difference is definitive proof of the proposed pathway. 

**Answer**: There is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.
[overthinking]
Okay, let's tackle this question about the mechanism of a reaction involving a protected dipeptide. The problem states that treating Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe with a nucleophilic base leads to the azido group being replaced by the nucleophile, and the proposed mechanism is a beta-elimination-Michael addition. We need to figure out which evidence best supports this mechanism, and the answer given is that there's a difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product.

Hmm, first, let me recall what beta-elimination and Michael addition are. Beta-elimination usually involves the removal of a proton and a leaving group from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. A Michael addition is when a nucleophile adds to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to conjugate addition. So if these steps are happening here, the nucleophile might be attacking a double bond that was formed via beta-elimination.

The starting dipeptide has Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) protecting the N-terminus, then Phe (phenylalanine) connected to Ala(3-N3) (which has an azide group on the beta carbon, since Ala's 3rd carbon is the alpha to the carboxyl, so maybe the beta is the one adjacent?), and OMe (methoxy) as the leaving group at the carboxyl end?

Wait, actually, in dipeptides, the structure is usually N-terminal-protecting group - amino acid - amino acid - C-terminal protecting group. Here, the C-terminal is OMe (methoxy ester). The azido is on the 3-position of the alanine, which, in alanine, the alpha carbon is the one attached to the COOH and amino group. The 3-position would be the beta carbon? Since alanine's side chain is just a methyl group, so maybe the numbering is different. Wait, maybe the numbering for amino acids is such that the carboxyl carbon is 1, so the alpha is the next one? Wait, actually, in amino acids, the alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the carboxyl group. So in alanine, the side chain is a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon. But the question says Ala(3-N3). Hmm, maybe the numbering is different here. Alternatively, maybe the azide is on the gamma carbon? Wait, perhaps the dipeptide structure is such that the 3-N3 is on the beta carbon of the alanine. Because if it's Ala(3-N3), then maybe the 3 refers to the position on the side chain? But alanine's side chain is a methyl group, so there is no 3rd carbon. Wait, maybe it's a typo or different numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the azido is on the beta carbon of the alanine's alpha carbon, so the carbon adjacent to the alpha. That would make sense for a beta-elimination. 

So when the base is added, the azide (which is a good leaving group?) is replaced by the nucleophile. The mechanism proposed is beta-elimination followed by Michael addition. Let me think step by step.

First, beta-elimination: the azide group is on the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the alpha carbon of alanine). So the reaction would lose the azide as a leaving group (maybe as N3^-) along with a proton from the alpha carbon (the one connected to the carboxyl), forming a double bond between alpha and beta carbons. Then, the nucleophilic base would add via a Michael addition to the conjugated double bond, attacking the beta carbon (now part of the double bond) and forming a new bond there.

Wait, actually, in a beta-elimination from an amino acid, if the leaving group is on the beta carbon, eliminating a proton from the alpha would form a double bond between alpha and beta. Then, a Michael addition would involve the nucleophile attacking the beta carbon (the one that was originally the gamma?), but perhaps the dipeptide structure is such that the double bond is now between the two carbons, and the Michael addition would add across that? Hmm, maybe I need to draw this out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the beta-elimination occurs in the context of the dipeptide backbone. Wait, the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Ala has an azide on its beta carbon. So the structure is:

Boc-Phe-Ala(azido on 3) - OMe.

The beta-elimination would involve removing the azide from the alanine's beta carbon and a proton from the adjacent alpha carbon (the one in the alanine's main chain), forming a double bond between them. Then, the nucleophile (the base) would perform a Michael addition to this newly formed conjugated system. The product would then have the nucleophile attached to the beta carbon (now part of the double bond), replacing the azide.

Now, if the mechanism involves these steps, then the stereochemistry at the beta carbon might change. Because during the elimination, the double bond formation would impose a certain configuration, and then the addition would proceed with specific stereochemistry. Alternatively, if there was a possibility of E/Z isomerism or inversion of configuration, that could affect the optical rotation.

Optical rotation is a property that depends on the absolute configuration of chiral centers. If the mechanism involves a rearrangement that changes the configuration of a chiral center, then the product would have a different optical rotation compared to the starting material. 

Wait, the starting dipeptide has Phe and Ala. Both of these amino acids are L-configured. The alanine with the azido group on its beta carbon: since it's L-alanine, its alpha carbon is in L-configuration. The beta carbon (which has the azide) is attached to the alpha carbon. If during the beta-elimination, the double bond forms between alpha and beta, then those carbons become part of a double bond. The adjacent groups might influence the configuration. But when the Michael addition occurs, perhaps the nucleophile adds in a specific stereochemistry, leading to a new chiral center or changing an existing one.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination and addition steps lead to an overall inversion or retention of configuration at a chiral center, leading to a different optical rotation. For instance, if the starting material has a certain absolute configuration and the product ends up with the opposite, the optical rotation would be the opposite (enantiotopic), so the sign would reverse, or if there's a new chiral center introduced with a different configuration, leading to a different rotation magnitude.

Alternatively, maybe the dipeptide itself has multiple chiral centers (from the Phe and Ala), and the reaction changes the configuration at the beta carbon (now part of the double bond, making it planar, so not chiral anymore?), but that might not affect the overall rotation. Wait, but the product would have the nucleophile attached there, so perhaps that creates a new chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that the beta-elimination and Michael addition involve a rearrangement that changes the configuration around a chiral center. Let me think: when you do a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon (in a conjugated system). Let's say the elimination step creates a double bond between Cα and Cβ of the alanine. The double bond would be trans or cis, and then the Michael addition would proceed with a specific stereochemistry. For example, if the dienophile is planar, the nucleophile would attack from the face that's less hindered or based on the electronic factors. 

Suppose that in the starting material, the azido group is in a certain configuration (as part of the L-alanine), and after the elimination and addition, the configuration at that carbon changes. Since optical rotation depends on the arrangement of substituents around a chiral center, a change in configuration would lead to a change in the optical rotation. If there is a new chiral center formed (maybe the carbon where the nucleophile attacks), then the product's optical rotation would differ from the starting material's.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that during the rearrangement, an existing chiral center's configuration is inverted. For instance, if the elimination forms an intermediate that allows for racemization, but the Michael addition then proceeds in a way that locks in a different configuration. Wait, but the question states that the nucleophile forms a bond with the beta-carbon. So maybe the beta-carbon (originally the one with the azide) becomes a new chiral center when the nucleophile attacks? 

Alternatively, maybe the dipeptide as a whole has a certain stereochemistry, and the reaction causes an epimerization at one of the chiral centers. For example, the alanine's beta carbon (with the azide) might become a new chiral center if the nucleophile adds in a way that creates a new stereocenter there. Wait, but the original alanine's beta carbon (with azido) is part of the main chain. Since alanine's main chain already has a chiral alpha carbon. The azido is on the beta carbon, which in the main chain is actually the gamma? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The key is that beta-elimination followed by Michael addition would involve a rearrangement where the configuration around a chiral center is changed, leading to a different optical rotation. Whereas, if the reaction was just a simple nucleophilic substitution (like SN2) at the beta carbon, the configuration might be inverted, but if it's a concerted or stepwise process with a planar intermediate (like in elimination and addition steps), it could lead to retention or inversion in a way that changes the overall rotation.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose the starting material has a certain absolute configuration at a chiral center. After the reaction, if that configuration is inverted, the product would have an optical rotation with the opposite sign. If there's a new chiral center, then the magnitude might change as well. The question states that the nucleophile forms a bond with the beta-carbon. If that carbon becomes chiral, then the product has a new chiral center. The starting material has Phe and Ala, both L, so maybe the product has an additional chiral center or a different configuration leading to a different optical rotation.

The answer given is that there's a difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product. The reasoning must be that such a difference indicates a change in the configuration of a chiral center, which would be explained by a rearrangement mechanism like the proposed beta-elimination and Michael addition, which can lead to such configuration changes, whereas a simple substitution might not. 

Alternatively, if the reaction was just a simple SN2 displacement at the beta carbon (with inversion), then the optical rotation might just invert its sign but the magnitude remains the same? No, actually the magnitude would depend on the actual substituents and their arrangement, so inversion could still lead to a different magnitude. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think: if you have a compound with a certain configuration and you invert it via SN2, then it becomes the enantiomer. The optical rotation would be the exact opposite (same magnitude, opposite sign). But if the mechanism involves a different process where the configuration isn't just inverted, but perhaps a new chiral center is formed, or existing ones are changed in a different way, then the magnitude could change. 

Alternatively, the beta-elimination step might lead to the formation of a double bond, removing a chiral center (since a double bond is planar, so if that carbon was part of a chiral center, it's no longer a chiral center). Then the Michael addition might add a group in a way that creates a new chiral center elsewhere. That would change the number of chiral centers, leading to a different overall optical rotation. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has two chiral centers (Phe and Ala) and the product has three, making the rotation different. The key point here is that the optical rotation is a measure of chirality. A change in optical rotation suggests that the configuration has changed in a way that the overall chirality is different. In a simple substitution like SN2, you might just have inversion, so enantiomer, same magnitude but opposite sign. But the question says "difference in the magnitude", so perhaps the magnitude is different, which would suggest that it's not just an inversion but a different configuration altogether, which would happen in a rearrangement like beta-elimination/Michael addition where the configuration changes in a way that's not just inversion.

Therefore, the presence of a difference in the magnitude (not just sign) of the optical rotation suggests that there's been a change in configuration beyond simple inversion, which would be consistent with the proposed mechanism. So the strongest evidence is that the optical rotation is different in magnitude. 

Another possible evidence might be the formation of a double bond, which could be detected by IR or NMR, but the question is asking for the strongest evidence, and the answer given is about optical rotation. Since optical rotation relates directly to the stereochemistry, if the reaction required a rearrangement that changes a chiral center (or adds a new one), then the observed change in rotation magnitude supports that mechanism over, say, a simple substitution which might not change the magnitude as much. 

Therefore, the correct answer is because a change in optical rotation's magnitude indicates a change in the configuration of a chiral center, which would be expected in a beta-elimination/Michael addition mechanism where such rearrangements occur, rather than a simple nucleophilic substitution.
</think>

The strongest evidence supporting the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **there is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Points:
1. **Mechanism Overview**:
   - **β-Elimination** removes the azido group (N₃⁻) and a proton from the adjacent α-carbon of the alanine, forming a double bond between the α and β-carbons.
   - **Michael addition** then proceeds with the nucleophile attacking the β-carbon (now part of the conjugated double bond), resulting in bond formation with the β-carbon and closure of the double bond.

2. **Stereochemical Implications**:
   - **Chiral Centers**: The starting dipeptide contains chiral centers at the α-carbons of Phe and the original Ala (both L-configured). 
   - **Rearrangement Effects**: The β-elimination introduces a double bond, potentially altering the configuration around existing chiral centers or creating new ones (e.g., at the β-carbon via the Michael addition). 
   - **Optical Rotation Dependence**: Optical rotation is sensitive to the absolute configuration of all chiral centers. A change in configuration (e.g., inversion, retention, or new chiral centers) would alter the magnitude (and possibly the sign) of the optical rotation.

3. **Why This Evidence Is Strong**:
   - **Simple Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2)**: If the reaction were a straightforward SN₂ displacement at the β-carbon, the azido group would be replaced with inversion of configuration. This would produce the **enantio-** or **diastereomeric** product, resulting in an optical rotation of the same magnitude but opposite sign (if enantiomer) or a different magnitude (if diastereomer). However, SN₂ mechanisms typically retain the number of chiral centers.
   - **Rearrangement Mechanism (β-Elimination/Michael Addition)**: This mechanism involves bond-breaking and bond-forming steps that can change existing configurations or create new chiral centers. For example:
     - The β-elimination might disrupt an existing chiral center (e.g., by forming a planar double bond), altering the molecule’s chirality.
     - The Michael addition could introduce a new chiral center at the β-carbon, further modifying the molecule’s overall stereochemistry.
   - **Magnitude Change**: A difference in **magnitude** (not just sign) of optical rotation strongly suggests a configuration change beyond simple inversion, consistent with the rearrangement pathway. In contrast, a simple SN₂ mechanism might only invert configuration (same magnitude, opposite sign) or, at most, produce a diastereomer with a different magnitude.

### Conclusion:
The observed difference in optical rotation’s **magnitude** directly indicates a rearrangement of chiral centers, which aligns with the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism. This evidence is stronger than spectroscopic data (e.g., IR/NMR) because it explicitly ties the mechanism to a stereospecific process, ruling out simpler substitution pathways. 

**Answer**: The difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation confirms a stereochemical rearrangement, consistent with the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the answer to this question is that there's a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem involves a protected dipeptide: Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Here, Phe is L-phenylalanine, and Ala(3-N3) is L-alanine with an azido group on the β-carbon (since the 3rd carbon in alanine would be the β position). When they treat this with a nucleophilic base, the azido group gets replaced by the base, forming a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. They propose that a β-elimination-Michael addition reaction has occurred. The question is asking which evidence best supports this mechanism, and the answer is about optical rotation change. 

First, I need to recall what a β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism involves. In such reactions, a β-elimination would involve the removal of a β-hydrogen along with the azido group, leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated intermediate. The nucleophilic base would then attack this double bond in a Michael addition, adding to the β-carbon. 

Wait, but the question says the azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base forming a bond with the β-carbon. So perhaps the mechanism is that the base abstracts a β-proton (elimination), forming a double bond, then the base attacks the α carbon (Michael addition), which might lead to the nucleophile being added to the β-carbon? Hmm, maybe I need to think of the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the azido group is leaving, and the β-elimination would form an alkene, then the base does a Michael addition to the double bond. But the key here is that this process involves a change in the stereochemistry at the β-carbon. 

Now, the starting dipeptide has L-Ala(3-N3). Since it's L configuration, the β-carbon (carbon 3 in alanine) has two groups: the amino group, the carbonyl (since it's part of the dipeptide), the side chain (which for alanine is just a methyl group), and the azido group. Wait, but in an amino acid, the β-carbon is the carbon adjacent to the α-carbon (the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups). In alanine, the structure is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH, so the β-carbon is the CH2 group? Wait no: Alanine's structure is actually CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH. Wait, actually, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino and carboxyl groups. So the β-carbon would be the carbon before the carboxyl, so the CH2-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Alanine's structure: The amino group is on the α-carbon (C2 in the amino acid numbering?), but actually, the standard numbering for amino acids is that the α-carbon is the one connected to the amino and carboxylic acid groups. So in L-alanine, the α-carbon is the CH(NH2)(COOH) group, and the β-carbon is the methyl group (CH3) connected to the α-carbon. Wait, but that's only two carbons. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. 

Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is on the β-carbon of the alanine. If the alanine has an azido group at position 3, that makes sense as the β-carbon. So in the dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, the protected dipeptide has the azido group on the β-carbon of the alanine. 

Now, when the base is added, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. The mechanism proposed is β-elimination followed by Michael addition. 

Let me consider the β-elimination step. The β-elimination would involve the loss of the azido group and a proton from the β-carbon. Wait, but elimination typically requires a leaving group. The azido group is leaving? But azide is a leaving group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the azido group is being replaced via some substitution that involves a double bond formation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the β-carbon, leading to an elimination of the adjacent azido group. Wait, maybe the azide is leaving as N3^-? But azides can sometimes act as leaving groups under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the mechanism is that the base deprotonates the β-carbon, leading to a resonance-stabilized carbanion, and the azido group leaves, forming a double bond between α and β carbons. Then, the Michael addition would be the base adding to the conjugated double bond, but in such a way that the nucleophile ends up on the β-carbon. 

Crucially, if the mechanism involves a double bond formation, then the configuration at the β-carbon could change. Since the original alanine has a chiral β-carbon (because the β-carbon has four different groups: the α-carbon, the azido group, the methyl group, and the hydrogen?), Wait, hold on, in alanine, the β-carbon is the one with the methyl group. So the β-carbon in alanine is actually the methyl carbon? Wait, perhaps I need to draw the structure.

Alanine is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH. The α-carbon is the central one (carbon attached to NH2 and COOH). The β-carbon is the CH3 attached to it. Wait, but that's only two carbons. Wait, no, maybe in the dipeptide, the β-carbon refers to the position in the context of the dipeptide. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here, but maybe the key point is that the β-elimination creates a double bond, which leads to an intermediate with a different configuration, and the Michael addition then proceeds.

The important thing here is that if a double bond is formed in the β-elimination step, that might lead to an E or Z isomer, but the key point is that the configuration at the β-carbon might be inverted or altered, leading to a change in the optical rotation.

The starting material has a specific configuration (L-Ala with azido on β-carbon), and if during the elimination and addition steps, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon is altered, then the product would have a different optical rotation. 

The question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base, forming a bond with the β-carbon. So the product now has the nucleophile on the β-carbon. The original dipeptide had the azido group there.

If the mechanism involves forming a double bond (elimination) which then allows a nucleophile to add in such a way that the configuration at the β-carbon is inverted, then the product would have a different optical rotation. Since optical rotation is determined by the absolute configuration (or relative if it's a single chiral center), a change in configuration would lead to a change in the magnitude of the optical rotation. For example, if the original was R and becomes S, the rotation would change sign. But if the configuration is inverted at a chiral center, then the optical rotation would invert. However, the question says "difference in the magnitude," so maybe the configuration isn't inverted but becomes a different one. Wait, perhaps during the elimination and addition, the β-carbon becomes a new chiral center? Or maybe the double bond formation could create a new chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination step removes the azido group and a proton, leading to a double bond between the α and β carbons. The original β-carbon (where the azido was) now has a double bond, so it's no longer a tetrahedral center. Wait, but the problem is that the product ends up with the nucleophile attached to the β-carbon. So maybe the elimination forms a double bond, then the Michael addition adds across it, and the nucleophile ends up on the β-carbon. In that case, maybe the configuration of the β-carbon is now different, or perhaps a new chiral center is formed elsewhere?

Alternatively, maybe the elimination creates a double bond, and the addition re-forms a chiral center with the nucleophile, leading to inversion or retention. The key point is that the overall stereochemistry of the molecule changes, leading to a different optical rotation.

So if the starting material has a certain configuration (a specific arrangement of groups around a chiral center), and the mechanism involves a racemization (change in configuration of a chiral center), then the optical rotation would change. Alternatively, if a new chiral center is formed, then the product could have a different rotation.

The question states that the azido group is replaced by the nucleophilic base. Since the original dipeptide has a chiral β-carbon (Ala(3-N3) is L, so the configuration at the β-carbon is determined by the L configuration). When the azido group is removed and replaced by the nucleophile, the configuration at that β-carbon could be altered. For example, if the elimination and addition steps proceed via an achiral intermediate, the product could have a racemic mixture or a different enantiomer, but since the reaction is done under certain conditions, maybe it's a specific configuration. However, the key evidence is the change in optical rotation, which indicates that the configuration has changed, which would support the mechanism involving a change (like through a planar intermediate) leading to a different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, if the mechanism doesn't involve any change in the chiral center, then the optical rotation would stay the same, but in this case, they observe a change, which supports that a stereochemical change occurred, which is consistent with β-elimination and Michael addition, which might lead to such changes.

Wait, another point: the β-elimination would form a double bond, which might create a conjugated system. The Michael addition step then adds to that double bond. The addition could proceed with either syn or anti addition, which might affect the stereochemistry. But perhaps the key is that during elimination, the β-proton is removed from a specific face, leading to inversion at that center?

Alternatively, maybe the elimination step leads to the formation of an enone or something, and the addition brings in the nucleophile in a way that the configuration is inverted, so the optical rotation changes.

Another angle: If the mechanism proceeded via a different pathway, like a simple nucleophilic substitution on the β-carbon, then perhaps the stereochemistry would stay the same or change in a different way. For example, an SN2 reaction would invert configuration, but an SN1 would give a mixture. However, a β-elimination-Michael addition involves different steps that might lead to a different configuration change, which the optical rotation difference would indicate.

Therefore, the strongest evidence for the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism is that the optical rotation changes, indicating a change in stereochemistry, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism. If the reaction instead was a simple substitution without change in configuration, the optical rotation would not change. Since they observe a difference, it supports that a stereogenic center's configuration was altered, which fits with the proposed mechanism's steps involving elimination and addition leading to such a change.

I think that's the reasoning. So the correct answer is about the optical rotation difference because that indicates a stereochemical change, which aligns with the β-elimination-Michael addition pathway which involves such steps.

The strongest evidence supporting the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **there is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. This difference directly indicates a change in the stereochemistry of the molecule, which aligns with the proposed mechanism. Here’s the detailed reasoning:

1. **Mechanism Overview**:  
   - **β-Elimination**: The azido group (N₃) on the β-carbon of the alanine residue is eliminated, likely via deprotonation of the β-carbon by the nucleophilic base. This forms a conjugated α,β-unsaturated double bond.  
   - **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic base then attacks the α-carbon of the conjugated double bond, leading to addition across the double bond and re-forming a chiral center at the β-carbon.  

2. **Stereochemical Implications**:  
   - The starting dipeptide has a defined configuration (L-Ala with the azido group on the β-carbon). During β-elimination, the β-carbon temporarily loses its tetrahedral geometry (as a double bond forms), disrupting its original stereochemistry.  
   - The Michael addition reintroduces a chiral center at the β-carbon, but the reaction pathway’s stereoselectivity (e.g., syn/anti addition or inversion/retention of configuration) can lead to a different stereochemical arrangement compared to the starting material.  

3. **Optical Rotation Change**:  
   - Optical rotation is sensitive to the absolute configuration of chiral centers. A change in the magnitude of the optical rotation (not just sign reversal) suggests a reorganization of stereogenic centers or the creation of a new chiral center.  
   - If the mechanism were a simple nucleophilic substitution (e.g., SN2), the stereochemistry might invert or racemize, but the β-elimination/Michael addition pathway inherently involves a more complex stereochemical rearrangement, consistent with the observed change.  

4. **Alternative Mechanisms**:  
   - A simple nucleophilic substitution without β-elimination would preserve or invert the original stereochemistry (e.g., SN2 inversion), leading to minimal optical rotation changes. The observed difference strongly disfavors such pathways and supports the proposed mechanism.  

**Conclusion**: The change in optical rotation confirms a stereochemical alteration during the reaction, which is a hallmark of the β-elimination–Michael addition pathway. This mechanism uniquely explains the stereochemical reconfiguration at the β-carbon, making the optical rotation evidence definitive.
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about a peptide chemistry reaction where a protected dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe is treated with a nucleophilic base. The azido group (N3) gets replaced by the nucleophile, and the nucleophile bonds with the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. The question is asking which evidence would best support this mechanism, and the correct answer is that there's a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Hmm, I need to understand why that's the case.

First, let me recall what β-elimination and Michael addition are. In β-elimination, a molecule loses a proton and a leaving group from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. A Michael addition involves the nucleophilic attack of a carbanion (the Michael donor) on an electrophilic double bond (the Michael acceptor), adding across the double bond. So putting these together in the context of the dipeptide: the azido group (at the β-carbon of alanine) might be involved in some rearrangement.

The dipeptide here is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the structure is: the N-terminus is protected with Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl), followed by phenylalanine (Phe), then alanine with an azido group on the 3rd carbon (since Ala is usually a 3-carbon amino acid, so maybe the 3-N3 means the side chain carbon has an azido group?), and the C-terminus is OMe (methoxyl).

When they treat this with a nucleophilic base, like maybe something like NaOH or something else, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile. The nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. The mechanism involves β-elimination followed by Michael addition. 

Let me try to imagine the steps. Maybe the β-elimination is the removal of the azido group? Wait, but β-elimination usually involves loss of a leaving group and a proton to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the azido group is acting as the leaving group here? 

Alternatively, perhaps the β-elimination is from the alanine's β-carbon. Let me think. If the azido group is on the β-carbon (the third carbon of alanine's side chain?), maybe the base first deprotonates a hydrogen on the β-carbon, leading to a carbanion, which then loses the azide as a leaving group, forming a double bond. That would be the β-elimination step. 

Then, the intermediate with the double bond would act as a Michael acceptor, and the nucleophile (maybe the base itself, like hydroxide?) would do a Michael addition by attacking the β-carbon's double bond, leading to the addition and forming a new bond there. But how does the nucleophile end up bonded to the β-carbon?

Wait, the product has the nucleophile bonding to the β-carbon. So after the elimination, a conjugated system might form, allowing the Michael addition. Let me sketch this mentally. Let's say the alanine has an azido group on its side chain. The β-elimination would remove the azido group and a proton, creating a double bond between the α and β carbons of the alanine side chain. So the side chain of alanine becomes something like CH2-CH2 (but with the double bond?), but perhaps that's not right. Wait, alanine's side chain is just a methyl group (-CH3), but here it's modified to have an azido group at the 3rd carbon. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Wait, alanine's structure is CH(CH3)COOH. So the α-carbon is the one connected to the amine and carboxyl groups, and the β-carbon would be the one in the side chain? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the 3-N3 is on the third carbon in the alanine. But alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the α-carbon's adjacent carbon is the side chain). Wait, maybe the labeling here is different. Let me think: the alanine in the dipeptide is part of the backbone. Wait no, the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So the sequence is Boc (N-terminus) attached to Phe (phenylalanine), which is then attached to Ala (alanine), which has an azido group on its 3rd carbon, and the C-terminus is OMe. Wait, but the numbering of the amino acid's carbons might be different. For an amino acid, the α-carbon is the one that's attached to the amine and carboxyl groups. The side chain is attached to the α-carbon. So for alanine, the side chain is just a methyl group (-CH3). But if the alanine here has an azido group on the 3rd carbon, perhaps the numbering is such that the β-carbon is the one adjacent to the α-carbon in the backbone? Or maybe they're numbering the side chain carbons?

Hmm, maybe the 3-N3 means that the azido group is on the third carbon of alanine's side chain? But alanine's side chain is only one carbon (the α-carbon's side chain is the methyl group). Wait a second, maybe the numbering here isn't standard? Alternatively, perhaps the azido group is on the β-carbon of the alanine residue. Let me think again: the alanine is in the dipeptide. So in the dipeptide structure, the alanine's α-carbon is connected to the Phe's carbonyl group. The side chain of alanine is just a methyl group. If the 3-N3 is there, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the 3-N3 is on the β-carbon of the whole amino acid chain?

Alternatively, maybe the azido group is on the second carbon of the alanine's side chain? Wait, maybe the problem is that the dipeptide is written as Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, meaning that the Ala has an azido group on the third carbon, but in alanine's case, the third carbon would be part of the side chain? Maybe the numbering here is different. Let's not get bogged down in that. Let's try to proceed.

Assuming that during the reaction, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile at the β-carbon. If the mechanism is β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the key points are that the elimination creates a double bond, then the Michael addition leads to formation of a new bond. The Michael addition involves a stereospecific addition? Or maybe the formation of a new stereocenter?

Wait, the question is about optical rotation. Optical rotation relates to the presence of chiral centers and their configurations. The starting material is a dipeptide with specific stereochemistry. The product has the azido group replaced by the nucleophile. If during the elimination and addition steps, there's a change in the configuration at a chiral center, that would lead to a change in optical rotation.

Alternatively, if the elimination and addition steps involve the formation of a new chiral center or inversion of configuration at an existing one, that would change the optical rotation. 

The β-elimination could lead to a double bond, making the molecule less chiral or changing the stereochemistry. Wait, but let me think step by step.

Let's assume that in the starting dipeptide, the azido group is on a chiral center. For example, if the β-carbon (where the azido is attached) is a chiral center. When the azido is eliminated via β-elimination, the double bond forms, and the former chiral center might lose its chirality? Or perhaps another chiral center is formed during the Michael addition. 

Alternatively, maybe the Michael addition leads to a new chiral center at the β-carbon where the nucleophile attacks. If the Michael addition is stereospecific, the product could have a different configuration at that center compared to the starting material, leading to a different optical rotation.

The key point is that a change in optical rotation would indicate that the stereochemistry has changed. Since the mechanism involves elimination and addition steps, if these steps lead to inversion of configuration or creation of a new stereocenter, then the optical rotation would change. 

But why is this the strongest evidence for the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism? Because other mechanisms might not involve such a stereochemical change. For instance, a direct nucleophilic substitution might occur without changing the optical rotation if it's a simple SN2 where the nucleophile attacks the same carbon, leading to inversion but keeping the same absolute configuration if it's already a chiral center. However, in a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, you might have a different stereochemistry at a different carbon, leading to a different overall rotation.

Alternatively, the mechanism could involve the formation of an intermediate that has different stereochemistry. Let me think again. Let's suppose the starting material has a certain configuration. After elimination, the intermediate has a double bond. Then the Michael addition's approach of the nucleophile could lead to a preference for one face of the double bond, leading to a specific stereochemistry at the new carbon where the nucleophile bonds. This could create a new chiral center or change an existing one's configuration, thus altering the optical rotation. 

If the mechanism were different, say a simple substitution without the elimination and addition steps, the stereochemistry might not change as much. For example, if the azido group was a leaving group and the nucleophile just attacked the same carbon, then if that carbon was chiral, you might get inversion but the overall rotation might not change much if it's a simple SN2, or maybe if there are multiple chiral centers, but perhaps in the given case, the elimination and addition steps lead to a different configuration at a different carbon, hence a different optical rotation.

Therefore, the presence of a change in optical rotation would indicate that there's a change in the stereochemistry of the product compared to the starting material. This would support the mechanism involving these steps because such a mechanism would involve rearrangement and stereochemical changes, while a simple substitution might not. 

Hence, the strongest evidence is that there's a difference in the optical rotation magnitude, which would be due to the change in stereochemistry caused by the β-elimination and Michael addition steps. Other pieces of evidence might include isotopic labeling, observation of intermediates, etc., but the question is about the strongest evidence here, which is the optical rotation change.

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is **there is a difference in the magnitude of the optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product**. Here's why:

### Key Explanation:
1. **Stereochemical Change During the Mechanism**:
   - **β-Elimination**: The azido group (N₃) is replaced by a double bond formation between adjacent carbons (e.g., α- and β-carbons of the alanine residue). This elimination can eliminate a chiral center or alter its configuration, reducing the molecule's chirality or creating a new double bond that may influence the overall rotation.
   - **Michael Addition**: The nucleophile attacks the conjugated double bond (formed during elimination) in a stereospecific manner. This step can introduce a new chiral center or invert the configuration at an existing one, leading to a distinct stereochemistry compared to the starting material.

2. **Optical Rotation and Stereochemistry**:
   - Optical rotation is directly tied to the molecule's stereochemistry. A change in rotation indicates a change in the spatial arrangement of chiral centers or the presence of new ones.
   - In a simple substitution (e.g., SN1/SN2) without elimination and addition steps, the stereochemical changes might be minimal or restricted to a single center, resulting in less drastic rotation differences. However, the β-elimination/Michael addition mechanism inherently involves rearrangement steps that disrupt existing chirality or create new stereocenters, thereby altering the optical rotation significantly.

3. **Ruling Out Other Evidence**:
   - Other evidence (e.g., isotopic labeling, intermediate observation) might support the mechanism but are either indirect or dependent on additional experimental work. The optical rotation difference is a direct and unambiguous indicator of stereochemical changes, which are critical to the proposed mechanism.

### Conclusion:
The observed change in optical rotation directly demonstrates that the mechanism involves stereochemical rearrangements (e.g., elimination of a chiral center followed by stereocontrolled addition). This provides strong evidence that β-elimination and Michael addition steps occurred, rather than a simpler nucleophilic substitution that preserves the original stereochemistry. Thus, the optical rotation change is the most compelling evidence for the proposed mechanism.
