Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The answer given is 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH. Hmm, let me think through each step.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexylacetylene. The target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me write down the structures to visualize better. The starting material has a triple bond between the cyclohexane ring and a methyl group (since acetylene is -C≡CH). The target has a chiral center with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl substituent attached to a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). 

First, the first reagent is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Sodium amide (NaNH2) is a strong base. Ethyl chloride is CH2CH3Cl. I remember that NaNH2 can deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylide ions. Wait, but ethyl chloride is an alkyl halide. Maybe they're doing an alkylation here? Since acetylide is a strong nucleophile, reacting with ethyl chloride would give an alkylation at the triple bond. Let me think: if you have an acetylene (R-C≡C-H), treating with NaNH2 (which deprotonates to give R-C≡C^-) then adding an alkyl halide would alkylate the acetylide. So, for ethynylcyclohexane (which is cyclohexylacetylene, R = cyclohexyl), the acetylide would be cyclohexylacetylide. Then, reacting with ethyl chloride (ethyl iodide would be better, but maybe ethyl chloride works here with NaNH2), you'd get alkylated at the triple bond. The product would be cyclohexyl-(ethyl)propyne? Wait, adding an ethyl group to the acetylene. Let me count the carbons. The starting molecule is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After deprotonation to cyclohexyl-C≡C^- then reacting with ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl), the ethyl group would add to the acetylide, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, no, maybe it's cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, reaction of acetylide with alkyl halide (RX) gives R'-C≡C-R, where R' is cyclohexyl and R is ethyl. So the product would be cyclohexyl-ethyl acetylene, but that's a triple bond between the two alkyl groups. But wait, that would form a propargyl group? Hmm, but the next step is Li in liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction. Birch reduction typically reduces aromatic rings, but maybe it can reduce alkynes here? Let me recall: Birch reduction uses Li in ammonia, which can reduce alkenes and alkynes to their corresponding alkanes, but sometimes under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation?

Wait, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Birch reduction is usually for aromatic rings, but maybe in this case, it's for reducing the triple bond? Let me check. The reaction of an alkyne with Li in liquid NH3 usually reduces the alkyne to the trans-cyclopropyl derivative, but sometimes under different conditions it can reduce further. Alternatively, maybe it's just a simple hydrogenation to an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the acetylene is reduced to an alkene. Wait, but let's see. Let me think step by step.

First step: Alkylation of the acetylene. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene) which is R-C≡CH. Treating with NaNH2 gives R-C≡C^- (acetylide). Then adding ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl) would give R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Wait, but the order here: the acetylide is formed, then alkylated. So that would indeed form a propargyl group (three carbons with the triple bond between first and second). Wait, actually, in this case, the original structure is R-C≡CH (with R being cyclohexyl). After alkylation, it becomes R-C≡C-CH2CH3. So overall, that's a triple bond between the cyclohexyl and the ethyl group? Wait, no, the triple bond is between the two carbons: the original C≡C becomes after alkylation, the acetylide (C≡C^-) attacks the ethyl chloride, so the alkyl group (ethyl) is added to the acetylide. The structure would be cyclohexyl-(C≡C-CH2CH3). So the triple bond is between the original carbon (attached to cyclohexane) and the next carbon, which then has an ethyl group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-ethyl-propyne? Maybe written as cyclohexyl-1-ethynylpropane? Not sure about the exact name, but the key is that there's a triple bond between two carbons, now with an ethyl group added. 

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction? Birch reduction typically uses Li in ammonia, sometimes with water, to reduce aromatic rings or conjugated systems. But maybe here it's reducing the triple bond. Let me recall that alkynes can be reduced with Li/NH3. If the alkyne is terminal, it can be reduced to an alkene. But if it's internal, maybe different. Wait, but in this case, after the first step, the alkyne would be an internal alkyne? Let me see the structure again. The original acetylene is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexylacetylene). After alkylation with ethyl chloride, the triple bond would still be between the cyclohexyl carbon and the next carbon, but now that next carbon has an ethyl group. Wait, perhaps the alkylation is at the end? Let me clarify:

The starting structure is:

Cyclohexyl-C≡CH

After deprotonation with NaNH2, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C^-.

Adding ethyl chloride (which is an alkyl halide) would lead to an SN2 reaction? But at a triple bond? Wait, no, acetylide ions can react with alkyl halides in an SN2 fashion, but the acetylide is a strong nucleophile. The reaction would proceed by the acetylide attacking the alkyl halide. So the alkyl group (ethyl) is added to the acetylide, leading to:

Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

So the triple bond is still between the cyclohexyl carbon and the next carbon (now connected to ethyl). Wait, but that's an internal alkyne? Because now the triple bond is between the first and second carbons (with the second carbon having an ethyl group). Wait, no, actually, the structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. The triple bond is between the first carbon (attached to cyclohexane) and the second carbon (which is attached to the ethyl group). The rest is a methyl group? Wait, maybe the ethyl group is attached to the second carbon, so the triple bond is between first and second carbons, and the second carbon has another bond to ethyl. So that makes the triple bond adjacent to an ethyl group? Wait, the structure is:

Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the second carbon (the one in the triple bond) is bonded to the cyclohexyl, the triple bond, and the ethyl group? That can't be right because the triple bond is three bonds, so the carbon on the triple bond can't have another bond. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me draw it properly. The original ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-CH2 triple bond? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So structure is:

Cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So after NaNH2, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C^- (acetylide). Then adding ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl), the ethyl group is added to the acetylide carbon. The mechanism would be the acetylide (which has a negative charge on the triple-bonded carbon) attacks the ethyl chloride. The ethyl group is the R group in RX, so the acetylide would form a bond with that carbon. Thus, the product becomes:

Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Actually, but the second carbon (the one in the triple bond) is bonded to the cyclohexyl, the triple bond, and the ethyl group? That can't be right because the triple bond is three bonds, so the carbon on the triple bond can't have another bond. Wait, maybe it's cyclohexane attached to a C≡C- group? Wait. Let me draw it properly. The original ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-CH2 triple bond? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So structure is:

Cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So after NaNH2, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C^- (acetylide). Then adding ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl), the ethyl group is added to the acetylide carbon. The mechanism would be the acetylide (which has a negative charge on the triple-bonded carbon) attacks the ethyl chloride. The ethyl group is the R group in RX, so the acetylide would form a bond with that carbon. Thus, the product becomes:

Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

However, but the second carbon (the one in the triple bond) is bonded to the cyclohexyl, the triple bond, and the ethyl group? That can't be right because the triple bond is three bonds, so the carbon on the triple bond can't have another bond. Wait, maybe it would attack the ethyl chloride? Wait. Let me draw it properly. The original ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-CH2 triple bond? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So structure is:

Cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So after NaNH2, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C^- (acetylide). Then adding ethyl chloride (CH2CH3Cl), the ethyl group is added to the acetylide carbon. The mechanism would be the acetylide (which has a negative charge on the triple-bonded carbon) attacks the ethyl chloride. The ethyl group is the R group in RX, so the acetylide would form a bond with that carbon. Thus, the product becomes:

Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.
