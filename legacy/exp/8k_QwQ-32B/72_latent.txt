There is a multiple-choice question: Which of the following statements are true concerning information criteria?

(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion

(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall

(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion

(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent. The options are: A. (ii) and (iv) only, B. (i) and (iii) only, C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only, D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). Why the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to this question is C, which says that statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true, but (iv) is not. Let me go through each statement one by one and think through them.

Starting with statement (i): "Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion." Hmm, I remember that adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It's used to combat the problem that R-squared tends to increase with more predictors even if they don't have a significant effect. Information criteria like AIC (Akaike's) and BIC (Schwarz's) also penalize model complexity to prevent overfitting. But is adjusted R-squared considered an information criterion? I might be mixing up terms here. Let me recall: information criteria are usually formulas that include a goodness-of-fit measure and a penalty term for the number of parameters. Adjusted R-squared is different because it's a normalized measure of fit that adjusts R-squared by the number of terms. But I think adjusted R-squared isn't classified as an information criterion in the statistical literature. Wait, the question is asking if it's an information criterion. Maybe some sources consider it as such, but I think traditionally, AIC and BIC are the main ones. Hmm, this might be a point of confusion. Let me think again. Adjusted R-squared is a form of penalized R-squared, but information criteria like AIC and BIC are based on likelihoods. So, maybe adjusted R-squared isn't an information criterion in the strict sense. That would mean statement (i) is false, which contradicts the answer being C. Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to include (i)... Hmm, maybe I need to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering "information criterion" more broadly. I might be wrong here. Let me look up in my mind: Information criteria like AIC, BIC, and maybe others (like HQ) are criteria for model selection that balance goodness of fit with model complexity. Adjusted R-squared is a version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors, so it also penalizes complexity, but it's not typically referred to as an information criterion. The term "information criterion" usually refers to the ones derived from information theory, like AIC and BIC. So maybe statement (i) is actually false? If that's the case, then the answer can't be C. Wait, but the user says the correct answer is C, so maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, adjusted R-squared is considered an information criterion. Let me check definitions again. 

According to some sources, information criteria are measures that estimate the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. They typically include an adjustment for the number of parameters to avoid overfitting. Adjusted R-squared does this, so maybe it is considered an information criterion in a broader sense. Wait, but AIC and BIC are more specific types of information criteria, based on information theory. The term "information criterion" might be more associated with those. Hmm. Maybe the question's answer considers adjusted R-squared as an information criterion here, so (i) is true. Let me tentatively accept that for now, since the answer includes (i). I'll come back.

Moving on to statement (ii): "If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall." Let's think. The residual sum of squares (RSS) is part of the goodness-of-fit measure. When you add a term, RSS usually decreases or stays the same. The information criterion (like AIC or BIC) is a function that includes -2 log likelihood (which for OLS regression is related to RSS) plus a penalty term based on the number of parameters. Let me recall the formula for AIC: AIC = 2k - 2 ln(L), where k is the number of parameters. In linear regression with Gaussian errors, the log-likelihood can be written in terms of RSS: ln(L) = -n/2 ln(2π) - n/2 ln(σ²) - 1/(2σ²) RSS. Therefore, -2 ln(L) would be proportional to RSS. So when you add a term, RSS decreases, so the first part (the log-likelihood part) improves (since RSS is smaller), but the penalty term (2k) increases. Whether the overall AIC decreases depends on the tradeoff. However, the question states that if RSS falls, will the information criterion value fall? Not necessarily. Suppose adding a term reduces RSS by a little but the penalty term increases by more. Then AIC could increase. So the statement (ii) is saying that if RSS decreases, then the information criterion will decrease, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, maybe (ii) is false? But the given answer says (ii) is true, so this is conflicting.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to a situation where adding an additional term always reduces RSS? If you add a new variable, the RSS can't increase, it can only decrease or stay the same. So when you add a term, RSS decreases or stays the same. The question says "if the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added", so assuming that the term added actually does decrease RSS (which is possible, but maybe sometimes it doesn't?), then does the information criterion necessarily decrease? Hmm. Let's formalize it for AIC. Suppose before adding the term, AIC was 2k - 2 ln(L_old). After adding, it's 2(k+1) - 2 ln(L_new). The change is 2(k+1) - 2 ln(L_new) - [2k - 2 ln(L_old)] = 2 - 2[ln(L_new) - ln(L_old)]. Since adding the variable, L_new >= L_old, so ln(L_new) - ln(L_old) >=0. Thus the change in AIC is 2 - 2*(something non-negative). So if the increase in log-likelihood is less than 1, then the AIC will increase. So even if RSS decreases, the information criterion (AIC) might increase. 

Therefore, statement (ii) is not necessarily true. But the given answer says (ii) is true. This is a problem. Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding. Maybe in the question, they are referring to the information criterion's value decreasing when RSS falls? But even if RSS falls, the penalty term might be too big. So the answer's (ii) is incorrect? But since the correct answer is C which includes (ii), maybe my reasoning is wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not general but assumes that the information criterion is one that only considers RSS without penalty? No, that can't be. Wait, the question says "information criterion" in general. But all information criteria have a penalty term, so even if RSS decreases, the penalty might offset it. Therefore statement (ii) is false, which would mean the correct answer is not C. But the user says the correct answer is C. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the information criterion only uses RSS and no penalty? That's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong? Hmm, maybe I need to think again. Let me try another angle.

Suppose we have a model with an additional term. The RSS decreases, so when calculating AIC, the first part (the likelihood part) improves, but the penalty (number of parameters) increases. So the question says "if RSS falls, then the value of the information criterion will fall". Since the improvement in likelihood might be enough to offset the penalty, but it's not guaranteed, so the statement is not necessarily true. Therefore (ii) is false, so the correct answer cannot include (ii). But since the user is saying that the correct answer is C (including ii), perhaps there is a different interpretation.

Definitionally, perhaps the question is assuming that the information criterion only uses RSS and no penalty? That's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong? Hmm, Maybe in some textbooks or contexts. Let me take a case where the added variable is actually a correct variable.

Suppose we have a model with an additional term. The RSS decreases, so when calculating AIC, the first part (the likelihood part) improves, but the penalty (number of parameters) increases. So the question says "if RSS falls, then the value of the information criterion will fall".

Therefore (ii) is false, so the correct answer cannot include (ii). But since the user is saying that the correct answer is C (including ii), perhaps there is a different interpretation.
