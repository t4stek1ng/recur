There is a multiple-choice question: A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is. The options are: A. 0.04 V, B. 0.1 V, C. 2.5 V, D. 10 V. Why the correct answer is B. 0.1 V?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this problem here about a magnetic field and a coil, and I need to find the average induced EMF. Let me see... The question says there's a circular coil with an area of 0.2 m² and 250 turns. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil's plane, and it's increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T over 0.25 seconds. The options are A to D, and the correct answer is supposed to be B, 0.1 V. Hmm, let me work through this step by step.

First, I remember that induced EMF in a coil is related to the change in magnetic flux through the coil. Faraday's Law, right? Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction states that the induced EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux linkage. The formula is EMF = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt), where N is the number of turns, and ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux over time Δt.

Okay, so I need to calculate the change in magnetic flux first. Magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * cosθ, where B is the magnetic field, A is the area, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil. Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, θ is 0 degrees, so cosθ = 1. Therefore, Φ = B * A.

The change in flux, ΔΦ, would then be the final flux minus the initial flux. That is, ΔΦ = (B_final - B_initial) * A. Plugging in the numbers: B_final is 0.06 T, B_initial is 0.01 T, so the difference is 0.05 T. The area A is 0.2 m². So ΔΦ = 0.05 T * 0.2 m² = 0.01 Wb (since 1 Wb = 1 T·m²).

Wait, let me check that again. 0.06 minus 0.01 is 0.05 T, right. Multiply that by area 0.2, so 0.05 * 0.2 = 0.01. Yep. So the change in flux is 0.01 Weber. Then, the rate of change of flux is ΔΦ over Δt. The time interval is 0.25 seconds, so ΔΦ/Δt = 0.01 Wb / 0.25 s. Let me calculate that: 0.01 divided by 0.25. Hmm, 0.01 divided by 0.25 is the same as 0.01 * (4/1) = 0.04? Wait, no, that's not right. Because 0.25 goes into 0.01 how many times? Let me think. 0.25 * 0.04 = 0.01. Wait, actually, yes. 0.25 multiplied by 0.04 equals 0.01, so 0.01 divided by 0.25 is indeed 0.04. Hmm, so then the rate of change is 0.04 Wb/s. 

But then the EMF is N times that, right? Since N is 250 turns. So EMF = 250 * 0.04 V? Let's compute that: 250 times 0.04. 250 times 0.04 is 10. So that would give 10 volts? But the answer is supposed to be B, 0.1 V. Wait, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong here?

No then the EMF is N times that, right? Since N is 250 turns. So EMF = 250 * 0.04 V? Let's compute that: 250 times 0.04. 250 times 0.04 is 10. So that would give 10 volts? But the answer is supposed to be B, 0.1 V. Wait, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong here?

Alright then the EMF is N times that, right? Since N is 250 turns. So EMF = 250 * 0.04 V? Let's compute that: 250 times 0.04. 250 times 0.04 is 10. So that would give 10 volts? But the answer is supposed to be B, 0.1 V. Wait, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong here?
