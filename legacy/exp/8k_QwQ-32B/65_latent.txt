There is a multiple-choice question: Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.. Why the correct answer is D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the Bera-Jarque test null hypothesis question is option D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Let me start by recalling what the Bera-Jarque test is about. I think it's a statistical test used to check if a dataset has the same skewness and kurtosis as a normal distribution. The null hypothesis is probably that the data comes from a normally distributed population, right?

Wait, the normal distribution has a skewness of zero because it's symmetric, and its kurtosis is three. But hold on, kurtosis can be a bit confusing because sometimes people refer to excess kurtosis, which subtracts three. So maybe that's where the confusion comes in. Let me check that again.

The Jarque-Bera test (I think it's usually called Jarque-Bera, not Bera-Jarque, but maybe it's the same test) combines skewness and kurtosis to test for normality. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which would have skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3. But the options here are different. The options given are A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm, wait a second. The normal distribution has skewness zero and kurtosis three, so the null hypothesis should be B? But the user is saying the correct answer is D. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, maybe there's a different parameterization. Let me recall the formula for the Jarque-Bera test statistic. The Jarque-Bera statistic is defined as:

JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (C^2)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, S should be 0 and C (which is excess kurtosis) should be 0, meaning the actual kurtosis is 3. So the null hypothesis would require S = 0 and kurtosis = 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Okay, wait a second. The normal distribution has skewness zero and kurtosis three, so the null hypothesis should be B? But the user is saying the correct answer is D. maybe it's a misspelling of the Berk-Jones test? Not sure. Let me try α = 2 and β = 2.

Again, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, maybe there's a different parameterization. Let me think again for the Jarque-Bera test statistic. The Jarque-Bera statistic is defined as:

JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (C^2)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, S should be 0 and C (which is excess kurtosis) should be 0, meaning the actual kurtosis is 3. So the null hypothesis would require S = 0 and kurtosis = 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Wait, wait a second. The normal distribution has skewness zero and kurtosis three, so the null hypothesis should be B? But the user is saying the correct answer is D. maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me confirm.

Now, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, maybe there's a different parameterization. Let me recall for the Jarque-Bera test statistic. The Jarque-Bera statistic is defined as:

JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (C^2)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, S should be 0 and C (which is excess kurtosis) should be 0, meaning the actual kurtosis is 3. So the null hypothesis would require S = 0 and kurtosis = 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.
