There is a multiple-choice question: A researcher tests for structural stability in the following regression model:

$y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_{2t} + \beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t$

The total sample of 200 observations is split exactly in half for the sub-sample regressions. Which would be the unrestricted residual sum of squares?. The options are: A. The RSS for the whole sample, B. The RSS for the first sub-sample, C. The RSS for the second sub-sample, D. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples. Why the correct answer is A. The RSS for the whole sample?<|im_end|>

Okay, so there's this question about structural stability in a regression model, and it's a multiple-choice question asking which one is the unrestricted residual sum of squares (RSS). The options are A to D, with D being the sum of the RSS from the two subsamples and A being the RSS for the whole sample. The answer is supposed to be A, but I need to figure out why.

First, I need to recall what structural stability means. From what I remember, testing structural stability often involves checking if the coefficients of a regression model are consistent across different subsets of the data. A common test is the Chow test, which I think compares the unrestricted and restricted RSS. Let me try to remember how the Chow test works.

In the Chow test, you have a regression model split into two subsamples. You estimate the model in three ways: 1) the restricted model, which assumes that the coefficients are the same across both subsamples, and 2) the unrestricted model, which allows the coefficients to differ between the two subsamples. The test then compares their RSS values to see if the difference is significant.

Wait, so the restricted model is the one where you estimate the regression on the entire sample as a single model without considering the split. That would give you a single set of coefficients. The unrestricted model, on the other hand, is when you run the regression separately on each subsample, allowing each subsample to have its own coefficients. 

Therefore, the RSS for the restricted model is the RSS from the entire sample, because it's assuming no structural break and just using all data together. The unrestricted RSS would be the sum of the RSS from each subsample's regression since those regressions can adjust to the different structures in each subsample. 

Wait, hold on, the question says: "Which would be the unrestricted residual sum of squares?" The options are between the whole sample RSS (A) and the sum of the two subsample RSS (D). But according to the Chow test, the unrestricted RSS is the sum of the two subsamples. So why is the correct answer A?
