[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is A for the question about OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimation. The options are about what OLS minimizes: vertical distances, squares of vertical distances, horizontal distances, or squares of horizontal distances. Hmm, I remember that OLS has something to do with minimizing the sum of squared errors, but let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recall what OLS is. OLS is a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. The goal is to find the line that best fits the data points. Now, how does it do that? I think it's about the vertical distances between the observed data points and the regression line. But wait, there's a difference between minimizing the sum of the distances and minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances. 

The question is asking which statement is TRUE. The options are confusing because they mix vertical vs. horizontal and sum vs. sum of squares. Let me parse each option:

A. OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances.  
B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances.  
C. OLS minimizes the sum of the horizontal distances.  
D. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances.

So, first, I need to remember whether OLS minimizes the sum (without squaring) or the sum of squares. I'm pretty sure it's the sum of squares. The term "least squares" itself suggests that squaring is involved. So that might eliminate options A and C, since they don't have squares. But then between B and D. 

Now, vertical vs. horizontal distances. In standard linear regression, we are predicting the dependent variable (y) based on the independent variable(s) (x). The errors or residuals are the differences between the observed y values and the predicted y values. So those are vertical distances. If we were to minimize horizontal distances, that might be in a different context, like when both variables are considered to have errors, or in some cases of errors-in-variables regression. But in standard OLS, it's vertical distances.

Therefore, the correct answer should be either B or A depending on whether it's the sum or the sum of squares. Since OLS is "least squares," it's definitely the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. So that would be option B. Wait, but the user is saying the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I misremember. Let me think of the formula for OLS. The objective function in OLS is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, where residuals are the vertical distances (since each residual is y_i - ŷ_i). So the residual is vertical. Therefore, the objective is Sum[(y_i - ŷ_i)^2], so that's the sum of squares of vertical distances. So that would make B the correct answer, not A. 

But the question states that the correct answer is A. Maybe the question is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the question is a trick question? Let me check if there's a difference between minimizing the sum of vertical distances versus sum of squares. 

Minimizing the sum of absolute vertical distances would be least absolute deviations, not OLS. OLS specifically uses squares. So if the question is about OLS, then B is correct. However, the user says the correct answer is A. That's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased in a way that "sum of the vertical distances" is considered as the same as "sum of squares"? But that doesn't make sense. The wording in the options is different: option A says "sum of vertical distances" (so sum of absolute values?), while B says "sum of squares of vertical distances". 

Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding in the question, the correct answer should be B. But the user is asking why A is correct, so perhaps there's a mistake in the question or in their assertion? Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to something else? Let me re-read the options:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

Therefore, the key difference between A and B is whether it's the sum (of vertical distances) or sum of squares. Since OLS is least squares, B is correct. However, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or maybe there's a trick here.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to minimizing the sum of distances, but actually, OLS is about squares. Therefore, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer should indeed be B, but the user says the correct answer is A, so I need to figure out why.

Wait, maybe the question is in a context where they're referring to minimizing the sum (not squared) of vertical distances, but that's not OLS. Wait, maybe the term is sometimes used differently? Let me check my knowledge again.

No, OLS is definitely about minimizing the sum of squared residuals. The "least squares" refers to the squares. Therefore, option B is correct. Unless the question is wrong, but the user is asking why the answer is A. So there must be some confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not in the context of linear regression but in some other context where vertical distances are minimized in the sum? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the question is using "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" as a way to describe the squares, but that's not accurate. The sum of distances (without squaring) is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are miswritten. Let me consider if there's a misunderstanding. For example, if the question said "minimizes the vertical distances", but actually it's minimizing the sum of squares. Since OLS minimizes the sum of squares, but in common language, people might say "minimizes the distances", but that's technically incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the real correct answer is B, but the user was told that A is correct. Since the user is asking why A is correct, perhaps they are confused. 

Wait, maybe there is a different interpretation. If we think of vertical distance as the error term, which is squared in the loss function, but "sum of vertical distances" could be ambiguous. For example, maybe the question is considering the vertical distances in absolute terms, but OLS squares them. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly written, and the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding between distance and squared distance. But in standard terminology, OLS is about minimizing the sum of squares of vertical distances. So the correct answer should be B. 

Wait, unless the question is a trick question and the options are not properly written. For example, perhaps in some sources, people refer to OLS as minimizing the sum (not squared) but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that considers "sum of vertical distances" as the same as "sum of squared vertical distances", but that is not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding between vertical vs horizontal. Since in OLS, the vertical distances are minimized in squares, but if someone mistakenly thinks that it minimizes the sum (not squared) of vertical distances, then they might choose A. 

Given that, perhaps the question is designed to test whether the student knows the difference between minimizing the sum and sum of squares, and the fact that OLS is "least squares" so the answer is B. But since the user says that the correct answer is A, maybe there is a mistake in the question's options. Alternatively, the user might have misread the options.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" but in reality, when you minimize the sum of squares, you are also minimizing the sum of distances in some sense, but that's not true. The sum of squares is different from the sum of absolute distances.

Wait, perhaps the question is in a context where "distance" is defined as squared distance, but that's non-standard. In standard math, distance is a non-negative value, so the vertical distance would be the absolute value of the residual, and squared distance would be the square. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "sum of vertical distances" as a way to refer to the sum of squared distances, but that would be incorrect terminology. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source where the translation is off. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "sum of the vertical distances" is actually referring to the sum of the residuals (which in OLS sum to zero), but that's not the same as minimizing the sum. Wait, in OLS, the residuals do sum to zero, but that's a property, not the objective. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which is different from minimizing the sum of residuals (which would just be setting each residual to zero, which isn't possible unless the points are on a line).

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the user is confused. Since the question is presented as "Why is A the correct answer?" but logically it should be B, perhaps the user needs to be informed of that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the options are reversed. For example, if the question said "sum of squared vertical distances" was the answer, that would be B, but maybe the question had a different wording. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an econometrics context where sometimes people refer to just the "sum of residuals" but in absolute terms but that's still not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because when people informally say "distance", they might be referring to the vertical error, but technically, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares. So maybe the question is a bit of a trick, where it says "sum of vertical distances" but actually OLS minimizes the squares, so none of the options are strictly correct except B. But if the options are presented as is, then only B is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong and the user is confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my thinking. Let me re-verify.

OLS: The ordinary least squares estimator is the set of coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals. The residual for each data point is the difference between the observed y and the predicted y (i.e., the vertical distance from the point to the regression line). Therefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of these vertical distances. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B, not A. So perhaps the original question had a typo, or the user is mistaken in the correct answer. Since the user is asking why A is correct, but according to standard econometrics, it should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different perspective. For example, in some contexts, people might refer to minimizing the sum of the residuals (the errors) without squaring, but in OLS, we square them to penalize larger errors more and to have a convex function. The sum of residuals in OLS indeed is zero due to the first-order conditions, but that's not the objective. The objective is to minimize the sum of squares. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that OLS minimizes the sum of vertical distances (i.e., absolute residuals), that would be incorrect. That's known as LAD (least absolute deviations) regression. 

Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding in the question, the answer should be B. The user might have been given incorrect information, or there is a mistake in the question's options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the direction of minimization, but the vertical distances are in the residual direction, so that's still squared. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that incorrectly states that OLS minimizes the sum of vertical distances, not the squares. That could be a common misconception. So the user might have encountered a test question that has an error, and is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are miswritten. For example, if option A was "sum of the squares of the vertical distances", then B and A would be the same. But as written, it's A and B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a different language and "sum" was mistranslated. 

In any case, based on standard econometric theory, the correct answer should be B: OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Therefore, either the question is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the options. The user is asking why the correct answer is A, but according to standard definitions, it's not. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to minimizing the sum of the vertical distances in some other sense, such as prediction accuracy, but no, the loss function is the squared error. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the question refers to "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances", but in terms of the direction of the distance (vertical vs horizontal), then A is correct in the sense that it's vertical, but not about the squaring. But the question is which statement is true, so between A and B, both talk about vertical distances, but differ on sum vs sum of squares. Since OLS uses squares, B is true. 

Therefore, conclusion: The correct answer is B. The user might have a mistake in their question's provided correct answer, or perhaps misread the options. If the user is asking why A is correct, there might be a mistake in their materials. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again. Suppose someone thinks that OLS minimizes the vertical distances without squaring. Then they might choose A. But that's wrong. Alternatively, maybe in simple terms, people say "minimizes the distance", but technically it's the squares. 

Alternatively, the question might have a typo, and the actual correct answer is B, but the user thought it was A. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vertical vs horizontal is the key. For example, if you minimized horizontal distances, that would be different (like in Deming regression), but OLS is vertical. So the correct answer is between A or B for vertical, and C/D for horizontal. Since it's OLS, vertical is correct. So between A and B, so the difference is sum vs squares. 

So, final check: OLS is "ordinary least squares", so squares are involved. Therefore, B is correct. Hence, the user's question may have an error in stating that A is correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the user might have encountered an incorrect question, and the correct answer is actually B. However, if the question insists that A is correct, then perhaps in some contexts there's a different interpretation. But given standard econometrics, B is the correct answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake? Let me check a textbook reference. 

From Wikipedia on OLS: "The OLS estimator is obtained by minimizing the total squared error... In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable is a linear combination of the parameters (but need not be linear in terms of the independent variables). To carry out minimization, the sum over all observations of the squared residuals is computed." 

Therefore, the key is the sum of squared residuals, i.e., the sum of squared vertical distances. So B is correct. Therefore, the user might have an error in their question's correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is considered correct in some educational materials as a simplification, ignoring the squaring, but that's technically inaccurate. 

Therefore, given the information, I think the correct answer should be B, not A. The user might need to double-check their source. But since the user is asking why A is correct, I have to explain that perhaps there is a mistake in the question or the user's understanding. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different perspective. For example, if the question is about the direction of the distance (vertical vs horizontal), then A is correct in that it is vertical, but the minimization is of the squares. Therefore, both aspects (vertical and squares) must be true. Since B mentions both vertical and squares, while A only mentions vertical. Therefore, B is a more precise correct answer. 

Alternatively, if the question is a multiple-response question but presented as single-select, but the user says "Which of the following is TRUE", implying single-select. So between the options, B is true, A is false because it omits the squaring. 

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is B, and the user might have a mistake in their materials. However, if the question is as presented, and the correct answer is A, then perhaps the question is incorrect. Therefore, in my explanation, I should clarify that according to standard OLS, the correct answer is B, so either there's a mistake in the question or a misunderstanding.

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Key Points:
1. **OLS Definition**:  
   - **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** is a method to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. Its core principle is to find the line that **minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances** (residuals) between the observed data points and the regression line.  
   - The term "least squares" explicitly refers to minimizing the **sum of squared residuals**, not the sum of absolute values (which would be "least absolute deviations").

2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**:  
   - In standard linear regression, the dependent variable (**y**) is the outcome we are predicting, and the independent variable (**x**) is the predictor. The residuals (errors) are calculated as the **vertical distances** between observed **y** values and predicted **ŷ** values.  
   - OLS focuses on vertical distances because it assumes that errors are in the **y-direction** (i.e., **x** is measured without error). Minimizing horizontal distances would be relevant in models like Deming regression, where errors exist in both variables.

3. **Sum vs. Sum of Squares**:  
   - **Option A** ("sum of vertical distances") incorrectly omits squaring the distances. OLS does not minimize the sum of vertical distances directly; it minimizes the **sum of their squares** (as in **Option B**).  
   - Squaring the residuals ensures that larger errors are penalized more heavily, leading to a convex optimization problem with a unique solution. This is fundamental to OLS.

4. **Why Option B is Correct**:  
   - The objective function for OLS is:  
     \[
     \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2,
     \]  
     where \(y_i - \hat{y}_i\) represents the vertical distance (residual) for each data point.  
   - This directly matches **Option B**, which specifies minimizing the **sum of squares of vertical distances**.

### Why Option A is Incorrect:
- **Option A** claims OLS minimizes the **sum of vertical distances**, which would imply minimizing the sum of absolute residuals (\(\sum |y_i - \hat{y}_i|\)). This is **not** OLS—it describes **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** regression, a different method.

### Conclusion:
The confusion likely arises from conflating the **direction** (vertical vs. horizontal) with the **objective** (sum of distances vs. sum of squares). While OLS does involve vertical distances, it is the **squared** vertical distances that are minimized. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**, not A. If your materials indicate that A is correct, there may be an error in the question or its wording. Always prioritize the **squared residuals** when referring to OLS.

**Final Answer:**  
The correct statement is **B** ("OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances"). The assertion that the correct answer is A is likely an error.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the OLS question is option A. Let me start by recalling what OLS stands for—Ordinary Least Squares. I remember that OLS is a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed responses and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. Wait, but the options here are talking about vertical vs. horizontal distances. Hmm. Maybe I need to think more carefully about the differences between vertical and horizontal distances in the context of regression.

The question is asking which statement is true. The options are:

A. OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.

B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances.

C. OLS minimizes the sum of the horizontal distances.

D. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances.

Wait, so actually, I thought OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, which would be option B. But the user says the correct answer is A. That contradicts my initial thought. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or maybe I need to check the definitions again.

Let me start over. In linear regression, we have the model Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where ε is the error term. The OLS method finds the coefficients β0 and β1 that minimize the sum of the squared residuals. The residual is the difference between the observed Y and the predicted Y (which is the vertical distance between the point and the regression line). So the residuals are vertical distances. Therefore, OLS is minimizing the sum of the squares of those vertical distances. That would make option B correct, not A. But the user is saying the correct answer is A. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there is confusion between minimizing the sum of distances versus the sum of squared distances. The question is a bit tricky because it's possible someone might confuse between minimizing the sum of the vertical distances (without squaring) or the sum of their squares. The key point is that OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares, which is option B. So why would the correct answer be A?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where option A is technically incorrect because it's the sum of squares, not just the sum. Let me check the exact wording of the options again. Option A says "sum of the vertical distances" and option B says "sum of the squares". The question is which is true. So OLS does not minimize the sum of the vertical distances, but rather the sum of their squares. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not A. 

Wait a second. Maybe the user made a mistake in their question? Or perhaps there is some nuance here. Let me recall that in some contexts, like geometric interpretations or other types of regression (like LAD - Least Absolute Deviations), they minimize the absolute distances. But OLS is specifically squares. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where it's phrased incorrectly, but the options are as given. Let me think again. The question states "Why the correct answer is A." But according to my understanding, it should be B. Unless there is some confusion in the question's wording. Let me parse the options again:

A. OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances...

B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances...

So OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals (vertical distances squared). Therefore, B is the correct answer. However, if someone forgets the squaring part, they might mistakenly think it's just the sum of distances, but that's not OLS. The question is about which is TRUE concerning OLS. So unless there's a misunderstanding in the question, the correct answer should be B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that is incorrect? Maybe the user has a typo? Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is A, but according to standard definitions, it's B. Therefore, maybe there is a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe vertical distances refer to horizontal distances? Wait, no. In regression, the vertical distance is the error in Y, while horizontal is the error in X, which is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the distance in some other way, but no, in standard OLS, it's vertical distances squared. 

Wait, perhaps the options are translated incorrectly, or there's a confusion between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares. Let me check again:

The user says "Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances..." But according to everything I know, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer is B, not A. Therefore, perhaps there is an error in the question's options or the user's assertion. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about regression but something else? Wait, the question says "concerning OLS estimation". OLS is for regression. Therefore, unless the question is faulty, the correct answer must be B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is A, but they made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused. Wait, perhaps in some contexts people refer to minimizing the sum of distances, but that would be LAD regression, not OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe "distance" here is in the geometric sense. The vertical distance is the residual, and the horizontal would be the error in X. But OLS minimizes vertical residuals. So A is wrong because it's not the sum, it's the sum of squares. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where they consider the "sum" as in any measure, but technically, OLS is squares. So perhaps the correct answer should be B, but the user is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is from a source where they define OLS as minimizing the sum of distances, not squared. But that's non-standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly, where option A says "sum of squares" but it was mistyped. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are different. Wait, let me check again as per the user's question:

The options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

So as per the user's question, the correct answer is A, but according to standard OLS, it's B. Therefore, either the question is wrong, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about OLS? Wait, no, the question is "concerning OLS estimation".

Alternatively, maybe "minimizes the sum" is considered as the same as minimizing the sum of squares? But that's not the case. The method of least squares explicitly squares the residuals. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and "sum" is mistranslated. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a confusion between the OLS and another method. Let me think again.

Suppose someone confuses the vertical distance with the Euclidean distance. But in OLS, it's purely vertical. The horizontal distances would be for something else, like in Deming regression, which considers both X and Y errors. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about minimizing the sum of the absolute values of vertical distances, which would be LAD, but that's not OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick to see if people know that it's the squares, but the options are presented as A to D, and the user is saying that the correct answer is A, which would be wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in stating the correct answer, but wants to know why A is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my understanding. Let me verify with equations.

In OLS, the objective is to minimize:

Sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (β0 + β1 x_i))^2

Each term (y_i - predicted y_i) is the vertical residual, so squaring them and summing gives the sum of squares. Therefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer is B, not A. 

Therefore, I think there must be an error in the user's assertion that the correct answer is A. Unless there is some context where A is correct. Wait, maybe the question is asking about the sum of distances without squaring, but that would not be OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where all options are technically incorrect, but A is the closest? But even so, B is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to another method. For instance, if you didn't square them, then A would be minimizing the sum of vertical distances, which is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that is wrong, but the user is confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a context where the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is considered equivalent to the sum of squares? That doesn't make sense mathematically. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to minimizing the maximum distance, but that's another method. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is with vertical vs. horizontal. Suppose the question is about minimizing horizontal distances, but no, the answer is A. 

Wait, maybe the user is using a different definition where "distance" is in absolute terms but not squared, but that would not be OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a language issue. In some languages, "square" might be mistranslated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants an explanation of why A is correct, but according to standard definitions, it's incorrect. So perhaps the user is confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is A because technically the sum of vertical distances is minimised when you minimize the sum of squares? Wait, not necessarily. Because if you minimize the squares, you are also minimizing the distances in a sense, but they are different. For example, if you have a choice between two points, one where the sum of distances is smaller but sum of squares is larger, the OLS would pick the smaller squares, which might not correspond to the smaller sum. 

Wait, actually, the two are different. The OLS method does not minimize the sum of distances, it minimizes the sum of squares. So they are different objectives. For example, if you have outliers, the sum of squares would be more influenced by them compared to the sum of absolute distances. 

Therefore, in conclusion, the correct answer should be B, not A. Therefore, either the question is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an introductory class where they simplified and said "sum of distances" instead of "sum of squared distances", but that's a common error. If that's the case, then the correct answer according to the question's options would be A, but technically it's B. 

Given that the user is asking why the correct answer is A, perhaps in the context of their question, the options are presented such that A is the answer, but according to standard statistical knowledge, that's incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about regression but another model? Or perhaps the term "vertical distances" refers to something else?

Wait, perhaps the question is about minimizing the Euclidean distance in a different way, but in standard linear regression, the minimized distance is vertical. However, if you were to minimize the horizontal distances, that would be a different model, sometimes called "inverse regression". So, in that case, the horizontal distances would be for a different estimator, not OLS. 

Therefore, OLS is vertical distances, squared. So the correct answer is B. 

Therefore, maybe the user's question has a typo and the correct answer should be B, but they thought it's A, and are confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that is incorrect, and the user is trying to understand why it's marked as A, but actually, it should be B. 

Overall, based on standard definitions, the correct answer is B, so perhaps the user made a mistake. However, the user is asking why it's A, so maybe I should explain that actually, B is correct, and there might be a mistake in the question's answer key. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a nuance I'm missing. Let me think again. Wait, maybe "vertical distances" is being considered as the residuals, so the sum of residuals is technically zero in OLS because of the way it's calculated (one of the properties is that the sum of residuals is zero), but that's not the same as minimizing the sum. Minimizing the sum squared residuals is different from minimizing the absolute sum. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" is technically incorrect, but perhaps the question is phrased ambiguously. Wait, if the question says "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances", but in OLS, the sum of residuals (vertical distances) is zero, which is the minimal possible sum (since residuals can be positive and negative). But that's not the case. Wait, actually the sum of residuals is zero by the first order condition, but the sum of distances (absolute values) is another matter. 

Wait, here's a thought: If you define "distance" as the algebraic value (i.e., signed distance), then the sum of vertical distances would be zero, which is indeed achieved by OLS. But if "distance" is taken as absolute distance (always positive), then the sum is not zero. 

However, in the context of regression, when we talk about minimizing distances, we usually consider the absolute value, but OLS uses squares. So in that case, if the question is referring to signed vertical distances, then the sum is zero, which is indeed the case for OLS, so the minimal sum would be zero, which is achieved. However, that's a bit of a stretch because the problem is the sum can be zero even if it's not the minimal possible in terms of absolute values. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" in a way that the sum is zero, but that's not really minimizing in the sense of making them as small as possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong and the user is confused. 

Given all that, perhaps the user intended to ask why the correct answer is B, but mistyped it as A. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, the term "minimises the sum" is used colloquially to mean the squared sum, but that's not standard. 

In any case, based on standard econometrics and statistics, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, I think there might be an error in the question's provided answer. If the user is certain that the correct answer is A, then perhaps there's a different context or a trick, but I can't think of one. 

Therefore, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is B, and the user might have a mistake in their question. However, if forced to explain why someone might think A is correct, it could be a misunderstanding where they forget the squaring part. So, the key point is that OLS minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances (residuals), not just the sum, so B is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's why:

### Key Explanation:
1. **Definition of OLS**:  
   Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. Its core principle is to **minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed dependent variable values (\(y_i\)) and the predicted values (\(\hat{y}_i\))**. These differences are called **residuals** or **vertical distances** (errors in the \(y\)-direction) between the data points and the regression line.

2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**:  
   - In regression, the **vertical distance** (\(y_i - \hat{y}_i\)) represents the residual error of the model.  
   - The **horizontal distance** (\(x_i - \hat{x}_i\)) refers to errors in the independent variable \(x\), which is unrelated to standard OLS.  
   - OLS specifically focuses on minimizing the **sum of squared vertical distances**, not the sum of horizontal distances or the raw (non-squared) vertical distances.

3. **Why Option B is Correct**:  
   The OLS objective function is:  
   \[
   \min_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2
   \]  
   This explicitly minimizes the **sum of squared vertical distances**. Squaring ensures positive values and penalizes larger errors more heavily, which is a key feature of OLS.

4. **Why Option A is Incorrect**:  
   If OLS minimized the **sum of vertical distances** (without squaring), it would correspond to **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** regression, not OLS. LAD minimizes the sum of absolute residuals, but this is a different method. OLS requires squaring the residuals to ensure mathematical tractability and a unique solution.

5. **Horizontal Distances (Options C and D)**:  
   Minimizing horizontal distances (Options C and D) would involve a different regression technique (e.g., **Deming regression** or **orthogonal regression**), which accounts for errors in both \(x\) and \(y\). Standard OLS does not use these.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B** because OLS explicitly minimizes the **sum of squared vertical distances** (residuals). The confusion likely arises from conflating "sum" with "sum of squares," but OLS requires squaring to ensure optimality and stability. If the question claims A is correct, it contains an error. 

**Final Answer:**  
The correct answer is **B**. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about OLS estimation, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is option A. Let me start by recalling what OLS stands for. OLS is Ordinary Least Squares, right? I remember it's a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed responses in the dataset and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. Wait, but the question is asking about vertical vs horizontal distances. Hmm.

Let me break it down. The options are about minimizing different types of distances: vertical or horizontal, and whether it's the sum of the distances or the sum of their squares. The key here is understanding what exactly OLS is minimizing.

From what I remember, in linear regression, we have a line that we're trying to fit to the data points. The vertical distance from each point to the line is the residual, which is the difference between the observed y-value and the predicted y-value (the y on the line). So, the residual is y_i - ŷ_i. 

OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of these residuals, right? So, that would be the sum of (y_i - ŷ_i)^2 for all data points. Therefore, technically, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Wait, but option B says "sum of the squares of the vertical distances," which would actually align with that. But the user is saying the correct answer is A, which is just the sum of the vertical distances, not the squares. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Hold on, maybe there's a difference between minimizing the sum of vertical distances versus the sum of the squares? The question is which is true concerning OLS. Since OLS is "least squares," that must mean it's the squares. So option B is actually the correct one, not A. But the user states that the correct answer is A, so maybe there's a trick here?

Wait, perhaps there's a wording issue. Let me re-read the options. The options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances...

D. Same as C but squared.

Wait, so OLS is definitely about minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. So why would the answer be A? Maybe the question is a trick question where some people might think it's the sum of distances, not the squares? But no, the standard definition is that OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which are vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not A. 

But the user is saying that the correct answer is A. Maybe there's a mistake in the question? Or perhaps I'm mixing up with another method? Let me think again. Is there another estimation method that minimizes the sum of absolute vertical distances? That's Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) regression, not OLS. So OLS is the squares, LAD is the absolute values. Therefore, B is correct, A is incorrect. 

Hmm, so maybe the question is designed to have a trick where the user is supposed to choose A, but actually that's wrong. Wait, but the user is stating that the correct answer is A, so perhaps there's confusion between the terms. Let me check another angle. 

In some contexts, people might refer to minimizing the sum of the vertical distances, but in reality, OLS uses the squares. So perhaps the question is a common misconception, and the options are testing whether someone knows that it's the squares. If the question says which is TRUE, then B should be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a mistake and the user is confused. Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is A. So according to the user, the correct answer is A, but from my understanding, that's incorrect. Therefore, maybe I need to see if there's any scenario where OLS minimizes the sum of vertical distances rather than the squares. 

Alternatively, perhaps the wording is slightly different. Let me check the exact definitions again. The ordinary least squares estimates are obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. The residual is the vertical distance between the observed y and the predicted y. So, the sum of (y_i - ŷ_i)^2 is minimized. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, if the given options are A through D as stated, then B is correct. Unless there is some other consideration. Wait, but maybe the question is in another context, like minimizing the sum of vertical distances, not the squares? But that's not OLS. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where vertical distances are considered, but not the squares, so someone might think A, but actually B is the correct answer. Maybe the options are meant to test between A and B. But according to the user, the correct answer is A. 

Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again. The question is: "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation?" The options are A to D. 

If the user is certain that the correct answer is A, but according to my knowledge, that's incorrect, then maybe there's a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is being interpreted differently. 

Wait, perhaps "sum of the vertical distances" could be interpreted as the sum of the absolute values, but maybe the question is phrased ambiguously. If it's just the sum of vertical distances, meaning without squaring, then the minimum could be different. But in OLS, we do square them. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the sum of the vertical distances is a term used for the sum of squared residuals? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, and the correct answer is B, but the user is confused. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, perhaps I need to consider if there's a scenario where A is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to OLS as minimizing vertical distances in a non-squared sense, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe in another language, the translation is different? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" is technically incorrect, but "minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances" is correct, so B is correct, but if someone forgets the "squares" part, they might choose A. However, the question is which is TRUE, so B must be correct. 

Therefore, unless there is some other aspect I'm missing. Wait, another thought: in some cases, when people talk about minimizing distances, they might refer to the vertical distances as residuals, so OLS does minimize the squares of those, so again B. 

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the total distance, not the sum of squares? But no, OLS is specifically "least squares", so squares are key. 

Hmm, maybe the question is a typo, and the correct answer should be B, but the user is saying A. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, but since they are asking for an explanation assuming the correct answer is A, maybe they want to know the reasoning why someone might think A is correct, but actually it's B. But the user is saying that the correct answer is A. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that incorrectly states that OLS minimizes the sum of vertical distances, not the squares? That would be a common misconception. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about minimizing the sum of the vertical distances squared, which is B, but maybe in the options, A is just the sum, not the squares, so the user is confused. 

Wait, maybe the question is in another context, like in simple linear regression vs multivariate? No, the principle remains the same. 

Alternatively, maybe "vertical distances" are considered as the squares? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Hmm, I'm confused. Let me check the definitions again. 

The ordinary least squares estimator minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The residual is the difference between the observed y and the predicted y, which is the vertical distance between the data point and the regression line. Therefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. So the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, either the user is mistaken, or the question is incorrect, because according to standard definitions, B is the correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" as a shorthand for the squares, but that's not accurate. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding between "minimizing the sum" versus "minimizing the sum of squares". The problem is that without the squares, the sum could be zero if the line goes through all points, but since it's the sum, you could have negative distances cancelling out. So minimizing the sum of vertical distances (without squaring) is actually different. 

Therefore, the answer must be B. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a different type of regression, like Deming regression which minimizes the sum of the squares of both vertical and horizontal distances? But that's a different method. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the difference between vertical and horizontal, so A and B are about vertical, C and D horizontal. So the vertical ones are the correct direction for OLS, which is the standard regression where y is dependent and x is independent. So OLS does minimize the vertical distances in terms of squares, so B is correct. 

Therefore, unless there's a trick here, the correct answer is B, but the user says A. Maybe the options are mislabeled? If the options were A and C, maybe, but given as is, I think the user might have a mistake here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a mistake. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, maybe I need to explain that actually it should be B, but given the user's premise, perhaps they are confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of an example. Suppose you have a few data points. If you try to minimize the sum of vertical distances, you would take the median of the residuals, but OLS is the mean squared, so different result. 

Therefore, in conclusion, I believe there's an error in the question or the user's assertion. The correct answer should be B, not A. However, if we have to explain why someone might think A is correct, perhaps they forgot the squaring part. But according to standard OLS definition, it's B. 

Wait, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is incorrect, but perhaps in some contexts, "sum" is being used to mean "sum of squares". But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language where the translation is off. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. 

Suppose someone says "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances"—if you interpret "distance" as "squared distance", then technically it's still correct? But no, distance is usually the absolute value. Squared distance would be a different term. 

Alternatively, maybe in some sources, people refer to the residual sum of squares as just "sum of vertical distances", but that's not standard terminology. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to compare vertical vs horizontal, and in that case, OLS does minimize the vertical, not horizontal, but the squares are important. So the answer is between A and B. Since OLS is least squares, B is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick where it says "sum of vertical distances" but they mean the squares. But no, that's not. 

Hmm, I think I need to check a textbook or online source. Let me recall that OLS regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which are the vertical distances between observed y and predicted y. So answer B is correct. 

Therefore, I think the user might have made an error in stating that the correct answer is A. The correct answer should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the answer key is wrong. Since the user is asking why A is correct, maybe they want to confirm if there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding between "sum of the vertical distances" versus "sum of the squares". If someone says "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances", that would be incorrect because OLS uses the squares. Therefore, unless there's a specific context where vertical distances are considered in another way, but I can't think of any. 

Alternatively, maybe in the case of a simple regression line, the line is fitted such that the sum of the residuals (vertical distances) is zero, but that's a property of the OLS estimates, not the objective being minimized. The objective is the sum of squared residuals, not the sum of residuals. The sum of residuals is zero as a result of the minimization, but that's different. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B, so perhaps the user's question is based on an incorrect answer key, or there's a mistake in the options. 

Given that the user is asking why the answer is A, but according to my knowledge, it's B, I might need to point out the discrepancy. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that phrased the options incorrectly. 

In conclusion, based on standard definitions, the correct answer is B. However, if the question insists that A is correct, then there might be an error. Therefore, in my answer, I should explain that OLS minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances, so B is correct, and A is incorrect because it's missing the squaring. Maybe the user made a mistake in the options or the question's source has an error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is in a context where "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is intended to mean the same as "sum of the squares", which would be a terminology issue, but that's unlikely. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that there's a mistake in considering A as correct; it should be B. But the user is asking why A is correct, so I should explain that normally it's B, but perhaps in some cases... no, I think the user might have a mistake here. 

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question where "sum of the vertical distances" is the same as "sum of squares", but no, those are different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to minimizing the vertical distances in a different way, but I can't think of a method that does that. 

Alright, I think I've thought through this thoroughly. The key points are:

- OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares.

- It minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (vertical distances).

- Therefore, option B is correct, not A.

- The confusion comes from whether the question is considering squares or not.

Thus, the user might have a typo or the answer key is wrong, but based on standard knowledge, B is correct.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not **A**. Here's why:

### Key Concepts:
1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** is a method used in linear regression to estimate the parameters of a model. Its defining characteristic is that it minimizes the **sum of the squared residuals** (vertical distances between observed \( y \) values and predicted \( \hat{y} \) values).

2. **Residuals** are the vertical distances between each data point \((x_i, y_i)\) and the regression line. The residual for the \(i^{th}\) point is \( y_i - \hat{y}_i \).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A** states that OLS minimizes the **sum of vertical distances** (i.e., the sum of residuals).  
  - This is **incorrect** because the residuals can cancel each other out (e.g., positive and negative residuals summing to zero), so minimizing their sum is not meaningful. OLS instead minimizes the **sum of squared residuals** to ensure all distances contribute positively to the objective function.

- **Option B** states that OLS minimizes the **sum of the squares of the vertical distances** (i.e., residuals squared).  
  - This is **correct**, as this is precisely what "least squares" refers to. The OLS solution is derived by minimizing the quantity \(\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\).

- **Options C and D** refer to minimizing horizontal distances (between \( x \) values and the line).  
  - These are incorrect for standard OLS, which focuses on vertical distances. Horizontal distances are minimized in different methods like **Deming regression** (for errors in both variables), but not in OLS.

### Why the User Might Think Option A is Correct:
- A common misconception is conflating "minimizing the sum of vertical distances" with OLS. However, OLS explicitly uses squared distances (to prevent cancellation) and thus corresponds to **Option B**.  
- The wording in Option A omits the critical term "squares," leading to confusion. If "sum of vertical distances" were interpreted as the sum of absolute values (not squared), it would describe **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** regression, not OLS.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, not A. Option B aligns with the foundational principle of OLS (minimizing squared residuals), while Option A describes an incorrect formulation. If the question states that A is correct, it likely contains an error. Always verify the distinction between **sum of squared residuals** (OLS) and the **sum of residuals** or **sum of absolute residuals** (other methods). 

**Final Answer:**  
The correct statement is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.** The confusion arises if someone overlooks the "squares" in "ordinary least squares."
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is A for the question about OLS estimation. The options are about minimizing different types of distances between points and the regression line. Let me start by recalling what OLS stands for—Ordinary Least Squares. 

From what I remember, OLS is a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed responses and the responses predicted by the model. Wait, but the options here mention "vertical distances" and "horizontal distances." Hmm, vertical distances would be the residuals, right? The vertical distance from each point to the line is the error term, which is the difference between the actual y-value and the predicted y-value. 

The question is asking which statement is true about OLS. Let me look at the options again. 

Option A says OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances. Option B says it minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Option C is about horizontal distances, and D is the squares of horizontal distances. 

Wait, I thought it was the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Because in OLS, we square the residuals to make them positive and to penalize larger errors more. But the question is saying the answer is A, which is the sum of the vertical distances without squaring. That contradicts what I thought. Maybe I'm confused here. 

Hold on, maybe the question is a trick one. Let me think again. OLS does minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, so that would be B, not A. But the user is saying that the correct answer is A. That must mean I'm missing something. Is there a difference between minimizing the sum of the distances versus the sum of the squares?

Ah, right! If you just take the sum of the vertical distances, without squaring, the problem becomes different. The reason OLS uses squares is that the sum of absolute distances (which is similar to just summing vertical distances without squaring) is another method, called least absolute deviations (LAD), which is less sensitive to outliers. But the question is about OLS, so OLS specifically uses squares. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not A. But according to the user, the correct answer is A. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the options again.

The question states the options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

So the confusion is between A and B. The term "minimizes the sum of vertical distances" is actually not OLS, but the sum of the squares of the vertical distances is OLS. So B is correct. But why would the user say the answer is A? Maybe there's a translation error or a misstatement?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where none of the options are correct except A. But that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, sometimes people refer to "vertical distances" as residuals, so the vertical distance is indeed the error term (y_i - ŷ_i). But OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of those residuals, so it's the squares. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. However, if the question is asking which is true, maybe A is a distractor because someone might think "minimizes the sum of distances" without considering the squares. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to OLS as just minimizing the sum, but technically it's the sum of squares. Maybe the question is wrong? But assuming the user is correct that the answer is A, there must be some misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the term "sum of the vertical distances" actually refers to the sum of squared distances in the wording? But that would be redundant. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording of the options. Let me parse each option carefully. 

Option A: sum of the vertical distances. So that's just sum |e_i|, which is LAD. 

Option B: sum of squares of vertical distances, which is OLS. 

So the question is which is true. The user says the correct answer is A, but that contradicts standard knowledge. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps there's a different interpretation. Wait, maybe "sum of vertical distances" is intended to mean sum of squares? But that's not standard terminology. 

Alternatively, could there be a case where OLS is minimizing the sum, not the sum of squares? No, OLS is defined by minimizing the sum of squares. The name "least squares" refers to the squares. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that has an error? Or maybe the user is confused. Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is A, but according to standard definitions, it should be B. 

Wait, maybe the options are mislabeled? Let me check again. The user says: "Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line?" So according to the user's question, the correct answer is option A, which is the sum of vertical distances. 

Hmm, unless... Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding between vertical vs horizontal. OLS minimizes vertical distances, but in terms of the method, it's the squares. Maybe the question is trying to distinguish between vertical and horizontal, so even though it's the squares, the direction is vertical. 

The other options, C and D, refer to horizontal distances, which would be related to a different method, like when you have errors in variables or Deming regression, which might minimize the sum of squares of horizontal distances if the independent variable has error. 

So the question is about which is true concerning OLS. Since OLS assumes that the independent variable is fixed, the errors are in the dependent variable, hence vertical distances. Therefore, even though we minimize the squares, the direction is vertical. So the true statements would be either A or B. The question is whether the minimization is of the sum (A) or the sum of squares (B). 

So the key is that OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, so B is correct, not A. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bad one, and the options are phrased ambiguously. If "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is the answer, that's incorrect, but if the question is about what it does in terms of direction, then OLS does involve vertical distances rather than horizontal. But the minimization is of the squares. 

Wait, maybe the options are not exclusive? Let me think again. The question is "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation." So more than one could be true? But the user is stating that the correct answer is A, but according to standard OLS, B is true. 

Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps there is a context where A is considered correct. Maybe in some sources they refer to minimizing vertical distances without specifying squares? But that's not accurate. 

Alternatively, maybe "sum of vertical distances" is being used in a different way. Wait, the vertical distance is the residual, so the sum of residuals in OLS is actually zero, because of the properties of OLS (one of the normal equations is the sum of residuals equals zero). Therefore, the sum of vertical distances (without squaring) would be zero, so minimizing it isn't the point. 

Therefore, the correct answer must be B. Maybe the user confused the term? Or is there a different interpretation? 

Alternatively, if the question is from an introductory class where they simplify and just say "OLS minimizes the distance," but technically it's the squares. 

Hmm, given that, perhaps the answer provided by the user is incorrect? Or maybe the question is from a non-English source where "sum of the vertical distances" is meant to imply sum of squares? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where it says "sum of the vertical distances", but in reality, OLS minimizes the sum of squares, so technically, the statement in A is false, and B is true. 

In that case, the user's assertion that the correct answer is A is wrong. But the user is asking why it's A, so perhaps there's confusion here. 

Wait, let me check the terms again. The vertical distance is the residual. The OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals. So the correct answer is B, not A. 

Perhaps the question had a typo and meant to say "sum of the squares of the vertical distances," so B is correct. But if the user is saying A is correct, that's incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and in translation, "sum of the squares" was lost. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are reversed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from an econometrics perspective where they sometimes refer to it as minimizing the sum of residuals squared. 

In any case, based on standard econometric principles, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, the user might have made an error in the question or the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original question had different options, but in the given context, if the correct answer is indeed A, maybe the question is about a different method? 

Wait, if we consider the term "vertical distances" but without squaring, that would be the LAD estimator (least absolute deviations). But the question is about OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the user is confused, but they want to know why it is A, but actually, it should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to the vertical distances as just the distances, implying the squares are already considered? No, that's not standard. 

Therefore, I think there is a mistake in the question's answer provided by the user. The correct answer should be B, not A. 

Wait, but the user is asking why A is correct. So they might be confused. To answer their question, maybe I should explain that actually B is correct, but perhaps the question's options are mislabeled? Or maybe the user is from a source that incorrectly states A as the answer, and I need to point that out. 

Yes, in that case, the user might have a question from a test where the answer is A, but they are confused. So I need to explain that technically, the correct answer is B, and A is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. 

Wait, "sum of the vertical distances" could be interpreted as sum of squared distances? No, because distance usually refers to absolute value. Squared distance is technically different. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, "distance" refers to squared distance? Probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is referring to Pythagorean distances (hypotenuse), but that would be total least squares, which uses both horizontal and vertical distances. 

Alternatively, maybe "vertical distances" are just the errors, and "sum of vertical distances" is the same as sum of squared errors, but that's not accurate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in simple linear regression, the vertical distance is the error, so OLS does minimize the sum of squared vertical distances, so B is correct, but A is incorrect. 

Therefore, I think there's an error in the question stating that A is correct, but actually B is correct. 

Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in transcribing the question or the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, but the options are written differently. But according to the user's statement, the correct answer provided is A, so I need to explain why it's wrong and why B is actually correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-technical source that simplifies the concept, saying "minimizes the distances" without mentioning squares, so A is considered correct in that context. But technically, that's an oversimplification and incorrect. 

Therefore, summarizing: OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (the residuals), so the correct answer should be B. The statement in A is incorrect because it neglects to mention squaring, which is essential for OLS. Therefore, the user might have been given an incorrect answer key where A is marked as correct, but the technically accurate answer is B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different language where the translation led to an error. 

In any case, based on standard econometrics, the answer should be B. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question's provided answer. 

However, since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, I need to address that. Perhaps the question is a trick question, and it's pointing out that OLS deals with vertical distances as opposed to horizontal ones, even though it's about squares. So A is true in the sense that it's vertical, but the minimization is of squares. 

But the statements are about what OLS minimizes. So the options A and B are both about vertical distances, but one includes squaring. Since OLS does not minimize the sum itself, only the sum of squares, then A is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is poorly worded, and "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is a way of saying that it minimizes in the vertical direction, not the horizontal. In that case, both A and B are true statements because B is more precise. But since it's a multiple-choice question, probably only one is correct, so B is the correct answer. 

Therefore, I believe the correct answer should be B, and the user's provided answer is incorrect. 

Wait, but let me check a source. 

[Imagining looking up a textbook or online resource]

According to the definition on Investopedia: "Ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variables (outcome) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function." 

So it's minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences (vertical distances). Therefore, the correct answer is B. 

Another source: Wikipedia says, "The OLS estimator is obtained by minimizing the total squared error... The resulting estimator is called the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator for β."

Therefore, the answer should be B. 

Therefore, the user's question is likely based on an incorrect premise that the correct answer is A. 

So, the answer to the user's question is that the correct answer is actually B, not A. The confusion arises because OLS indeed considers vertical distances (errors in the y-direction), but the key part is that it minimizes their squares, not the distances themselves. The statement in A is incorrect because it omits the squaring, which is central to the OLS method. 

Therefore, the user might have encountered a question with a mistake, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the options. In any case, based on standard definitions, B is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's why:

### Key Points:
1. **OLS Definition**:  
   The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method estimates regression coefficients by minimizing the **sum of the *squares*** of the vertical distances (errors) between observed data points and the regression line. This is the core principle of OLS, as the name "least squares" explicitly refers to minimizing squared differences.

2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**:  
   - Vertical distances correspond to the **errors** (residuals) in the dependent variable \( y \). These are the differences between observed \( y_i \) and predicted \( \hat{y}_i \) values.  
   - Horizontal distances (errors in the independent variable \( x \)) are not minimized by OLS, as OLS assumes \( x \) is measured without error. Methods like Total Least Squares (TLS) minimize distances in both directions, but this is unrelated to OLS.

3. **Why Option B is Correct**:  
   OLS explicitly minimizes the **sum of squared vertical distances** (residuals). This squaring ensures positive residuals are penalized more heavily and avoids cancellation of positive/negative residuals. The resulting equations have unique solutions, unlike minimizing the sum of absolute residuals (LAD regression).

4. **Why Option A is Incorrect**:  
   The un-squared "sum of vertical distances" would refer to minimizing \( \sum |e_i| \), which is the objective of **least absolute deviations (LAD)** regression, *not* OLS. OLS requires squaring the residuals to be mathematically valid and solvable using linear algebra.

### Summary:
- **A** is incorrect because it neglects the critical step of squaring the residuals.  
- **B** is correct as it accurately describes OLS's minimization of squared vertical distances.  
- **C** and **D** are incorrect because minimizing horizontal distances is not part of OLS's objective.

The confusion likely arises from conflating OLS's focus on vertical distances (errors in \( y \)) with the incorrect assumption that the distances themselves (not their squares) are minimized. Always remember: **OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals**, which are vertical distances. 

**Final Answer:** The correct statement is **B**, not A.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about OLS estimation, and I need to figure out why option A is the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about OLS, which stands for Ordinary Least Squares. From what I remember, OLS is a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. The main idea is to find the line that best fits the data points by minimizing some kind of distance between the observed points and the line.

The question lists four options, all of which talk about minimizing different types of distances. Let me parse each one:

A. OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.
B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.
C. OLS minimizes the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.
D. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

Hmm, so the key here is understanding exactly what OLS does. I think I might have confused this with other methods like least absolute deviations or maybe even principal component analysis. Let me think step by step.

First, in linear regression, the model is typically written as Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where ε is the error term. The goal is to estimate β0 and β1 such that the "error" is minimized. Now, the error term ε is often considered to be the vertical distance between the observed Y and the predicted Y (which is on the regression line). So, if we're talking about vertical distances, that would align with the error term in the model.

Now, OLS specifically, as the name suggests, uses the least squares criterion. Squares of the errors, right? So, if we take the vertical distances (the residuals), square them, and then add them all up, OLS finds the line that minimizes that sum. Wait, but the question is asking which is TRUE. Let me check the options again.

Option B says it's the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. But the user is saying the correct answer is A, which is just the sum of the vertical distances. That seems conflicting with my initial thought.

Hold on, maybe I need to verify the exact definition. Let me recall: the OLS estimator minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. The residual is the difference between the observed y and the predicted y, which is exactly the vertical distance. Therefore, the objective function is the sum of (y_i - ŷ_i)^2. So that would mean that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. That would make B the correct answer, not A.

But the user is stating that the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here? Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing?

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares. Let me think again. The standard OLS is definitely minimizing the sum of squared residuals. The vertical distances are the residuals, so their squares are summed. Therefore, B should be correct. Then why is the user saying A is correct?

Wait, maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation. Could "sum of vertical distances" refer to the absolute values? In that case, that would be least absolute deviations, not OLS. So the question is a bit ambiguous. The term "sum of vertical distances" without specifying squares could be either sum of absolute distances or sum of squared distances. But in standard terminology, OLS is about squares. So if the question is distinguishing between A (sum of vertical distances) vs B (sum of squares of vertical distances), then B is correct. However, if the question is phrased as "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances", that would not be OLS—it would be another method. 

Therefore, perhaps there is an error in the question's options? Or maybe the user is mistaken in saying that A is the correct answer?

Alternatively, maybe I got confused between vertical and horizontal? Let me think. In regression, we usually model Y as a function of X, so the vertical distance makes sense as the error. If we minimized horizontal distances, that would be different, perhaps in the case of Deming regression or when both variables are subject to error. But in standard OLS, it's vertical distances, squared.

So, given that, the correct answer should be B. But since the user is saying A is correct, maybe the question is worded differently? Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the options are not about squares? Let me re-read the question.

The user wrote: "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation? The options are: A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line, B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line, C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line, D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line."

Wait, so the question is exactly as presented. Then why is the correct answer A? Because according to my understanding, OLS does minimize the sum of the squares, so B should be the correct answer. But then perhaps the user made a mistake? Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, people refer to it as minimizing the sum of vertical distances, but that would technically be incorrect because OLS uses the squares.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question's wording. Maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is in fact the correct answer if they are considering absolute distances, but then it's not OLS. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different type of regression, but the question explicitly mentions OLS. Let me check a textbook definition to confirm.

Looking up OLS: According to Wikipedia, "The OLS estimator is obtained by minimizing the total squared error... In other words, the formula for the estimate minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances between the observed responses in the dataset and the responses predicted by the linear approximation."

Ah, so the key here is "sum of the squared vertical distances", which would correspond to option B. However, the mention of "vertical distances" is correct, but the squaring is essential. Therefore, if the question is as presented, then B is correct. But the user is saying that the correct answer is A, which would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where "sum of vertical distances" is interpreted differently? Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps there is confusion between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a typo?

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that incorrectly states that A is correct, and the user is confused why that is the case, so they are seeking clarification. So perhaps the user's question is actually to understand why someone might think A is correct, but actually, the correct answer is B. But the user presented it as the correct answer being A, so maybe they are confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a context where they consider "minimizing the sum" as the same as "minimizing the sum of squares", which is not the case. Alternatively, maybe in the question, the options are mislabeled?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different method, but OLS is defined as minimizing the sum of squared residuals, so B should be correct. Therefore, there might be an error in the question's answer key, or perhaps the user is confused, and I need to explain why B is the correct answer instead of A.

Wait, the user is asking, "Why the correct answer is A...", so they are given that A is the correct answer but don't understand why, so they need an explanation. But according to standard knowledge, this is incorrect. Therefore, this might be a case where the question is wrong, but the user is supposed to figure out why the given answer (A) is thought to be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that uses "vertical distances" but actually refers to squared distances, but the wording is ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the term "sum of the vertical distances" is intended to mean the same as the sum of squares? Probably not. Alternatively, maybe the question is in a language where "sum" is sometimes used to mean "sum of squares"? That's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the options are phrased ambiguously. Let me think again.

Option A says "minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line". If you just take the vertical distances (the residuals) and add them up, without squaring, that could lead to overcounting because residuals can be positive and negative, and they might cancel out. Therefore, minimizing the sum would not make sense because you could have a line with residuals cancelling out, but that might not be a good fit. Therefore, usually, people square them so that all terms are positive, and then sum those squares. Therefore, the standard OLS is indeed minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical distances (B), not the sum of the vertical distances (A). Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

Unless the question is considering absolute values instead of squares. If "sum of vertical distances" is interpreted as the sum of absolute values of vertical distances, then that's the least absolute deviations (LAD) method. In that case, A would be incorrect for OLS. Therefore, I think there's an error in the question's options or the provided correct answer (A) is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between "minimizing the sum of squared errors" versus "minimizing the sum of errors squared". Wait, no, those are the same. The sum of squared errors is the same as sum of the squares of the errors.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, people refer to the vertical distances as the residuals and just say "sum of vertical distances" when they mean the sum of squares, but that's non-standard. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a non-standard definition, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken in the question's phrasing? Maybe they intended to present the options differently?

Wait, let me check again the original question as presented by the user:

"Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation? The options are: A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line, B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line, C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line, D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line. Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line?"

Hmm, so the user is saying that the correct answer is A, but according to standard definitions, B should be correct. So perhaps the user is confused, or there's a mistake in their source. Since the user is asking for an explanation of why A is correct, but according to my knowledge, it's not, maybe I should explain that there's an error here, but also clarify the actual correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In OLS, we indeed minimize the sum of squared residuals. The residuals are the vertical distances between the observed points and the line. Therefore, the OLS criterion is the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Therefore, option B is correct, not A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" in a non-technical way, but that would still be incorrect. Maybe the term "minimises the sum" is being confused with "the sum that is minimized", but OLS does not minimize the sum of vertical distances, only the sum of their squares.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to the residuals as "vertical distances" and the term "sum of vertical distances" is a shorthand for the sum of squared vertical distances. But that's not standard.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the vertical and horizontal. If the question had said horizontal, then it would be different. For example, in some cases, like when both variables are considered random, you might use a different method that minimizes the horizontal distances, but that's not OLS. OLS assumes X is fixed, so vertical distances are the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different form of regression, like major axis regression or geometric mean regression, which minimizes the product of horizontal and vertical distances, but that's not OLS.

Alternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording where "minimises the sum" actually refers to the minimum sum, but in absolute terms? However, without squaring, the sum of vertical distances can be minimized by a line that has residuals canceling out, which would not be the best fit. For instance, if you have points with both positive and negative residuals, the sum could be zero even if the line is not the best fit. Therefore, in order to have a meaningful minimization, we need to use absolute values or squares. Since OLS uses squares, B is the correct answer.

Therefore, unless there's a specific context where "sum of vertical distances" is being used in a different way, I think the correct answer should be B. The user might have encountered a mistake in their source, or perhaps they misread the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source where the translation led to an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is tricky in that "sum of vertical distances" is technically correct if you consider that the squares are a type of sum, but that's not accurate. The squares are not part of the distance itself, but rather a way to penalize larger errors more. So the vertical distance is the residual, and the squares are applied to them. So the correct answer is indeed B.

Therefore, I think there might be an error in the question's answer key, but the user is asking why A is the correct answer, so perhaps I need to explain that actually B is correct, and A is incorrect, and maybe point out the confusion.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Key Concepts of OLS:
1. **Objective of OLS**: The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is used to estimate the coefficients of a linear regression model by **minimizing the sum of the squared vertical distances between observed data points and the regression line**. These vertical distances are called **residuals** or **errors**.
2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**: In linear regression, we assume the independent variable (\(X\)) is fixed (non-random), so the error term (\(\epsilon\)) is defined as the vertical deviation between the observed \(Y\) and the predicted \(\hat{Y}\). Thus, OLS focuses on **vertical distances** (errors in the \(Y\) direction).
3. **Squaring the Distances**: Squaring the residuals ensures all terms in the sum are non-negative and penalizes larger errors more heavily (since squaring amplifies them). This is critical for finding a meaningful solution. Minimizing the **sum of the *squares*** of these vertical distances leads to unique and mathematically tractable estimates for the regression coefficients.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: *"OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line"*  
  This is **incorrect** because the sum of *unsquared* vertical distances can be misleading. For example, positive and negative residuals might cancel out, leading to a sum close to zero even if the line is a poor fit. OLS explicitly uses **squared distances** to avoid this issue.

- **Option B**: *"OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line"*  
  This is **correct**. This directly matches the definition of OLS, which minimizes the **sum of squared residuals** (vertical distances squared).

- **Options C and D**: These refer to *horizontal distances* (errors in the \(X\) direction). OLS does **not** minimize horizontal distances because \(X\) is treated as fixed, not random. Methods like Deming regression or major axis regression use horizontal distances, but these are distinct from OLS.

### Why the Confusion?
The question might have intended to highlight that OLS uses **vertical distances** (as opposed to horizontal ones), but it is **essential** to include the **squared** aspect. Option A omits the critical "squares," making it technically incorrect. If the question claims A is correct, it likely contains an error or ambiguity. 

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**. OLS minimizes the **sum of the squares of the vertical distances**, not just the sum of the vertical distances. If the question insists that A is correct, it is likely due to a mistake in the question's phrasing or answer key. Always verify sources for consistency with standard statistical definitions. 

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{B} (assuming the question has a typo and intends to highlight the squared aspect). If forced to choose between the given options as written, **B is correct**, not A.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is A for this OLS question. Let me start by recalling what OLS stands for. OLS is Ordinary Least Squares, right? It's a method used in linear regression to estimate the unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed responses in the dataset and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. Wait, but the options here are a bit different. The question is asking about the vertical or horizontal distances and whether it's the sum or the sum of squares.

Let me break down each option:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.
B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.
C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.
D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

Hmm, so first, I remember that OLS specifically deals with minimizing the sum of the squared residuals. Residuals are the vertical distances between the observed points and the regression line because in the standard linear regression model, we assume that the independent variable (X) is fixed and the dependent variable (Y) has some error. Therefore, the vertical distance makes sense here because we're trying to predict Y based on X. 

Wait, but the options mention "sum" versus "sum of the squares". So option B says sum of squares of vertical distances, which sounds exactly like what OLS does. But the question states that the correct answer is A. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me double-check my understanding.

The key point is that OLS minimizes the sum of the *squared* residuals. So the residuals are the vertical distances, so it's the sum of the squares of those. So that would actually be option B. But the user says the correct answer is A. Wait, that contradicts my understanding. Maybe there's a trick here?

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to test the difference between minimizing the sum of the distances versus the sum of squared distances. Because OLS is about the sum of the squares, not the sum of the distances themselves. So option A is incorrect because it doesn't mention squares, whereas option B is correct. But according to the user, the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the answer is A, but that would be incorrect. Wait, perhaps I need to check definitions again. Let me think step by step.

In linear regression:

- The model is Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where ε is the error term. We want to predict Y given X, so the error is in the Y direction. Therefore, the residuals (the differences between observed Y and predicted Y) are vertical distances.

- The OLS estimator minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which are the squared vertical distances. Therefore, the correct statement should be B, not A. 

But the user says the correct answer is A. That's conflicting. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the options again.

Option A says "minimises the sum of the vertical distances". That would be minimizing the absolute sum, like L1 regression, not OLS. OLS is about minimizing the sum of the squares. So if the question is which is TRUE, then B should be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are misworded? Or perhaps the question is from a non-standard context? Wait, maybe in some contexts, people refer to just minimizing the sum, but actually, OLS is sum of squares. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating that the correct answer is A, but really the answer should be B? Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where A is technically incorrect because it's the sum, not the sum of squares. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an econometrics perspective where they consider the vertical distances but the phrasing is off. Wait, perhaps the options are confusing sum vs sum of squares. Let me think again.

The key is that the vertical distances are the residuals. But OLS minimizes the sum of squares of residuals, so B is correct. However, if someone forgets the "squares" part, they might pick A. But that would be a mistake. 

Wait, maybe the original question had a typo and the user is confused? Alternatively, perhaps in the options, A is supposed to be the correct answer but it's actually wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and "sum" is being mistranslated. Hmm, but assuming the question is in English as presented, then I think the user might be incorrect here. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. 

Vertical distances: residuals are vertical, so yes. The method OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, so that's B. 

Alternatively, could "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" be another term? Wait, if you just sum the vertical distances, that's different from sum of squares. The sum of squares is a different objective function. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. But since the user is saying that the correct answer is A, maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question where A is a true statement but not the best answer? Wait, but the question is "which is TRUE". So if A is false, then it's not the right answer. 

Wait a second, maybe the options are different. Let me check again:

The user wrote:

Options:

A. ...vertical distances... sum

B. ...vertical distances... squares of

C. ...horizontal distances... sum

D. ...horizontal distances... squares of

Therefore, OLS is B, because it's vertical and squares. The question says the correct answer is A, which is not correct. 

Wait, unless there is a misunderstanding in the question. For example, maybe in some contexts, OLS is used without squaring, but that would not be standard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, and the user is confused? Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe someone confuses OLS with another method. For example, minimizing the sum of vertical distances is actually the LAD (least absolute deviations) regression, which is robust regression. So LAD is minimizing the sum of absolute vertical distances, but OLS is squaring them. 

Therefore, the correct answer for OLS is B, but the user says the correct answer is A. Therefore, perhaps the user made an error in stating the correct answer? Or maybe the original question had a different setup?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about minimizing the distance in another way? For example, in geometric terms, sometimes people talk about minimizing the distance perpendicular to the line, but that would be total least squares, which accounts for errors in both X and Y. But OLS is specifically minimizing vertical distances, but squared. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is worded ambiguously. Let me see: the question says "sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line". If you just sum them, that's different from summing their squares. Since OLS uses squares, then B is correct. 

Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the user's assertion that the correct answer is A. Unless the question was phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the options are presented in a different order? Maybe the user mistyped the options? Let me check again.

The user wrote:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

So given that, I think the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, maybe the user is confused, or perhaps the original question had a different answer? Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the vertical distances are actually the residuals, but when you minimize the sum, since the residuals can be positive and negative, the sum might be zero? Wait, that's true. If you just take the sum of vertical distances without squaring, you could have positive and negative distances canceling each other out. Therefore, you can't minimize the sum, but you can take the absolute values or square them. So the sum of vertical distances without squaring isn't a sensible objective because it can be zero even with large errors. Hence, OLS uses the sum of squares. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Therefore, the user might be mistaken in thinking that A is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that says A is correct, but that would be an error. 

Alternatively, the question might have a typo where "sum of the squares" was omitted in the correct answer, but the user is copying it correctly. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to confirm with some sources. 

Looking up OLS: 

Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a method of finding the line (or plane, hyperplane) of best fit for a set of data. It does this by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical (Y) deviations of each point from the line. 

Yes, so B is correct. 

Therefore, if the question states that the correct answer is A, then it's wrong. Unless there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording. Wait, maybe "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is intended to mean the sum of the absolute vertical distances, but phrased ambiguously. But in that case, it's still incorrect, as that would be LAD, not OLS. 

Alternatively, maybe the question considers "sum" as in "sum of squares" but the wording is just "sum" for brevity. But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to check if "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" is technically true in some way? For example, the OLS estimates satisfy the first order conditions, which involve the sum of residuals being zero, but that's different from minimizing the sum. The sum of residuals is zero in OLS, but that's a result of the minimization of the sum of squares, not an objective. 

Therefore, the first order condition is that the sum of residuals is zero, but that's not the same as minimizing the sum of distances. 

Hence, I think the user might have been given incorrect information, or perhaps the question is faulty. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the geometric interpretation, where in some contexts, people might refer to the vertical distances as the residuals and just say "sum" but actually mean squared. But that would be informal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that incorrectly teaches that OLS minimizes the sum (not squared) of vertical distances. That would be an error. 

Therefore, unless there's some other nuance, I think the correct answer should be B, but the user is indicating that A is correct, which is incorrect. 

So, the user is asking why the correct answer is A. To answer their question, I should explain that actually the correct answer is B, and that there might be confusion between the sum versus the sum of squares. 

Alternatively, if the question is correct and the answer is indeed A, then there might be a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing, but that's unlikely. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that the correct answer should be B, but the user might have a mistake in their question's correct answer. However, since the user is asking why A is correct, perhaps I need to explain that there might be a confusion between the terms or a possible error in the question. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different perspective. Let me think again. 

Wait, could there be a case where minimizing the sum of vertical distances (without squaring) is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares? In some cases? Probably not, because the square penalizes larger errors more, leading to different minimization. The only case they would coincide is if all residuals are zero, which is trivial. 

Therefore, they are different objectives. 

Therefore, unless the question is incorrect, the answer should be B. 

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the question is a trick question where A is technically true because the sum of vertical distances is being minimized in some sense. But in reality, OLS doesn't do that. 

Alternatively, the question might be wrong, so the user needs clarification. 

Hmm, since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, perhaps they encountered this question and the provided answer is A, but they are confused. Therefore, my job is to explain that actually, the correct answer is B and that there's a possible mistake in their source. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question's original source, "sum of the vertical distances" is intended to mean sum of squared distances? But that would be incorrect wording. 

Alternatively, perhaps the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is a common misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a student who was taught incorrectly. 

In any case, to answer the user's question: they think the correct answer is A, but the actual correct answer is B. So I need to explain that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased to trick the test-taker into choosing B, but the answer is A. That seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe "sum" here refers to the sum of squared distances, but it's a translation error. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about minimizing the absolute sum, but the user thinks it's OLS. 

But given the standard definition, OLS is about squared distances, so B is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is likely B, and the user might have been given incorrect information. 

So, to answer the user's question directly: The correct answer is actually B, not A. A common misconception is that OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances, but in reality, it minimizes the sum of the squares of these vertical distances. The squared term ensures that both overestimations and underestimations are penalized equally and that smaller errors contribute less to the total error compared to larger ones. 

Therefore, the user might be confused because they were told A is correct, but that's incorrect. The correct answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's an explanation:

### Key Concepts:
1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** is a method used in linear regression to estimate model parameters. The goal is to find the line (or hyperplane) that **best fits the data** by minimizing the **sum of the squared vertical distances** between observed data points and the fitted line. These vertical distances are called *residuals*.
   
2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**: 
   - In regression, we focus on vertical distances because we are modeling the dependent variable (\(Y\)) as a function of the independent variable (\(X\)). The assumption is that \(X\) is fixed or measured without error, and the error is in the \(Y\) direction.
   - Horizontal distances would imply errors in the \(X\) direction, which is not the case in standard OLS.

3. **Sum vs. Sum of Squares**:
   - **"Sum of vertical distances" (Option A)** refers to minimizing the absolute value of residuals (i.e., \( \sum |e_i| \)). This is the objective of **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** regression, not OLS. 
   - **"Sum of squares of vertical distances" (Option B)** is the fundamental principle of OLS: \( \sum e_i^2 \). Squaring ensures that larger errors are penalized more heavily and avoids cancellation of positive/negative residuals in the sum.

### Why Option A is Incorrect:
- If you simply minimize the sum of vertical distances (without squaring), errors above and below the line could cancel each other out, making it an ineffective objective function. 
- OLS explicitly uses squared residuals to ensure stability and differentiability, which is critical for solving the minimization problem analytically.

### Why Option B is Correct:
- OLS minimizes the **sum of squared residuals**, which directly corresponds to minimizing the squared vertical distances between observed points and the regression line. This is the defining characteristic of OLS.

### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:
- **Option C and D (horizontal distances)**: These would be relevant for **total least squares** or errors-in-variables models, where both \(X\) and \(Y\) have measurement errors. Standard OLS does not minimize horizontal distances.
- **Option A (sum of vertical distances)**: As explained, this describes a different method (LAD), not OLS.

### Conclusion:
The **correct answer is B**. If your source claims that A is correct, it likely contains an error or confusion between OLS and alternative regression methods like LAD. Always remember: **OLS minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances**, not the un-squared sum. 

If you encountered this question and were told A is correct, it might be a trick question or a misprint. Always prioritize the **sum of squares** when referring to OLS.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the question about OLS estimation is option A, which says that OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line. Let me start by recalling what I know about OLS, ordinary least squares.

First, I remember that OLS is a method used in linear regression to find the best fit line for a set of data points. The "best fit" part usually refers to minimizing some kind of error or distance. But the question here is specifically about what exactly is being minimized. The options involve vertical vs. horizontal distances and whether it's the sum of the distances or the sum of their squares.

Option A says it's the sum of the vertical distances. Option B is the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Option C is the sum of horizontal distances, and D the squares of horizontal. 

Wait, so maybe I confused something here. Let me think again. I thought OLS minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which are the vertical distances between the observed points and the regression line. So residuals are the vertical differences, right? Because in the standard linear regression model, we have Y = β0 + β1X + error, so the error term is in the Y direction.

Therefore, OLS would be minimizing the sum of squared errors, which are the vertical distances. That would actually point to option B being correct, not A. But the user says the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question? Let me check the wording again. The options are:

A. Minimizes sum of vertical distances.

B. Minimizes sum of squares of vertical distances.

C. Sum of horizontal.

D. Sum of squares of horizontal.

So, if OLS minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances, then B should be correct. But the user states that the correct answer is A. So maybe there's a mistake in the question or the answer? Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit of a trick because sometimes people refer to minimizing the sum of distances versus the sum of squared distances. The key point is that OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals (the vertical distances), not just the sum of the distances. Because if you just minimize the sum of the absolute distances, that's different, that's least absolute deviations, not OLS.

So actually, the correct answer should be B, not A. So maybe there's an error in the question's provided answer? Or maybe the user is confused?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" is considered equivalent? But that's not true. The sum of vertical distances would be different from the sum of their squares. For example, if you have a point far away, the square would penalize it more than the absolute value. OLS is sensitive to outliers because of the squares, whereas absolute would be less so.

Therefore, strictly speaking, B is the correct answer. But the user says the correct answer is A. Hmm. Maybe the question was phrased incorrectly, or maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, let me re-read the user's question again:

"Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line?"

But according to my understanding, that is incorrect. Unless there is some context where OLS does that, but no, OLS is definitely about squares. Unless the question is using "minimises the sum" without specifying squared, but in that case, it's different.

Wait, maybe the question is trying to trick people into choosing B, but the actual correct is A? That seems unlikely. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in stating the correct answer is A, but they actually meant B?

Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled? Like, maybe option A was supposed to be the squares but they wrote it without squares?

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like geometrically, the vertical distances are minimized in another way? But I can't recall that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about minimizing the sum of vertical distances without squaring, but that's not OLS. So perhaps the question is wrong?

Alternatively, maybe I need to double-check definitions.

Let me look up the definition of OLS.

From what I know, OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, which as the name suggests, minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals. Residuals are the difference between observed Y and predicted Y, which is the vertical distance. So the objective function is sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - ŷ_i)^2, which is the sum of squared vertical distances. Therefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, which is option B. So why is the user saying the correct answer is A?

Hmm, perhaps the question was presented incorrectly, maybe a typo? Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that has an error? If the options are as listed, then B should be correct, not A. Therefore, either the user is mistaken, the question is wrong, or maybe there's some other nuance.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in regression, people might refer to the vertical distances as residuals. So maybe someone might say "minimizes the sum of vertical distances" but actually implying squared distances? But no, that would be incorrect terminology.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like when people talk about minimizing the distance without specifying squared, but that's not standard. The term "least squares" is key here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about minimizing the sum of vertical distances, without squaring, but that's not OLS. So if A is the answer, that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different method? Like Deming regression, which minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular distances, or maybe something else. But OLS is specifically vertical.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where none are correct except B, but the user says A. Maybe I should explain why B is correct and A is not.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a test where the answer is A, but that's wrong. Maybe the user is confused?

Alternatively, maybe the question says "TRUE" but actually the options are misworded. Let me check again.

The options are:

A. OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. ... sum of the squares of the vertical distances,

C. sum of horizontal,

D. sum of squares of horizontal.

So, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, unless there's some trick, maybe the question is wrong?

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the term "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances"—maybe in some contexts, people refer to it as just minimizing the sum, but mathematically, OLS uses squares. So, perhaps the answer intended is B, but the question's correct answer is listed as A. That would be a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the options are misworded. Alternatively, the user is confused.

Wait, but the user is asking why the correct answer is A. So perhaps they were told that A is correct, but they want to know why. So I need to explain why perhaps someone might think A is correct, but actually it's B, unless there's some other reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is worded as "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances", and in some contexts, maybe in non-mathematical terms, people might refer to the sum instead of the sum of squares, but technically that's incorrect. So maybe the question has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in some sources, they refer to OLS as minimizing the sum of absolute deviations, but that's another method.

Wait, let me confirm again:

OLS: ordinary least squares. The key is "least squares", so they minimize the sum of squared residuals. The residuals are the vertical distances. So the answer is B.

Therefore, unless the question is incorrect, the user must have a mistake. But since the user is asking why the answer is A, I need to consider if there's a different interpretation.

Another thought: sometimes in simple linear regression, people talk about "vertical distances" as the residuals, but "minimizing the sum of vertical distances" would be different from minimizing the sum of their squares. For example, minimizing the sum (without squares) would involve absolute values, which is different.

Therefore, perhaps the confusion is between sum of absolute deviations (LAD) versus sum of squared deviations (OLS). Since the question says "sum of vertical distances", which is the absolute sum, so that would be LAD, not OLS. Therefore, if the question is correct, then the user's stated answer A is wrong, and B is correct.

But the user is asking why A is the correct answer, so maybe they are confused or the question is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, OLS is called minimizing the vertical distances in a different sense?

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and got mistranslated? Like in some languages, "sum of the squares" might be omitted?

Alternatively, maybe the options are misnumbered? Like, maybe option A was supposed to be B and vice versa?

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken in their assumption. Since the user is asking for the reasoning behind A being correct, perhaps they encountered this in a test and the answer key says A, so they want to understand why that is.

Alternatively, maybe I should explain that technically, the correct answer is B, and A is incorrect, and perhaps the question has an error.

Alternatively, let me think if there's any scenario where OLS can be interpreted as minimizing the sum (not squared) of vertical distances.

Suppose someone says that in the limit or something? No, OLS is explicitly squares. The normal equations are derived from taking derivatives of the squared sum.

Alternatively, maybe in some textbooks, they simplify the explanation and say "minimizes the vertical distances", but that's an oversimplification. The precise term is "sum of squared vertical distances".

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trap for people who confuse vertical vs horizontal, and the answer is actually B, but the user thinks it's A.

Hmm. Since the user is asking for the reasoning why A is correct, perhaps they need to be corrected. But as a helper, I should clarify that actually B is correct, but explain why someone might think A is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to minimizing the sum of vertical distances in a different sense, like without squaring, but that's not OLS.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from an incorrect source, and the correct answer should be B.

Wait, perhaps I need to look up an authoritative source.

According to Wikipedia's entry on Ordinary Least Squares: "The OLS estimator is obtained by minimizing the total squared error, , where is the vertical distance between each point and the line (see the figure on the right)."

So, the key is the total squared error, so the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

Therefore, the user might have an incorrect answer key, or maybe there was a mistake in the question's options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question says "sum of distances" and the user is in a non-technical context where "distance" is considered as squared distance? But that's not standard.

Alternatively, maybe there was a misstatement in the question's options. If the options were reversed, then A would be wrong, but given the options as stated, B is correct.

Therefore, my conclusion is that there's a mistake either in the question's options or in the provided answer. The correct answer should be B, not A. Therefore, the user might have encountered an error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" is considered to mean the same as "minimizes the sum of squares", but that would be incorrect. The terminology is important here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-statistical field where they refer to it differently? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the term "vertical distances" refers to something else?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the residuals, which are the vertical distances, so OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, so that's B.

Therefore, in conclusion, the correct answer should be B, but if the user insists that the answer is A, they might need to double-check the question's wording or the source.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where it says "TRUE" but actually none are true except B, but it's presented as A. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between vertical vs horizontal.

Wait, another angle: sometimes people might confuse OLS with other methods like total least squares, which minimizes the sum of perpendicular distances (which can involve both horizontal and vertical). But in that case, the correct answer would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the options are mislabeled. Maybe the actual correct answer is B, and A is incorrect. Since the user is confused, perhaps they should be informed that the correct answer is B, and that A is incorrect.

But since the user is asking why A is correct, maybe they need to be told that it's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a context where "sum" is considered over all variables, but no, OLS is specifically about vertical.

Hmm. Alright, given that the user is asking why A is correct, but based on my analysis, I can only conclude that the correct answer is B. Therefore, the user might have encountered an error. But since I need to answer as per their question, perhaps I can explain the reasoning for both and point out the discrepancy.

So, in summary:

The correct answer should be B because OLS stands for "Ordinary Least Squares," which explicitly refers to minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (vertical distances). Option A incorrectly states that it's the sum without squaring, which would be a different method (least absolute deviations). Therefore, if the question states that A is correct, it is likely an error. However, if there's a specific context where "minimizes the sum of vertical distances" is intended to mean the squares, that would be unconventional terminology.

Perhaps the question had a typo, and option A should include "squares". Alternatively, the user might have misread the question. Without further information, the standard statistical answer is that B is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **B. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Explanation:
1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** explicitly minimizes the **sum of the squared residuals**.  
   - A residual is the vertical distance between an observed data point \( y_i \) and the predicted value \( \hat{y}_i \) (i.e., \( e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i \)).  
   - The objective function in OLS is:  
     \[
     \text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2.
     \]
   - This is why it is called "least squares"—it minimizes the sum of the **squares** of the vertical distances.

2. **Why Option A is Incorrect**:  
   - Option A claims OLS minimizes the **sum of the vertical distances** (without squaring). This is incorrect because:  
     - Minimizing the *absolute sum of vertical distances* (not squared) is a different method called **least absolute deviations (LAD)**, not OLS.  
     - OLS uses squares to penalize larger errors more heavily, which is critical for its derivation and properties (e.g., best linear unbiased estimator under Gauss-Markov assumptions).

3. **Horizontal Distances (Options C and D)**:  
   - OLS focuses on vertical distances because it assumes errors are in the dependent variable \( y \). Minimizing horizontal distances would imply errors in the independent variable \( x \) (e.g., in **Deming regression**), which is not the case for standard OLS.

### Why the Question Might Be Confusing:
- If the question states that **A is correct**, it is likely an error. The phrasing of **"sum of vertical distances" without specifying squares** misrepresents OLS.  
- The key term in **Ordinary Least Squares** is **"squares"**, not just the sum of distances. Always verify terminology: OLS minimizes the *squared errors* (vertical), not the raw distances.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer should be **B**, not A. The confusion likely arises from omitting "squares" in the description. If the question insists A is correct, it contains a mistake.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about OLS estimation, and the options are about which statement is true. The options are A through D, each talking about minimizing different types of distances. The user is asking why the correct answer is A, but wait, actually looking back, the user says the correct answer is A, but I might need to verify that. Wait, actually, hold on. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation?" The options:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

Wait a second, the user says the correct answer is A, but I thought OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Because OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, right? So "least squares" implies that we are minimizing the squares of the residuals, which are the vertical distances. Hmm, so maybe there's a mistake here. Maybe the correct answer is actually B, not A. Let me think through this carefully.

First, let me recall what OLS is. In linear regression, the ordinary least squares method is used to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed responses (the dependent variables) and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. These differences are called residuals or errors.

So the residual for each data point is the vertical distance between the observed y-value and the predicted y-value on the regression line. Therefore, OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of these vertical distances. That would be option B, not A. But the user says the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe they made a mistake in the question or the options?

Wait, let me check again. The question says, "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning OLS estimation." The options are A through D, with B being about the sum of squares of vertical distances, and A being just the sum. But OLS minimizes the sum of the squares, not just the sum. So actually, B should be the correct answer. Unless there's a trick here.

Wait, maybe there's a difference between "minimizes the sum of the vertical distances" versus "the sum of the squares". The question might be trying to trick you into thinking that minimizing the sum is different from minimizing the sum of squares. But in standard OLS, it's the sum of squares of the vertical distances that is minimized, so B is correct. So perhaps the user's assertion that the correct answer is A is wrong. But maybe they confused something else?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question because in some contexts, people refer to OLS as minimizing the sum of vertical distances, but actually, that's not accurate. Let's confirm with definitions.

In linear regression, the ordinary least squares estimator is the one that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR), where the residuals are the differences between the observed values (y_i) and the predicted values (ŷ_i). Since the predicted values are on the regression line, the residuals are the vertical distances between each point and the line. Therefore, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of those vertical distances. Therefore, the correct statement is B, not A. So either the options are miswritten, or the user has a mistake in their question.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick, because if you just minimize the sum of the vertical distances (without squaring), that's a different method called least absolute deviations (LAD) regression, not OLS. So OLS is specifically about the sum of squared distances. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Wait, perhaps the options are mislabeled? Let me check again. The user wrote:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

So if B is present, then B is correct. But the user says the correct answer is A, which would be incorrect. So maybe there's a mistake in the question? Alternatively, maybe the user is confused, or perhaps there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, people refer to the sum instead of the sum of squares? But that's not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the options are different, but the user transcribed them wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the user is wrong in their assertion that the correct answer is A. Let me see if I can think of any reason why A could be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about minimizing the sum of distances in some other way? Wait, but OLS is always about squares. Unless the question is referring to something else, like maybe in simple linear regression where minimizing the sum of vertical distances might sometimes coincide with the line of best fit? No, that's not the case. The least squares gives a different result compared to least absolute deviations.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering vertical distances but not squared, but in that case, it's not OLS. So if the question is asking which is true, then B is correct. So I think there's an error here. Either the user made a mistake, or the options were presented incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the user's original question had a different correct answer? Let me check again the exact wording. The user says, "Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line?" So the user is stating that the correct answer is A, but according to my knowledge, it should be B. Therefore, there must be something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is worded as "minimizes the sum of the distances" versus "sum of the squares". If someone carelessly reads the options, they might choose A, thinking that "sum" is sufficient, but actually OLS is specifically squares. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, OLS is incorrectly defined as minimizing the sum? That's possible, but that would be a mistake. Let me check a textbook definition. For instance, according to Wikipedia: "The OLS estimator is obtained by minimizing the total squared error, E = Σ_i (y_i - ŷ_i)^2." So that's the sum of squares. Therefore, B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was presented with a typo, and option A is actually supposed to say "sum of squares" but it's missing? Then the correct answer would be A, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, maybe the user is from a non-statistical background and mixed up the terms? In any case, given the standard understanding, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, perhaps the user's question has an error, and the intended correct answer is B, but they thought it was A.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the options are mislabeled? Without more context, it's hard to say, but based on standard statistical knowledge, OLS minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances, so B is correct.

Wait, maybe there's another angle here. The question says "the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line". If the line is in a different direction, like in principal component analysis, which minimizes the sum of perpendicular distances, but OLS is not that. In OLS, it's strictly vertical distances. But in that case, it's still the squares.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about minimizing the sum (without squaring) of vertical distances. In that case, the answer would be A, but that's not OLS, that's another method. Therefore, the question is incorrect if it states that the correct answer is A, because that's not OLS. Therefore, maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question had a different set of options, such that A was correct?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where A is technically correct but B is more precise. But even so, A is incorrect because the sum of vertical distances isn't minimized by OLS; only the sum of their squares is.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a non-English language where terminology is different? Unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a simple case where minimizing the sum of vertical distances coincides with OLS? Not that I can recall. For instance, in the case of one variable, but even then, the solutions are different.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose you have two points (1,1) and (2,3). The OLS line would be the line that minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances. Let's compute.

Suppose the line is y = a + bx. The residuals are (1 - (a + b*1)) and (3 - (a + b*2)). The sum of squares is [ (1 - a - b)^2 + (3 - a - 2b)^2 ]. To minimize this, take derivatives w.r. to a and b and set to zero.

Alternatively, the sum of vertical distances (without squaring) would be |1 - a - b| + |3 - a - 2b|. Minimizing this would give a different line. For instance, if you set up the equations for the LAD estimator, it might not give the same line.

Therefore, in this example, OLS gives a different result than minimizing the sum of vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer is B, not A.

Therefore, the user must have made an error in stating that the correct answer is A. The correct answer is B. Alternatively, perhaps they had different options?

Wait, let me check the original question again. The user says the options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line,

D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.

So according to this, the correct answer is B, not A. Therefore, there is a contradiction here. The user is asking why the correct answer is A, but according to standard knowledge, it's B. Unless there's some context missing.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about linear regression but something else? Like maybe in another context, OLS is defined differently? Not that I'm aware of.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "minimises" in a different sense? Maybe in some contexts, the sum is equivalent? But no, sum of distances and sum of squares are different, and OLS is specifically squares.

Alternatively, maybe the question is old, and in an outdated definition, OLS was considered to minimize the sum? But I don't think so. The term "least squares" has always referred to the sum of squares.

Therefore, I think the user might have made a mistake in their question. The correct answer should be B. Perhaps they confused the question or the options. Alternatively, maybe the question was a trick question where it's a negative, but that's not indicated here.

Alternatively, maybe they are referring to absolute vertical distances, but called them "sum of vertical distances". In that case, it's not squares, but OLS isn't that. So perhaps the question is wrong. Alternatively, maybe they're confusing OLS with another method.

Wait, if the question is from a test where the options are A to D as above, and the correct answer is A, then that would be incorrect. Maybe the test is wrong? Or the user misread the options?

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different context where the horizontal axis is the dependent variable? Wait, in OLS, the dependent variable is on the vertical axis, so if you were to minimize horizontal distances, that would be a different model, like inverse regression. So options C and D are about horizontal distances, which are not OLS, but other methods.

Therefore, in conclusion, the correct answer should be B, but the user is stating that it's A, which is incorrect. Therefore, either there's a mistake in the question's options, or the user is confused. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, I need to explain that actually B is correct, and perhaps the user has an error.

Alternatively, maybe the question says "Which is NOT true" and the answer is A, but the user misread it. Hmm, but that's speculative.

Therefore, to answer the user's question as to why A is correct, I need to point out that actually, it's not correct, and B is the correct answer. The confusion might arise from misunderstanding the difference between sum and sum of squares. OLS is specifically about minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, making B the correct answer. Hence, the user might have encountered an incorrect source or made a typo in the options.

Alternatively, if there is some other context where vertical distances without squaring are minimized by OLS, I can't think of it. Therefore, my conclusion is that there's an error in the question's stated correct answer, and the actual correct answer is B.

But let me see if the user might have a different perspective. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is interpreted as the absolute sum, but sometimes people might refer to the sum as the total distance. But in OLS, it's the squares, not the absolute values. So if the question is about which is true, then A is false because OLS does not minimize the sum, it minimizes the sum of squares. So unless there's a trick, A is incorrect.

Therefore, in summary, the user's assertion that the correct answer is A is incorrect. The correct answer is B. The confusion arises between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares. Since OLS stands for "Ordinary Least Squares," the squares are essential to the definition. Therefore, the correct answer must be B. The question might have a typo, or the user might have transcribed it incorrectly, leading them to believe A is correct when actually it's B.

Alternatively, perhaps in some non-standard usage, someone might refer to the "sum of the vertical distances" as the same as the sum of squares, but that would be a misuse of terminology. The key term in OLS is "squares," so that's crucial.

Therefore, I think the user needs to be informed that the correct answer is B, not A, and that there might be an error in their question's source or their transcription. If they have further context, they might want to check that, but based on standard statistical definitions, B is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not A. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Concepts:
1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** is a method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. By definition, OLS minimizes the **sum of the squared residuals** (errors).
2. **Residuals** are the vertical distances between the observed data points and the regression line. The term "least squares" explicitly refers to squaring these residuals to avoid cancellation of positive and negative errors and to penalize larger deviations more heavily.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A. Incorrect**: OLS does **not** minimize the **sum of the vertical distances** (un-squared). This would be equivalent to "least absolute deviations" (LAD), a different method. OLS specifically uses squared residuals.
- **B. Correct**: OLS minimizes the **sum of the squares of the vertical distances**, aligning with its name ("least squares").
- **C/D. Incorrect**: These involve **horizontal distances**, which are unrelated to standard OLS. Horizontal distance minimization would apply to other methods like inverse regression or principal component analysis (for perpendicular distances).

### Why the Confusion?
- The term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" (Option A) might seem plausible, but it ignores the critical role of **squaring** in the OLS objective function. The method's name itself ("Ordinary **Least Squares**") emphasizes the squared terms, so squaring is central to its definition.

### Conclusion:
The statement in Option B is true because OLS explicitly minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances. Option A is incorrect because it omits the squaring, which is fundamental to the method. If the question states that Option A is correct, there is likely an error in the question or its transcription. Always prioritize the **squared** residuals when referring to OLS.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question here about OLS estimation, and the options are A to D. The question is asking which statement is true. The options are all about what OLS minimizes. Let me see.

First, I remember that OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares. The term "least squares" suggests that it has something to do with minimizing squares. But wait, the options mention vertical distances or horizontal distances. Hmm. Let me think.

In regression analysis, when we talk about the line of best fit using OLS, we're trying to find the line that best predicts the dependent variable (usually Y) based on the independent variable (X). So, the vertical distance from each data point to the line would be the residual, right? The residual is the difference between the actual Y value and the predicted Y value. 

But the question is about whether OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances, the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, or the same but with horizontal distances. 

Wait a second, the key term here is "squares". The OLS method is all about minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. That's the definition. So that would be the vertical distances squared. So maybe the answer is B? Because B says "sum of the squares of the vertical distances", which is exactly what OLS does. 

But the user is saying the correct answer is A. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are A: sum of vertical distances, B: sum of squares of vertical distances. So OLS minimizes the squares, so B should be the correct answer, not A. But according to the user, the correct answer is A. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me recall. The vertical distances are the residuals in the Y direction. If you just minimize the sum of the vertical distances, that would be least absolute deviations, not OLS. OLS is indeed about minimizing the squares. So B is correct. But the user is saying the answer is A. Maybe there's a mistake in the question?

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts people refer to minimizing the sum as opposed to the sum of squares? Let me see.

Wait, the question says "minimises the sum of the vertical distances". That's not OLS. OLS is sum of squared distances. So if the answer is A, that would be incorrect. Unless there's a wording issue here. Maybe the user is mistaken?

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Let me think again. The options are:

A. Minimizes the sum of vertical distances

B. Minimizes the sum of squares of vertical

C. Minimizes sum of horizontal

D. Minimizes sum of squares horizontal

So, OLS is B. So why does the user say the correct answer is A? That can't be right. Unless there was a misprint.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to another method? Maybe in some contexts, people just minimize the sum, but no, standard OLS is definitely sum of squares. Maybe the question is wrong?

Wait, maybe the user made an error in stating the correct answer? Or maybe I missed something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which is a possible true statement, but the options are wrong? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about linear regression? Wait, OLS is for linear regression. So in linear regression, the residuals are the vertical distances, and we minimize their squares, so B is correct. So either the user is confused, or maybe the options are misworded?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick to see if you know that OLS is about squares, so the only true statement would be B, making A incorrect, but the user says the correct answer is A. Hmm. Maybe I need to re-examine the question again.

Wait, perhaps the question says "Which of the following is TRUE", so if all options except B are false, then B is the answer, but user says A is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that's incorrect? Maybe I need to explain why the correct answer is B, but the user is confused?

Wait, the user is actually asking why the correct answer is A, but according to my knowledge, it's B. Maybe they made a mistake in the question?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the vertical distance is the error in Y, which is what OLS minimizes in squared form. But if you just minimize the sum (not squared), that's different. So A is not correct. So maybe the question is wrong? Or maybe there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-linear context? Or maybe in some cases, like simple regression vs multiple?

Wait, no, in any case, OLS always minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which are the vertical distances. So B is correct. So the answer should be B, not A. Therefore, either the user is confused or the question is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is from another country where they use different terms? Like maybe "sum" instead of "sum of squares"? But that's not standard.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased as "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" but they mean in absolute terms? But that's not OLS. So no. Alternatively, maybe "sum" in the sense of total, but squared or not?

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, but according to my understanding, it should be B, so perhaps there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up vertical and horizontal? Wait, in some cases, like in Deming regression, you minimize the sum of squares of the perpendicular distances, but that's not OLS. OLS is specifically minimizing vertical distances squared.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about minimizing the sum (not squared) of vertical distances, which is the LAD estimator, not OLS. So A is incorrect. So the correct answer must be B, but the user says it's A. That's conflicting.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question's wording. Let me parse the options again.

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.

C. Horizontal distances.

D. Squared horizontal.

So, since OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of vertical distances, the correct answer is B, so the user might have an error in their question. Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick someone into choosing B, but the options are wrong?

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually saying "minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations", which is different. But the way it's written, it's just the sum, not the absolute value.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the question's correct answer. Since I need to explain why the correct answer is A, but according to standard knowledge it's B, perhaps the question is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I need to explain why someone might think A is correct but actually B is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the original question had a typo and the user transcribed it wrong. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, people refer to OLS as just minimizing the sum, but that would be incorrect. The term "least squares" is in the name, so it's definitely minimizing the squares.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the user is confused. Since I need to answer their question, which is why the correct answer is A, but actually it should be B, so I should point out that there's a mistake here. But maybe they are from a source that says A is correct, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think again. Let me check some references.

Wait, let's recall the OLS objective function. The OLS estimator minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The residual is the vertical distance between the observed y_i and the predicted ŷ_i. Therefore, the objective is the sum of (y_i - ŷ_i)^2, which is the sum of squares of vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. So A is incorrect because it doesn't mention squares. Therefore, unless the question is wrong, the correct answer is B, but the user is saying it's A. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and the translation is off? But the user wrote the question in English.

Alternatively, perhaps the person who made the question thought that OLS minimizes the sum, not the sum of squares, which is an error. Since OLS is least squares, the squares are essential. The "ordinary" in OLS refers to the fact that it's the basic version as opposed to generalized least squares. So without the squares, it's not OLS.

Therefore, I think the correct answer should be B, so maybe the question or the user is mistaken. However, the user is asking why A is correct, so perhaps there's a different angle here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people refer to the vertical distance as the error term, and maybe in simple terms, they say "minimizes the sum of the distances", but actually meaning the squares. But technically, it's the squares.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where none are correct except B, so the user might have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about minimizing the sum of the vertical distances without squaring, but OLS is not that. So A is incorrect. B is correct. Maybe the user intended B but wrote A as the correct answer.

In any case, given the standard definition, the correct answer should be B, so if the user is saying A is correct, there's an error. But since the user is asking why A is correct, maybe they need an explanation that actually points out that it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps they are confused.

Alternatively, maybe I need to explain that A is incorrect and B is correct. Since the user is perhaps confused, they might have thought that A is correct but in reality it's B. So my job is to clarify.

Wait, perhaps they thought that "minimizes the sum of vertical distances" is the same as minimizing the sum of squared vertical distances, but that's not the case. The sum of distances (without squaring) is different. For instance, minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (LAD) is different from OLS. So OLS specifically uses squares.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, so the user's assertion that the correct answer is A is incorrect. Therefore, the confusion might come from not distinguishing between minimizing the sum versus the sum of squares.

Therefore, in conclusion, the correct answer should be B, and the user might have a mistake in their question. So when explaining, I need to clarify that B is correct, and A is not, unless there's some other context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the options are all incorrect except A, but that's unlikely. The wording says "which is TRUE concerning OLS", so only B is true. Therefore, the user's information is wrong. So maybe they are confused because they remember the term "minimizes the distance" but forgot the "squares".

Therefore, in my answer, I need to explain that the correct answer is B, and A is incorrect. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is A, perhaps they made a mistake, and I should point that out.

Wait, but the user might have a source that says A is correct, so I need to address that. Maybe they are confused between minimizing sum vs sum of squares. Let me structure my answer accordingly.

So, to wrap up, OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (the residuals). Therefore, B is correct. A is incorrect because it omits the squaring. C and D refer to horizontal distances, which are not minimized in OLS unless in a different model like Deming regression, but not OLS. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not A. The user might have an error in their question's answer key, or perhaps a misunderstanding.

Therefore, when explaining, I should clarify that the correct answer is B, and A is not true because OLS requires the squares. If the question says A is correct, that's incorrect, and perhaps point out that maybe there was a typo or confusion in the question.

**Final Answer**
The correct answer is actually \boxed{B}. OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line. The confusion might arise because OLS focuses on minimizing the squared residuals (vertical distances), not the absolute distances. Therefore, statement A is incorrect, while statement B is true. If the question states that A is correct, it likely contains an error.

\boxed{B}
</think>

The question asks which statement is true concerning OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimation. The options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line.  
B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.  
C. OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.  
D. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.  

### Key Points:
1. **OLS Definition**: OLS is a method that estimates the parameters of a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. Residuals are the vertical distances between the observed values (\(y_i\)) and the predicted values (\(\hat{y}_i\)).
2. **Vertical vs. Horizontal Distances**: 
   - Vertical distances refer to the differences in the dependent variable (Y-axis), which are what OLS explicitly minimizes in squared form.
   - Horizontal distances (X-axis) are not minimized by OLS unless in other models like Deming regression, which is not the case here.
3. **Sum vs. Sum of Squares**:
   - Minimizing the sum of vertical distances (without squaring) would correspond to least absolute deviations (LAD), not OLS.
   - OLS specifically minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances to ensure a unique solution and to penalize larger residuals more heavily.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A** is incorrect because OLS does not minimize the sum of vertical distances; it minimizes the sum of their squares.
- **Option B** is correct because OLS indeed minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (residuals).
- **Options C and D** are incorrect because OLS does not consider horizontal distances.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as OLS is defined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. The confusion might arise from mistaking "sum" for "sum of squares" or misunderstanding the purpose of squaring in the OLS objective function. 

### Final Answer
\boxed{B}
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about OLS estimation, and the options are about which statement is true. The choices are between minimizing vertical distances, squared vertical distances, horizontal distances, or squared horizontal distances. The user says the correct answer is A, but wait, I thought OLS was about minimizing the sum of squared residuals, which are vertical distances squared. Hmm, maybe I need to think this through carefully.

First, let me recall what OLS stands for. OLS is Ordinary Least Squares. The key term here is "least squares," which I remember means that it minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals. The residuals are the differences between the observed values and the predicted values, right? Those residuals are the vertical distances from the data points to the regression line because in linear regression, we're predicting the dependent variable (y) based on the independent variable(s) (x). So, the vertical distance is the error in the y-direction.

Looking at the options: Option A says "sum of the vertical distances," while Option B says "sum of the squares of the vertical distances." If OLS uses least squares, then it should be B, right? But the user is saying the correct answer is A. That contradicts what I thought. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question? Let me check again. The question asks which statement is TRUE. Let's go through each option:

A. Minimizes the sum of the vertical distances: That would be minimizing the absolute sum of residuals, which is actually what LAD (Least Absolute Deviations) regression does, not OLS.

B. Minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances: This sounds correct because OLS is about squares of residuals (vertical distances), so the sum of squares is minimized here. So B should be correct.

C. Minimizes the horizontal distances: That would be if we were regressing x on y, but even then, unless there's some other method. But OLS typically is y on x, so horizontal distances aren't minimized here.

D. Minimizes the sum of squares of horizontal distances: Again, similar to C, but squared. Probably not OLS.

Wait, so why does the user say the correct answer is A? Maybe the question is a bit ambiguous? Let me confirm OLS's exact definition. 

OLS estimates are indeed the ones that minimize the sum of squared residuals, where residuals are the vertical distances. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not A. Option A would be minimizing the absolute vertical distances, which is not OLS. 

Is there any chance that the question is worded incorrectly? Maybe in the original question, there was a typo, or maybe the user is mistaken. Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding between "sum" and "sum of squares"? Because if the question were asking for the method that minimizes the sum of absolute vertical distances, then A would be correct. But OLS is specifically squares, not the sum. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused between the terms. Wait, maybe the options are different? Let me check again. The options are:

A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line,

B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances,

C. Minimises the horizontal distances,

D. Minimises the squares of horizontal distances.

Therefore, according to standard definitions, B should be correct, not A. Unless there's some non-standard definition here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a context where they refer to "sum" as the sum squared? Unlikely. Hmm. Wait, maybe in some sources do they refer to the sum as the sum of the distances, but implicitly squared? That seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in stating the correct answer? Because I'm pretty sure OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals (so B), not the sum of residuals (which would be A). 

Wait, but in some contexts, people might refer to the vertical distances as residuals. So the vertical distances are the residuals, but the method is about the squares. So, if OLS minimizes the sum of squares of vertical distances, then B is correct. The sum of vertical distances (without squaring) is not the same as the sum of the squares. 

Therefore, unless there's some confusion in the question's wording, the correct answer should be B. But according to the user, the correct answer is A. That's conflicting. Maybe I need to check again.

Alternatively, maybe the term "minimises the sum of the vertical distances" is a trick because technically, minimizing the sum could be interpreted as the sum of the absolute values, but maybe the question is considering that distances can be signed and thus sum to zero? No, because distances are absolute, so the sum can't be negative. But in OLS, we square them to make them positive, so even if the residuals could be negative, squaring removes the sign. So the sum of vertical distances would be sum of |e_i|, and sum of squared is sum(e_i^2). 

Therefore, if the question is from someone who is confused between the two, then perhaps the user is mistaken. Or perhaps the original question had a typo, such as maybe "sum" instead of "sum of squares".

Alternatively, maybe in the question options, the correct answer is B, but the user says A. So maybe the user is wrong. 

Wait, the original question says "Why the correct answer is A. OLS minimises the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line?" But according to standard econometrics, the answer should be B. So perhaps the user is confused, or the question is faulty. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-technical source? Or maybe in some contexts, people refer to OLS as minimizing vertical distances, ignoring the squaring? That would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different type of regression where direction matters? For example, sometimes in errors-in-variables models, you might minimize the perpendicular distances, but that's different. Or maybe in geometric terms, but OLS is specifically about vertical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a context where "sum" is being used in a different way. Wait, in OLS, the "sum of squares" is minimized, so the answer is B. Therefore, the user's assertion that A is correct is incorrect. 

Therefore, maybe there's an error in the user's premise. The correct answer should be B, not A. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was phrased as "Which is NOT true" and the user got confused, but the question says "is TRUE". 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer key is wrong, so the user is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to explain why B is correct, and A is incorrect, so that the user can see that their original thought that the answer is A is wrong. 

Therefore, the user might have thought that because it's vertical distances, so A is correct, but actually it's the squares. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that the correct answer should be B, not A. The user is mistaken, perhaps because they overlooked the "squares" part. Therefore, the explanation would be that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (the residuals), hence B is correct, not A.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line**, not option A. Here's why:

### Key Explanation:
1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** explicitly minimizes the **sum of the squares of the residuals** (vertical distances between observed \( y \)-values and predicted \( \hat{y} \)-values). The term "least squares" directly refers to this criterion.  
   - Mathematically, the OLS objective function is:  
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \quad \text{(sum of squared vertical distances)}.
     \]

2. **Option A** incorrectly states that OLS minimizes the **sum of vertical distances** (without squaring). This describes **Least Absolute Deviations (LAD)** regression, not OLS. The sum of absolute vertical distances is minimized in LAD, but OLS always uses squared distances.

3. **Options C and D** refer to horizontal distances, which are unrelated to standard OLS. Horizontal distances would be minimized in a regression of \( x \) on \( y \) (reverse regression), but OLS is designed for \( y \) on \( x \).

### Why Option A is Incorrect:
- The vertical distances (residuals) can be positive or negative. Taking their simple sum would cancel out positive and negative residuals, making it an ineffective criterion. Squaring the residuals ensures all terms are positive and penalizes larger errors more heavily, leading to a well-defined optimization problem for OLS.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, not A. The confusion likely arises from conflating "vertical distances" (correct direction for residuals in OLS) with the critical detail of **squaring** those distances, which is central to the method. Always remember: **OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals**, not the sum of residuals themselves.
