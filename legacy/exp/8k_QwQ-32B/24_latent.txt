There is a multiple-choice question: Assume that any assignment statement can be executed in unit time. If as many identical processors as needed are used, what is the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments
A := B + C
B := A - B
C := A * E
D := A/F
E := B - C
F := A + B
with the same result as if the assignments were executed in the order shown?. The options are: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. Why the correct answer is B. 2?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this question here about parallelizing some assignment statements with as many processors as needed. The goal is to find the minimum number of time units required to execute all the assignments while getting the same result as if they were done in order. The options are A through D, and the correct answer is supposed to be B, which is 2. Hmm, I need to figure out why it's 2 and not something else. Let me start by writing down the assignments again to have them clear:

1. A := B + C  
2. B := A - B  
3. C := A * E  
4. D := A/F  
5. E := B - C  
6. F := A + B  

Alright, so first, I should think about dependencies between these statements. Since each assignment depends on variables that might have been computed by previous statements, we need to determine which ones can be done in parallel without violating their dependencies.

Let me list out each statement's dependencies:

1. A := B + C  
   - Depends on B and C, which are initial values, so no dependencies on other statements. So this can be done in the first time unit? Or wait, but actually, if B and C are variables that haven't been modified yet, maybe they are initial values, so this first assignment can be started immediately. 

2. B := A - B  
   - This depends on A (from statement 1) and B (which is the original B before any changes). Since B is being assigned here, the original B is needed. So this can't start until after statement 1 is done because A comes from statement 1. So statement 2 must wait for statement 1 to finish.

3. C := A * E  
   - This depends on A (from statement 1) and E. E is computed in statement 5, so we can't do statement 3 until statement 5 is done? Wait, but statement 5 is E := B - C, which depends on B (original?) and C (the original? Or the updated C?). Wait, hold on, this might be tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, the order of execution is given as the order shown, so in sequential order, each assignment uses the previous assignments' results where applicable. So in the original sequence, each assignment is done one after another, so for example, when executing statement 2 (B := A - B), the A here is the result from statement 1, and the B is the original B before any changes. Then statement 3 (C := A * E) uses the A from statement 1, but E is computed in statement 5, which is later. Wait, but in the original order, statement 5 comes after statement 3? Wait no, let's check again:

Wait the order is 1 to 6:

1. A  
2. B  
3. C  
4. D  
5. E  
6. F  

Alright the order is 1 to 6:

1. A  
2. B  
3. C  
4. D  
5. E  
6. F  

Thus the order is 1 to 6:

1. A  
2. B  
3. C  
4. D  
5. E  
6. F
