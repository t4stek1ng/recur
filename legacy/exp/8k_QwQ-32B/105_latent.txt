The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one being irradiated with UV light, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with palladium on carbon under hydrogen, giving product 2. The question is about the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the 1H NMR of product 2. The answer is supposed to be a doublet, but I need to figure out why.

First, I need to recall what bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one looks like. The bicyclo part means it has two rings, each with two carbons, but let me visualize it properly. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three rings with each bridge being two carbons, right? So the structure is like a cage, maybe similar to adamantane? Wait, adamantane is bicyclo[3.3.1]octane, so this must be a different bicyclic system. Let me draw it mentally: each subscript in the bracket refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.2] would have three bridges each with two carbons. Hmm, actually, maybe it's like a cube? Or perhaps the structure is more like two fused rings with each bridge having two carbons. Wait, maybe it's like a three-membered ring connected to two other rings? I might need to be precise here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the numbering. The starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. The -2-one means the ketone is at position 2. So the ketone group is on the second carbon of the bicyclo system. Let me try to sketch this mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane would have 8 carbons arranged in a way that each bridge has two carbons. So, the structure is actually a cube-like structure, but how exactly?

Alternatively, maybe it's like three rings each with three carbons? Wait, no, the numbering in the bracket refers to the number of methylene groups in each bridge. Let me recall: bicyclo[n.m.k] indicates the number of carbon atoms in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each 2 carbons. So connecting three carbons with each having two carbons between them? Wait, actually, the total number of atoms in the rings is 2+2+2 + 1 (the common carbon)? Hmm, maybe I should look up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like this: imagine a central carbon connected to three methylene groups, each forming a bridge? Wait, maybe it's similar to norbornane but with all bridges the same. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, so this is a larger ring. Let's see. The molecular formula of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane is C8H12. The ketone would replace an H on the 2 position with a carbonyl group, so the starting material is C8H12O (since ketones have a carbonyl). The product 1 has the same molecular weight, so whatever reaction occurs under UV light must not add or remove atoms. So possibly a photochemical reaction like a [2+2] cycloaddition or something that rearranges the double bonds?

Wait, the starting material is a ketone. Maybe under UV light, it undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition? But where would that happen? Let me think. The ketone group has a π bond, so maybe the π bond can participate in a photochemical reaction. Alternatively, maybe the carbon skeleton undergoes a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone group is involved in forming a new ring via a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the bicyclo system undergoes some ring opening? But the molecular weight stays the same, so it can't be adding a new oxygen. Wait, the question states that product 1's molecular weight is the same as the starting material, so no addition, just rearrangement. So maybe the ketone undergoes a rearrangement like a pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement? But that usually involves protonation and then a rearrangement with an acid.

Alternatively, under UV light, maybe the carbonyl group undergoes some rearrangement or a photochemical Norrish reaction. Norrish type I involves cleavage of a α-C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl, forming a ketene and an alkene. Let me think. For Norrish I, the carbonyl would need adjacent bonds that can break. In bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, the ketone is at position 2. The structure has a bridgehead carbon at position 2? Wait, maybe the ketone is on a bridgehead? Bridgehead carbons can't have substituents because of the strain, but in a ketone, it would need two bonds to oxygen. Wait, actually bridgehead carbons can have substituents, but they are generally strained. Hmm, maybe this is possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [1,5] hydrogen shift? Let me think. The ketone's carbonyl is at carbon 2. If under UV light, an electron is excited, maybe it can form a biradical or something that allows a ring closure. For instance, maybe the ketone undergoes a [4π] electrocyclic ring opening? Wait, but that would change the double bonds. Alternatively, maybe the ketone can form a new ring via some rearrangement, leading to a different cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition between the carbonyl π bond and another alkene. But does the starting material have a double bond? No, it's a ketone, so the only π bond is the carbonyl. So maybe it can't do a [2+2] unless another double bond is formed. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl group can react with another part of the molecule. Maybe the UV light causes a rearrangement of the carbonyl group's position?

Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes a retro-aldol reaction, breaking a bond adjacent to the carbonyl. But without acid or base, and under UV light, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? But that usually involves an ester or enol ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material, upon irradiation, undergoes a sigmatropic rearrangement. For instance, a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, like the Cope rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement requires a conjugated diene. Wait, the starting material has a ketone, which has a π bond. Maybe the structure allows for a conjugated diene if there's another double bond. But the starting material is an octan-2-one, so unless there's a double bond elsewhere, it won't have a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is involved in forming a new double bond when rearranging. Let me think again. Let me try to draw the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. Let's see:

The bicyclo[2.2.2] octane has a structure where three rings are interconnected. Each bridge has two carbons. The numbering is such that the ketone is on carbon 2. Let me try to assign numbers. The central carbon (maybe carbon 1?) connected to three bridge carbons. Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. 

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition between the carbonyl π bond and another alkene. But does the starting material have a double bond? No, it's a ketone, so the only π bond is the carbonyl. So maybe it's a Norrish type II cleavage? Wait do a [2+2] unless another double bond is formed. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl group can react with another part of the molecule. Maybe the UV light causes a rearrangement of the carbonyl group's position?

Originally, maybe the ketone undergoes a retro-aldol reaction, breaking a bond adjacent to the carbonyl. But without acid or base, and under UV light, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? But that usually involves an ester or enol ether.

The bicyclo[2.2.2] octane has a structure where three rings are interconnected. Each bridge has two carbons. The numbering is such that the ketone is on carbon 2. Let me try to approach this systematically to assign numbers. The central carbon (maybe carbon 1?) connected to three bridge carbons. Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane.
