You want to quantify the upregulation of a transcript from the mouse hypertrophic muscles and compare it to the levels in the wild-type using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. You isolate the tissues and carefully prepare the RNA for the cDNA synthesis. You proceed with the qPCR in a two-step process. For the second step, you need to design a pair of primers that would allow for the specific detection of the transcript in question. You identified the transcript's genomic sequence that is 23.7 kb long. The ATG is at 6867 bp, following a 128 bp 5'UTR that stretches over an intron. The second exon ends at 8272 bp. There are three more exons; the last exon contains the stop at 23276 bp and is around 500 bp long. Between the second and the third is the gene's largest intron of 7367bp in length. The third is the largest exon, 2126 bp long.
Considering their length of 20 bp and an appropriate annealing temperature, how do you position your primer pair for optimal transcript quantification?
Why the correct answer is forward around 6900 bp and reverse around 8200 bp on the genomic DNA?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I need to figure out where to place the primers for qPCR to quantify the upregulation of this specific transcript in hypertrophic muscles compared to wild-type. Let me start by recalling some basics. For qPCR, you want primers that specifically amplify the target cDNA, right? They should be within exons, so that they don't amplify genomic DNA. Also, the primers should flank an exon-exon junction to avoid amplifying any contaminating genomic DNA. That makes sense because if there's an intron between the primers, the genomic DNA won't be amplified since the primers can't anneal across the intron. 

The transcript's genomic sequence is 23.7 kb long, but the gene has several exons and introns. Let me parse the details given. The ATG start codon is at 6867 bp, following a 128 bp 5'UTR. The 5'UTR is over an intron, so that means the first exon is the 5'UTR? Wait, no, the 5'UTR is 128 bp, and it's spanning an intron. Hmm, maybe the first exon is part of the UTR and then there's an intron before the second exon? Let me think again. The ATG is at 6867 bp. The 5'UTR is 128 bp long, so that would be from 6867 - 128 = 6739 bp up to 6867 bp? Wait, but the 5'UTR is before the start codon, so maybe the coordinates are from 6739 to 6867? But the problem says the 5'UTR stretches over an intron. So perhaps the first exon is part of the UTR, then an intron, and the second exon continues the UTR? Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try to outline the exons and introns as per the problem statement.

The first exon ends at 8272 bp? Wait, no. Let me read again. The second exon ends at 8272 bp. The second exon starts after the first exon. The first exon is before that. The 5'UTR is 128 bp, followed by the ATG, so the start codon is at 6867. The 5'UTR must be part of the first exon? Wait, maybe the first exon is the 5'UTR and the start codon. But the problem says the 5'UTR is over an intron. Hmm, maybe the first exon is the 5'UTR's first part, then an intron, and the second exon contains the remaining UTR and the start codon? That would mean the UTR is split between two exons. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first exon is the 5'UTR and the start codon? But the problem states that the 5'UTR stretches over an intron. So the UTR is split between two exons. Therefore, the first exon must be part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon starts with the remaining UTR and the ATG. Let me try to structure this:

- The entire transcript starts with a 5'UTR of 128 bp. The ATG is at 6867. So the 5'UTR is from position X to 6867. The problem says the 5'UTR is "following a 128 bp 5'UTR that stretches over an intron." Wait, maybe the wording is that the UTR is over an intron, so the UTR is split by an intron. Therefore, the first exon would be part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon continues the UTR and the start codon. 

Therefore, the first exon ends before the first intron. The second exon starts with the remaining UTR and the start codon. Let me see:

The second exon ends at 8272 bp. The ATG is at 6867. Let's assume the second exon starts at position after the first intron. So maybe the first exon is the first part of the UTR (say, up to position 6867 minus the UTR length?), but this is getting confusing. Let me try to map the exons step by step.

The problem states:

- The transcript is 23.7 kb (23700 bp) in genomic sequence. 

- The ATG is at position 6867. The 5'UTR is 128 bp, so the UTR is from position (6867 - 128) = 6739 to 6867.

- The second exon ends at 8272. 

- Between the second and third exons is an intron of 7367 bp. The third exon is the largest, 2126 bp. 

- The last exon (fourth or fifth?) has the stop codon at 23276, which is around 500 bp long. 

Wait, there are three more exons after the second, making a total of five exons? Let me parse again:

The problem says:

"The second exon ends at 8272 bp. There are three more exons; the last exon contains the stop at 23276 bp and is around 500 bp long. Between the second and the third is the gene's largest intron of 7367 bp in length. The third is the largest exon, 2126 bp long."

So the structure is:

Exon1: ?

Exon2: ends at 8272.

Between exon2 and exon3 is a large intron (7367bp).

Exon3 is the largest, 2126 bp.

Then there are two more exons (since it says "three more exons" after the second, so total exons would be 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 3 more = 5 exons? Wait, no. Wait the first exon is before the second, so the count is first, second, third, fourth, fifth? Not sure. Let's see:

Starting with exon1, then exon2 ends at 8272. Next is exon3, which is after an intron of 7367. So the third exon starts at 8272 +1 (end of exon2 is 8272, so next is start of intron, then the third exon starts after the 7367bp intron. So the third exon starts at 8272 + 7367 +1? Wait, maybe the intron length is 7367, so the third exon starts at 8272 + 7367 +1? Let's not get bogged down here. The key point is the exons.

The third exon is 2126 bp long. Then there are two more exons (since three more after the second, so third, fourth, fifth?), and the last exon (the fifth?) contains the stop at 23276 and is ~500bp. 

The goal is to design primers for qPCR. Since we want to detect the transcript (cDNA) and not genomic DNA, primers should span an exon-exon junction. Also, the primers should be within exons so that they don't prime in the intron regions.

So, to design primers that cross an exon-exon junction, we need to have the forward primer in one exon and the reverse in another, with an intron between them. That way, genomic DNA won't be amplified because the primers can't span the intron.

Alternatively, if both primers are in the same exon, then genomic DNA would also be amplified, so that's bad. Hence, the primers need to flank an intron.

Now, the question is where exactly to place them. The user says the correct positions are forward around 6900 and reverse around 8200 on genomic DNA. Let me see why.

Given the exons:

The second exon ends at 8272, so the second exon's end is at position 8272. The first exon's end would be before that. Let's try to figure out the exons' coordinates.

The first exon is before the second exon. The 5'UTR is 128 bp long, so that's before the ATG at 6867. So the UTR is from 6867-128=6739 to 6867. So the first exon must cover at least part of the UTR. Since the UTR is over an intron, the first exon might be up to an intron, then another exon. Wait, the problem states the 5'UTR "stretches over an intron," meaning it is split between two exons. So the first exon has part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon continues the UTR and the ATG.

So first exon ends before the first intron. Let's assume the first exon ends, say, at position X, then an intron, then the second exon starts at X +1 (but after the intron). The second exon includes the remaining UTR and the start codon at 6867, and ends at 8272.

Therefore, the second exon starts at some position after the first intron, and ends at 8272. The first exon must be before that.

Wait, perhaps the first exon is the first part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon continues the UTR and includes the start codon, and the second exon ends at 8272. So the second exon includes the start codon (ATG at 6867) and continues up to 8272. Then between the second and third exons is a large intron.

Therefore, the second exon spans from (say) the start after the first intron up to 8272. The third exon starts at 8272 + 1 + 7367 (since the intron between second and third is 7367). Wait, the intron between exon2 and exon3 is 7367. So the third exon starts at 8272 + 7367 +1? Let me see:

Exon2 ends at 8272. Then the next is an intron of 7367, so the first base of exon3 would be 8272 + 7367 +1 = 8273 +7367 = 15640? Maybe.

Now, perhaps the first exon is the first part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon continues the UTR and includes the start codon, and the second exon ends at 8272. So the second exon includes the start codon (ATG at 6867) and continues up to 8272. Then between the second and third exons is a large intron.

First, the second exon spans from (say) the start after the first intron up to 8272. The third exon starts at 8272 + 1 + 7367 (since the intron between second and third is 7367). Wait, the intron between exon2 and exon3 is 7367. So the third exon starts at 8272 + 7367 +1? Let me see where those positions are:

Exon2 ends at 8272. Then the next is an intron of 7367, so the first base of exon3 would be 8272 + 7367 +1 = 8273 +7367 = 15640? Maybe.

Additionally, perhaps the first exon is the first part of the UTR, then an intron, then the second exon continues the UTR and includes the start codon, and the second exon ends at 8272. So the second exon includes the start codon (ATG at 6867) and continues up to 8272. Then between the second and third exons is a large intron.

Wait, the second exon spans from (say) the start after the first intron up to 8272. The third exon starts at 8272 + 1 + 7367 (since the intron between second and third is 7367). Wait, the intron between exon2 and exon3 is 7367. So the third exon starts at 8272 + 7367 +1? Let me outline the exons based on the info given:

Exon2 ends at 8272. Then the next is an intron of 7367, so the first base of exon3 would be 8272 + 7367 +1 = 8273 +7367 = 15640? Maybe.
