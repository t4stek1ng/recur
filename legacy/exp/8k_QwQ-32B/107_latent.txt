In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.
Why the correct answer is A = two ; B = 77.77 %?<|im_end|>

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand all the parts of the question and figure out why the answers are A = two and B = 77.77%. 

Starting with the first part: why A is two? The question mentions that after heating benzoic acid with ethanol and an acid catalyst for two hours, a TLC analysis was done and they saw A spots under UV light. They mention the presence of starting material (benzoic acid), product, and solvent. But under UV light, how many spots would you expect?

Hmm, TLC shows spots based on different components in the mixture. The solvent might not show a spot if it's the eluent, unless it's fluorescent itself. But usually, solvents don't show up as spots under UV, right? So maybe the solvent isn't contributing a spot. Then the starting material is benzoic acid, and the product would be... what? 

Wait, benzoic acid reacting with ethanol under acid catalysis. That's an esterification reaction. The product would be ethyl benzoate, right? So the starting materials are benzoic acid and ethanol, but ethanol is a solvent here, so maybe they didn't mention it in the spots. The reaction is between benzoic acid and ethanol. So the product is ethyl benzoate. 

In TLC, each compound that has a different Rf value will show a distinct spot. So if the reaction mixture contains both the starting material (benzoic acid) and the product (ethyl benzoate), those would be two different spots. The solvent might not show a spot because it's the eluent, so the solvent front is just the line where the solvent reached, but the actual components that stay on the plate are the benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate. 

Therefore, under UV light, there should be two spots. That makes sense. Maybe the solvent isn't leaving a spot, so A is two. 

Now for part B, the percentage yield being 77.77%. Let's see. The students started with 10 g of benzoic acid. The product is ethyl benzoate. They isolated 4 g of product. So percentage yield would be (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100. 

First, I need to find the theoretical yield. Let's do the stoichiometry. The reaction is:

Benzoic acid (C7H6O2) + ethanol (C2H5OH) → ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2) + water.

The molar masses:

Benzoic acid: C7H6O2. Let's calculate that. Carbon is 12.01, hydrogen 1.008, oxygen 16.00. So:

7*12.01 = 84.07

6*1.008 = 6.048

2*16.00 = 32.00

Total: 84.07 + 6.048 + 32 = 122.118 g/mol

Ethyl benzoate: C9H10O2. 

9*12.01 = 108.09

10*1.008 = 10.08

2*16.00 = 32.00

Total: 108.09 + 10.08 +32 = 150.17 g/mol

So, the molar ratio is 1:1 between benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate. 

The starting amount of benzoic acid is 10 grams. So moles of benzoic acid = 10 g / 122.118 g/mol ≈ let me compute that.

10 divided by 122.118 is approximately 0.0819 moles. 

The theoretical yield of ethyl benzoate would be same moles, so 0.0819 mol * molar mass of ethyl benzoate (150.17 g/mol) = 0.0819 * 150.17 ≈ let's see. 

0.08 * 150 is 12, so 0.0819 is a bit more. Let me calculate precisely:

0.0819 * 150 = 12.285

0.0819 * 0.17 = approx 0.014. So total approx 12.285 + 0.014 ≈ 12.3 g. 

Alternatively, benzoic acid reacting with ethanol under acid catalysis. That's an esterification reaction. The product would be ethyl benzoate, right? So the starting materials are benzoic acid and ethanol, but ethanol is a solvent here, so maybe they didn't mention it in the spots. The reaction is between benzoic acid and ethanol. So the product is ethyl benzoate. 

In TLC, each compound that has a different Rf value will show a distinct spot. So if the reaction mixture contains both the starting material (benzoic acid) and the product (ethyl benzoate), those would be two different spots. The solvent might not show a spot because it's the eluent, so the solvent front is just the line where the solvent reached, but the actual components that stay on the plate are the benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate. 

Thus, under UV light, there should be two spots. That makes sense. Maybe the solvent isn't leaving a spot, so A is two. 

Hmm for part B, the percentage yield being 77.77%. Let's see. The students started with 10 g of benzoic acid. The product is ethyl benzoate. They isolated 4 g of product. So percentage yield would be (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100.

2*16.00 = 32.00

Total: 84.07 + 6.048 + 32 = 122.118 g/mol

Ethyl benzoate: C9H10O2. 

9*12.01 = 108.09

10*1.008 = 10.08

2*16.00 = 32.00

Total: 108.09 + 10.08 +32 = 150.17 g/mol

So, the molar ratio is 1:1 between benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate. 

The starting amount of benzoic acid is 10 grams. So moles of benzoic acid = 10 g / 122.118 g/mol ≈ let me compute that.

10 divided by 122.118 is approximately 0.0819 moles. 

The theoretical yield of ethyl benzoate would be same moles, so 0.0819 mol * molar mass of ethyl benzoate (150.17 g/mol) = 0.0819 * 150.17 ≈ let's see. 

0.08 * 150 is 12, so 0.0819 is a bit more. Let me calculate precisely:

0.0819 * 150 = 12.285

Yes for part B, the percentage yield being 77.77%. Let's see. The students started with 10 g of benzoic acid. The product is ethyl benzoate. They isolated 4 g of product. So percentage yield would be (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100.

So, the molar ratio is 1:1 between benzoic acid and ethyl benzoate.
