[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about the Bloch vector components of matrix Z and why the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. Let's start by recalling what a Bloch vector is. 

The Bloch vector is a way to represent a qubit's state or a 2x2 density matrix in terms of three real components, usually denoted as (x, y, z), which correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. The general form of a qubit state can be written as ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2, where I is the identity matrix. So, given a density matrix, we can extract the Bloch vector components by calculating the trace of the matrix multiplied by each Pauli matrix. 

The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. So, for a given density matrix M, the components of the Bloch vector are:
x = Tr(M σ_x)
y = Tr(M σ_y)
z = Tr(M σ_z)

Therefore, we need to calculate these traces for matrix Z and see if all of them are non-zero. 

First, let me write down matrix Z as given: Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). So, in standard matrix notation, that's:

Z = [ [2/3, 1/4],
       [1/4, 1/3] ]

Now let's compute each component one by one. 

Starting with the z-component, which is the trace of Z multiplied by σ_z. Wait, actually, the formula is just the trace of M times σ_z? Let me confirm: the expectation value <σ_z> is Tr(ρ σ_z). Since Z is the density matrix here, so z-component is Tr(Z σ_z). Similarly for x and y.

Let me calculate z first because σ_z is diagonal, so the multiplication might be straightforward.

Calculating z-component (Tr(Z σ_z)):

First, let's compute Z * σ_z. 

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so multiplying Z with σ_z:

Z σ_z = [ [ (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0), (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) ],
           [ (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0), (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) ] ]

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication is row by column. Let me correct that. 

To compute Z multiplied by σ_z:

First row of Z times first column of σ_z:

(2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

First row of Z times second column of σ_z:

(2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4

Second row of Z times first column of σ_z:

(1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

Second row of Z times second column of σ_z:

(1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3

So Z σ_z is:

[ [ 2/3, -1/4 ],
  [ 1/4, -1/3 ] ]

Then, the trace of this matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements: 2/3 + (-1/3) = (2/3 - 1/3) = 1/3. 

Wait, but hold on, actually, when calculating the trace for the z-component, maybe I should instead compute Tr(Z σ_z). Alternatively, since trace is linear and cyclic, Tr(Z σ_z) is equal to Tr(σ_z Z). However, since σ_z is diagonal, multiplying σ_z with Z would just scale the rows, but the trace would be the sum of the diagonal elements of Z multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements of σ_z. 

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to compute Tr(Z σ_z):

The trace is the sum over the diagonal elements of Z multiplied by σ_z's diagonal elements. Since σ_z has 1 and -1 on the diagonal, so:

Tr(Z σ_z) = (2/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) = (2/3 - 1/3) = 1/3. 

Ah, that's a quicker way. Because trace of a product of diagonal matrices is the sum of the products of their diagonal elements. But actually, Z and σ_z are both 2x2, so if we compute Tr(Z σ_z), it's the same as the sum over i,j of Z_ij * (σ_z)_ji. Wait, actually, the trace is the sum over i of (Z σ_z)_ii. 

Alternatively, maybe I overcomplicated it. The trace of Z σ_z is equal to the trace of σ_z Z because trace is invariant under cyclic permutations. Since σ_z is diagonal, multiplying Z by σ_z on the right would multiply each column of Z by the corresponding diagonal element of σ_z. But since trace is the sum of diagonal elements, maybe the calculation is as follows:

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the standard formula for the expectation value. Since σ_z is diagonal, the expectation value <σ_z> = Tr(Z σ_z) would be Z_11*(1) + Z_22*(-1). Wait, actually, σ_z is diagonal with entries 1 and -1, so Tr(Z σ_z) = Z_{11}*1 + Z_{22}*(-1). Let me verify this:

Yes, because when you multiply Z and σ_z, the diagonal entries of the product will be Z_{11}*1 + Z_{12}*0 (for first entry) and Z_{21}*0 + Z_{22}*(-1). So the trace is Z_{11} + (-Z_{22}). 

Therefore, for matrix Z:

Z_{11} is 2/3, Z_{22} is 1/3, so Tr(Z σ_z) = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3. So that's the z-component. So z = 1/3, which is non-zero. 

Now moving on to the x-component, which is Tr(Z σ_x). Let's compute that. 

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so let's compute Z σ_x:

Z*σ_x = [ [ (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1), (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) ],
           [ (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(1), (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) ] ]

Wait, again, matrix multiplication step by step:

First row of Z times first column of σ_x: (2/3)*0 + (1/4)*1 = 1/4

First row of Z times second column of σ_x: (2/3)*1 + (1/4)*0 = 2/3

Second row of Z times first column of σ_x: (1/4)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3

Second row of Z times second column of σ_x: (1/4)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 1/4

So Z σ_x is:

[ [1/4, 2/3],
  [1/3, 1/4] ]

The trace of this matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to compute Tr(Z σ_x). Since trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, so Tr(Z σ_x) = Tr(σ_x Z). Since σ_x is symmetric (σ_x = σ_x^T), maybe the calculation is easier. Let me try that way:

Compute σ_x Z:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying with Z:

First row of σ_x times first column of Z: 0*(2/3) + 1*(1/4) = 1/4

First row of σ_x times second column of Z: 0*(1/4) + 1*(1/3) = 1/3

Second row of σ_x times first column of Z: 1*(2/3) + 0*(1/4) = 2/3

Second row of σ_x times second column of Z: 1*(1/4) + 0*(1/3) = 1/4

Therefore, σ_x Z is:

[ [1/4, 1/3],
  [2/3, 1/4] ]

Trace is 1/4 +1/4 = 1/2. Same result. So the x-component is 1/2, which is non-zero. 

Now, moving on to the y-component, which is Tr(Z σ_y). 

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute Z σ_y and then take the trace. 

First, compute Z multiplied by σ_y:

Z σ_y = [ [ (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i), (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) ],
           [ (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i), (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) ] ]

Wait, let me do it step by step.

First row of Z times first column of σ_y:

(2/3)*0 + (1/4)*(i) = (i)/4

First row of Z times second column of σ_y:

(2/3)*(-i) + (1/4)*0 = - (2i)/3

Second row of Z times first column of σ_y:

(1/4)*0 + (1/3)*(i) = i/3

Second row of Z times second column of σ_y:

(1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0 = -i/4

So Z σ_y is:

[ [i/4, -2i/3],
  [i/3, -i/4] ]

The trace here is the sum of the diagonal elements: (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, hold on, let me recheck the second entry of the second row. 

Wait, the second row, second column entry: (1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0, right? So yes, that's -i/4. 

So the diagonal entries are i/4 and -i/4. Adding those gives: i/4 - i/4 = 0. Hmm, so the trace is zero? But that would suggest the y-component is zero. But the question states that every component is non-zero, so that contradicts that?

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using another approach. Alternatively, compute Tr(Z σ_y). Since trace is linear, and since σ_y is anti-symmetric (σ_y^† = -σ_y), but perhaps there is a better way. 

Alternatively, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the signs. Let me recalculate Z σ_y:

First row:

First element: [2/3, 1/4] multiplied by first column of σ_y which is [0; i]. So (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4. Correct.

Second element: first row of Z times second column of σ_y which is [-i; 0]. So (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = -2i/3. Correct.

Second row:

First element: second row of Z [1/4, 1/3] times first column [0; i] gives (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3. Correct.

Second element: second row of Z times second column of σ_y [-i; 0]. So (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4. Correct.

Therefore, the diagonal elements are indeed i/4 and -i/4, so trace is 0. Wait, but that's problematic because the question says every component is non-zero. Hmm, so maybe I made an error?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute Tr(Z σ_y), but the trace of a complex matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries, so even if they are complex, their sum could be real or complex? Wait, no, the trace can be complex, but the components of the Bloch vector should be real numbers. Because the expectation values of Hermitian operators (Pauli matrices are Hermitian) must be real. 

Wait a second! σ_y is Hermitian, so Tr(Z σ_y) must be the expectation value of σ_y, which should be a real number. However, in my calculation, the trace came out as zero, which is real, but is that correct? Let me check again. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Tr(Z σ_y). Let me use another method. Let me note that for any matrix M, Tr(M σ_y) can be expressed as the sum over the off-diagonal elements. Let's see:

Alternatively, note that:

Tr(Z σ_y) = sum_{i,j} Z_{i,j} (σ_y)_{j,i}

Because when you multiply Z and σ_y, the diagonal entries are sum_j Z_{i,j} (σ_y)_{j,i}, so the trace is sum_i Z_{i,i} (σ_y)_{i,i} + sum_{i≠j} Z_{i,j} (σ_y)_{j,i} but since σ_y's diagonal entries are zero except for (σ_y)_{1,2} and (σ_y)_{2,1}? Wait, no, σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so (σ_y)_{1,1}=0, (σ_y)_{1,2}=-i, (σ_y)_{2,1}=i, (σ_y)_{2,2}=0. 

Therefore, the trace is sum_{i,j} Z_{i,j} (σ_y)_{j,i}

So that would be:

Z_{1,1}*(σ_y)_{1,1} + Z_{1,2}*(σ_y)_{2,1} + Z_{2,1}*(σ_y)_{1,2} + Z_{2,2}*(σ_y)_{2,2}

Plugging in:

Z_{1,1}*(0) + Z_{1,2}*(i) + Z_{2,1}*(-i) + Z_{2,2}*(0)

Because (σ_y)_{2,1} is i (since σ_y has i in the (2,1) position) and (σ_y)_{1,2} is -i. 

Therefore, Tr(Z σ_y) = Z_{12}*i + Z_{21}*(-i)

Given that matrix Z has entries Z_{12}=1/4 and Z_{21}=1/4 (since it's [2/3, 1/4;1/4,1/3]), so substituting:

Tr(Z σ_y) = (1/4)*i + (1/4)*(-i) = (i/4 - i/4) = 0. 

So that's correct. So the y-component is zero. Wait, that contradicts the question's answer that every component is non-zero. So either I made a mistake, or maybe I misread the matrix?

Wait, let me check the given matrix Z again. The user wrote:

"Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)"

So, the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. So that is correct. So according to this, the y-component is zero. But the question says the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition of the Bloch vector components. Maybe the formula is different? Let me confirm. 

The standard Bloch vector is defined as (Tr(ρ σ_x), Tr(ρ σ_y), Tr(ρ σ_z)). However, sometimes people might define it differently, but usually, it's that. Alternatively, maybe there's a factor of 2? Let me recall:

Yes, the standard expression is ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Therefore, solving for the Bloch vector components gives x = 2 Tr(ρ σ_x), etc. Wait, that's crucial! 

Oh no, I think I forgot the factor of 2 here. Because in the expression:

ρ = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2,

Therefore, multiplying both sides by 2:

2ρ = I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z,

Then, taking the trace of both sides with σ_x:

Tr(2ρ σ_x) = Tr(σ_x) + v_x Tr(σ_x²) + v_y Tr(σ_y σ_x) + v_z Tr(σ_z σ_x)

But since trace of σ_x is zero, and σ_x squared is identity, so Tr(σ_x²) = Tr(I) = 2. The cross terms like Tr(σ_y σ_x) are zero because Pauli matrices are trace-orthogonal. Therefore,

Tr(2ρ σ_x) = v_x * 2,

Therefore, v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x). Wait, so actually, the components of the Bloch vector are exactly Tr(ρ σ_i) for each Pauli matrix. Therefore, my previous calculation is correct. So if Tr(Z σ_y) is zero, then the y-component is zero, meaning that the answer is not correct? But the question states that the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. 

Hmm, so this is a problem. Either I made a mistake in calculations, or maybe I misread the matrix? Let me check again.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement again. The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

The semicolon separates the rows, so Z's first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. That's correct. So according to this, the y-component is zero. But the question says that the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the trace?

Wait, another thought: Is the matrix Z Hermitian? Because if it's a density matrix, it should be Hermitian. Let's check.

Density matrices must be Hermitian, so their off-diagonal elements must be complex conjugates. Let's see: For Z:

First off-diagonal elements: (1,2) entry is 1/4, and (2,1) entry is also 1/4. Since 1/4 is real, their complex conjugates are equal, so that's okay. The diagonal entries are 2/3 and 1/3 which are real. So yes, Z is Hermitian. So that's fine.

Wait, but when calculating the y-component, which involves the imaginary unit, but the trace came out as zero? Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different convention for the Bloch vector. For example, sometimes the Pauli matrices are scaled differently. Wait, let me recall the standard definition again.

The standard Bloch vector is given by:

ρ = (I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) / 2,

where \vec{r} = (x, y, z). Therefore, to get the components:

x = Tr(ρ σ_x )

y = Tr(ρ σ_y )

z = Tr(ρ σ_z )

Therefore, components can be real or complex? But no, because Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so the trace of a Hermitian matrix times a Hermitian matrix (since ρ is Hermitian as a density matrix) must be real. 

Therefore, the traces must be real. However, when calculating Tr(Z σ_y), we had an imaginary result? Wait, no, in my calculation above, it turned out to be zero. Let me check again.

Wait, in the calculation using the second method, I had:

Tr(Z σ_y) = Z_{12}*i + Z_{21}*(-i)

But since Z is Hermitian, Z_{21} is the conjugate of Z_{12}. Here, Z_{12}=1/4 is real, so Z_{21}=1/4. Therefore,

Tr(Z σ_y) = (1/4)i + (1/4)(-i) = 0. 

Therefore, the y-component is indeed zero. So according to this, the y-component is zero, which would contradict the answer given. But the user says the correct answer is "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So either there is a mistake in the problem, or I made an error?

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a different source where the Bloch vector is defined differently, perhaps using different conventions for the Pauli matrices? Let me check the Pauli matrices again.

Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Yes, that's standard. So perhaps I messed up the calculation for the y-component?

Alternatively, let me compute Tr(Z σ_y) using another approach. Since trace is sum over diagonal elements of the product. Let me compute Z σ_y:

As before, Z σ_y is:

[ [i/4, -2i/3],
  [i/3, -i/4] ]

The trace is (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So that's correct. Therefore, the y-component is zero. 

Hmm. Therefore, according to my calculations, matrix Z has a zero y-component. But the question states the correct answer is every component is non-zero. 

Wait, perhaps there is a typo in the matrix? Let me check other matrices given, maybe there was a mix-up. Let me check matrix Y:

Y is given as (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). So that matrix would have off-diagonal elements i/3 and -i/3, so for Y's y-component, it would be non-zero?

Indeed, for matrix Y, the Tr(Y σ_y) would be Y_{12}*i + Y_{21}*(-i) = (i/3)*i + (-i/3)*(-i) = (i^2)/3 + (i^2)/3 = (-1)/3 + (-1)/3 = -2/3, so that's non-zero. So Y's y-component is non-zero, but maybe the question is referring to Z?

Wait, the question says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So according to my calculation, that's not true. Maybe I made an error in calculation?

Wait, let me recheck the trace again step by step. 

Given Z:

Z = [ [2/3, 1/4],
       [1/4, 1/3] ]

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Compute the product Z * σ_y:

First row first column: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4

First row second column: (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = -2i/3

Second row first column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3

Second row second column: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4

So the product Z σ_y is correct. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, which are i/4 and -i/4. Adding them gives zero. 

Alternatively, is there a different interpretation of the matrices given? Maybe the user wrote the matrices in a different order? For instance, maybe they are written as row vectors separated by semicolons, but perhaps the first entry is the (1,2) entry? Wait, no. The user says "the format of the above matrices is such that the semicolon separates the rows", so the first row is (1/2, i/4) for W, then second row (-i/4, 1/2). So that is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the components of the Bloch vector in a different basis? Or maybe the question is referring to something else?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the x-component. Let me check again. 

For the x-component, which was Tr(Z σ_x). We had:

Z σ_x is:

[ [1/4, 2/3],
  [1/3, 1/4] ]

Trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Correct. 

The z-component was 1/3. 

So x=1/2, y=0, z=1/3. Therefore, y-component is zero, so the statement "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero" is false. Therefore, why is this the correct answer? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mistyped and refers to another matrix. Let me check the other matrices quickly. 

Take matrix X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Let's compute its Bloch components quickly. 

First, x-component Tr(X σ_x). 

X σ_x:

First row: (1/3*0 +1*1, 1/3*1 +1*0) = (1, 1/3)

Second row: (1*0 + 2/3*1, 1*1 + 2/3*0) = (2/3, 1)

So trace is 1 +1 = 2? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, actually:

Wait, perhaps better to calculate Tr(X σ_x). Since σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:

Tr(X σ_x) = X_{11}(0) + X_{12}(1) + X_{21}(1) + X_{22}(0). Wait no, trace is the sum over i of (X σ_x)_{ii}

Alternatively, using the same method as before:

Tr(X σ_x) = X_{11}*0 + X_{12}*1 + X_{21}*1 + X_{22}*0 = (1)*(1) + (1)*(1) = 2. Wait, but that can't be, because the trace of X must have components scaled properly. 

Wait, actually, let me compute it correctly. 

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying X and σ_x:

X σ_x = [ (1/3*0 + 1*1), (1/3*1 + 1*0) ] first row,

second row: [ (1*0 + 2/3*1), (1*1 + 2/3*0) ]

Therefore,

First row entries: 1, 1/3,

Second row entries: 2/3, 1,

Thus, the trace is first diagonal element 1 and second 1, so total trace is 2. But then x-component would be 2, but since the density matrix must have trace 1, the Bloch vector components can't exceed 1 in magnitude? Wait, but the components can be up to 1 or more? Wait, let me recall the maximum value for a component.

The Bloch vector components are given by Tr(ρ σ_i), and since σ_i is Hermitian with eigenvalues ±1, the expectation value must lie between -1 and 1. So components must be in [-1, 1]. 

Therefore, if Tr(X σ_x)=2, that is impossible because the maximum value for Tr(ρ σ_x) is 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here. 

Wait, let me compute X's trace. X is (1/3,1;1,2/3). The trace of X is 1/3 + 2/3 =1, so it's a density matrix. 

Wait, to compute Tr(X σ_x):

Using the other method, where Tr(X σ_x) = X_{12} + X_{21} Because in the formula:

Tr(X σ_x) = sum_{i,j,k} X_{i,k} (σ_x)_{k,j} delta_{i,j} ?

Alternatively, better to use the formula:

Tr(X σ_x) = sum_{i,j} X_{i,j} (σ_x)_{j,i}

σ_x's entries: (σ_x)_{1,1}=0, (σ_x)_{1,2}=1, (σ_x)_{2,1}=1, (σ_x)_{2,2}=0.

Thus,

Tr(X σ_x) = X_{1,1}*0 + X_{1,2}*1 + X_{2,1}*1 + X_{2,2}*0 = X_{12} + X_{21} = 1 +1 =2. But that's violating the expectation value being between -1 and 1. 

Clearly, something is wrong here. Wait, actually, σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so the expectation value must satisfy |Tr(ρ σ_x)| ≤1. 

Wait, but that can't be. Wait, the problem arises because the user might have written the matrix in a different form. Wait, hold on. Matrix X is given as (1/3,1;1,2/3). So the entries are:

X = [ [1/3, 1], 

       [1, 2/3] ]

The trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1, so it's a density matrix. But when I compute Tr(X σ_x), I get 2? That's impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, perhaps the trace formula is different. Let me compute the trace of X*σ_x directly:

X*σ_x = 

First element (1,1): (1/3)*0 + 1*1 =1,

(1,2): (1/3)*1 + 1*0 =1/3,

(2,1): 1*0 + (2/3)*1 = 2/3,

(2,2):1*1 + (2/3)*0 =1,

Thus, the matrix is:

[1, 1/3,

2/3, 1]

Trace is 1 +1 =2, which is impossible.

Ah! Wait, so this suggests that matrix X is not a valid density matrix? But its trace is 1. However, the trace of X σ_x can be greater than 1? But the expectation value can't. 

Wait, the expectation value must satisfy |Tr(ρ σ_x)| ≤1. Let me see:

The expectation value of σ_x is Tr(ρ σ_x). Since σ_x is Hermitian with eigenvalues ±1, then the expectation value is a weighted average of its eigenvalues. Hence, it must lie between -1 and 1. Therefore, if Tr(X σ_x)=2, that is impossible, so this suggests that matrix X is not a valid density matrix. But its trace is 1. 

Therefore, maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me recalculate:

Wait, perhaps I forgot to divide by 2? Wait no. Wait, σ_x is a Pauli matrix with trace 0, but the trace of X σ_x is 2, so maybe I did the multiplication wrong. 

Wait, let me do the multiplication again:

Compute X multiplied by σ_x:

X is:

Row 1: 1/3, 1

Row 2: 1, 2/3

σ_x is:

Column 1: 0,1

Column 2:1,0

First row of X times first column of σ_x: (1/3)*0 +1*1 =1,

First row of X times second column of σ_x: (1/3)*1 +1*0 =1/3,

Second row of X times first column of σ_x:1*0 + (2/3)*1 =2/3,

Second row of X times second column of σ_x:1*1 + (2/3)*0 =1,

So the resulting matrix is correct. Therefore, Trace is 1+1=2. 

But that's impossible. So matrix X is not a valid density matrix? 

Wait, but the trace of X is 1. Let me check if it's positive semi-definite. 

To be a density matrix, it must also be positive semi-definite with eigenvalues non-negative and trace 1. 

Compute the eigenvalues of X. The matrix is:

[1/3, 1;

1, 2/3]

The trace is 1, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 -1 = -7/9. Negative determinant implies that there are eigenvalues with opposite signs. Since trace is 1, the eigenvalues are (1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9))/2. Wait, sqrt(1 + 28/9)=sqrt(37/9)=sqrt(37)/3≈6.08/3≈2.02, so eigenvalues would be (1 +2.02)/2≈1.51 and (1-2.02)/2≈-0.51. Negative eigenvalue implies it's not positive semi-definite. So the matrix X is not a valid density matrix. Therefore, it's a mistake in the problem? 

Hmm, that's very confusing. Similarly, the matrix Z has off-diagonal entries of 1/4, which are real. So let me check if Z is a valid density matrix. 

Trace of Z is 2/3 +1/3 =1. The determinant is (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)^2 = 2/9 - 1/16 ≈0.222 -0.0625=0.1595. Positive determinant. So eigenvalues are (trace ± sqrt(trace² -4 det))/2.

Trace=1, trace squared=1, so sqrt(1 -4*(2/9 -1/16)). Wait, determinant is (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)^2 = (2/9) - (1/16) = (32/144 -9/144)=23/144≈0.1597.

Thus eigenvalues:

[1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(23/144))]/2

Compute discriminant:

1 - (92/144)= (144-92)/144=52/144=13/36≈0.3611. sqrt(13/36)=sqrt(13)/6≈1.199/6≈0.199. 

Thus eigenvalues ≈ (1 ±0.199)/2.

Thus, (1.199)/2≈0.5995 and (0.801)/2≈0.4005. So both positive. Hence, Z is a valid density matrix. 

Therefore, returning to Z's Bloch vector, according to my calculations, it has components (1/2, 0, 1/3). So the y-component is zero. 

Therefore, unless I made a mistake in the problem statement interpretation, the correct answer should not be that every component is non-zero. However, the question says that the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to matrix Y instead of Z? Let me check matrix Y. 

Matrix Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/
[overthinking]
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is about determining why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of matrix Z is nonzero. The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z. I need to figure out which matrix has all components of its Bloch vector non-zero. Let me recall what a Bloch vector is.

The Bloch vector is a representation of a qubit's state in terms of the Pauli matrices. Any single-qubit density matrix can be written in the form:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are the Pauli matrices, and r = (r_x, r_y, r_z) is the Bloch vector with components between -1 and 1. So, the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the decomposition give the components of the Bloch vector.

Therefore, to find the Bloch vector components, I need to express each given matrix as a combination of the identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices, then read off the coefficients.

First, let me recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [0 1; 1 0]

σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

σ_z = [1 0; 0 -1]

The identity matrix I is [1 0; 0 1].

So, for any matrix M, we can write M = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. But since density matrices trace is 1, that's consistent here because Tr(I) = 2, so (I + ...)/2 will have trace 1.

Wait, actually, let me check the trace. If we write ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then the trace of ρ is (Tr(I) + r_x Tr(σ_x) + r_y Tr(σ_y) + r_z Tr(σ_z))/2. But the traces of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all zero. So Tr(ρ) = (2 + 0 + 0 + 0)/2 = 1, which is correct.

So the decomposition works. To find the Bloch vector components r_x, r_y, r_z for a given matrix, I need to compute the coefficients when expressing the matrix as a linear combination of the identity and the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, since the Pauli matrices form a basis, we can compute the coefficients via the inner product.

Alternatively, perhaps more straightforward, since the given matrices are 2x2, we can do this by equating terms.

Let me start with matrix Z:

Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Wait, let me parse the notation again. The user said "the format is such that the semicolon separates the rows". So for Z:

First row is 2/3 and 1/4

Second row is 1/4 and 1/3

Wait, but matrices should have trace 1 since they are density matrices? Let me check the trace of Z first. The trace is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, so that's okay.

Now, let me write out the decomposition. Let me denote the components:

Let Z = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. We need to solve for r_x, r_y, r_z.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that the Bloch vector components can be calculated using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically,

r_x = Tr(σ_x Z),

r_y = Tr(σ_y Z),

r_z = Tr(σ_z Z).

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula.

Actually, since ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting I gives 2ρ - I = r·σ, so taking the trace with each Pauli matrix,

Tr(σ_x (2ρ - I)) = Tr(σ_x r·σ).

But since Tr(σ_x σ_y) = 0 for x≠y, and Tr(σ_x^2) = 2.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way. Let me recall that for a matrix M = (m_{11}, m_{12}; m_{21}, m_{22}) written in terms of Pauli matrices:

M = ( (m_{11} + m_{22})/2 ) I + ( (m_{12} + m_{21})/2 ) σ_x + ( (m_{21} - m_{12})/(2i) ) σ_y + ( (m_{11} - m_{22})/2 ) σ_z.

Let me verify this formula. Let me compute each component.

The identity matrix contributes (I_{11} + I_{22}) /2 = (1 +1)/2 = 1, but scaled by the coefficient. Wait, perhaps better to express M in terms of the basis {I, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z}.

Let me write M as a combination:

M = a I + b σ_x + c σ_y + d σ_z.

Then,

The (1,1) entry of M is a*1 + b*0 + c*0 + d*1 = a + d.

The (1,2) entry is a*0 + b*1 + c*(-i) + d*0 = b - i c.

Similarly, the (2,1) entry is b + i c (since σ_x has 1 in the (2,1) entry, and σ_y has i there).

The (2,2) entry is a + (-d).

So, writing equations:

From M_{11} = a + d,

M_{22} = a - d,

so adding them: M_{11} + M_{22} = 2a => a = (M_{11} + M_{22}) / 2,

subtracting them: M_{11} - M_{22} = 2d => d = (M_{11} - M_{22}) / 2.

Similarly, the off-diagonal terms:

M_{12} = b - i c,

M_{21} = b + i c,

Therefore, adding M_{12} + M_{21} = 2b => b = (M_{12} + M_{21}) / 2,

and subtracting (M_{21} - M_{12}) = 2i c => c = (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i).

Therefore, the coefficients are:

a = (M_{11} + M_{22}) / 2,

b = (M_{12} + M_{21}) / 2,

c = (M_{21} - M_{12}) / (2i),

d = (M_{11} - M_{22}) / 2.

Therefore, the Bloch vector components are (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (b, c, d).

Wait, let me confirm:

Wait, the general formula for the Bloch vector is:

r_x = Tr(σ_x M),

r_y = Tr(σ_y M),

r_z = Tr(σ_z M),

but let me see if that matches.

Alternatively, according to the decomposition above, since M = a I + b σ_x + c σ_y + d σ_z,

then the coefficients b corresponds to σ_x, which is r_x,

c corresponds to σ_y, which is r_y,

d corresponds to σ_z, which is r_z,

so yes, so r_x = b,

r_y = c,

r_z = d.

So, using the formulas above,

r_x = (M_{12} + M_{21}) / 2,

r_y = (M_{21} - M_{12}) / (2i),

r_z = (M_{11} - M_{22}) / 2.

Alright, so with that in mind, let me compute the components for matrix Z.

Matrix Z is:

First row: 2/3, 1/4

Second row: 1/4, 1/3

Therefore, entries:

M11 = 2/3,

M12 = 1/4,

M21 = 1/4,

M22 = 1/3.

First, compute r_z = (M11 - M22)/2 = (2/3 - 1/3)/2 = (1/3)/2 = 1/6. So that's non-zero.

Next, r_x = (M12 + M21)/2 = (1/4 + 1/4)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4. So that's non-zero.

r_y = (M21 - M12)/(2i) = (1/4 - 1/4)/(2i) = 0/(2i) = 0. Wait, that's zero? Hmm, so r_y is zero?

Wait, hold on, let me check again:

Wait M21 is 1/4 and M12 is 1/4, so M21 - M12 = 0. Therefore, r_y is zero. That would mean the y-component is zero, so that contradicts the answer that every component is non-zero. But the answer given is "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So perhaps I made a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for r_y. Let me recheck the formula.

From above, r_y = (M21 - M12)/(2i). But let's see:

Looking back at the decomposition, the coefficient c (which is r_y) is (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i). Since σ_y has the (2,1) entry as i, so when we compute the (2,1) entry of the combination, it's b*1 (from σ_x) + c*i (from σ_y), so that's why:

M_{21} = b + i c,

Similarly, M_{12} = b - i c.

Hence, subtracting: M_{21} - M_{12} = 2i c => c = (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i).

Yes, so that formula is correct.

Therefore, in the case of Z, since M_{21} and M_{12} are both 1/4, their difference is zero, so r_y is zero. Therefore, the y-component is zero, which would mean that not all components of Z's Bloch vector are non-zero, which contradicts the given correct answer. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe I parsed the matrix incorrectly. Let me check again the matrix Z: the user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem? Let me confirm again.

The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So the first row is 2/3 and 1/4, second row is 1/4 and 1/3. So M12 and M21 are both 1/4. So indeed, difference is zero. Therefore, r_y is zero. Then the answer would be wrong?

But the question says the correct answer is that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I need to consider the off-diagonal terms as complex numbers. Wait, are the entries of Z complex? The problem statement lists them as:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). Since there are no i's mentioned here, so those are real numbers. Therefore, the off-diagonal entries are real, so M_{12} = M_{21}^*, but if they are real, then M_{21}=M_{12}, so their difference is zero, hence r_y is zero. Therefore, in that case, the y-component is zero, so the answer given that every component is non-zero is incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem's matrix entries. Let me check the other matrices to see if maybe I need to consider another matrix?

Wait, the question says: "Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?"

Wait, perhaps I misread the matrices. Let me check again:

The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Yes, according to this, Z has real entries except for W and Y which have imaginary off-diagonals. So let's recheck the components for Z again:

Trace of Z is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, so that's okay.

r_z: (2/3 - 1/3)/2 = (1/3)/2 = 1/6 ≠0

r_x: (1/4 +1/4)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4 ≠0

r_y: (1/4 - 1/4)/(2i)=0/(2i)=0. So indeed zero. Hmm.

So if that's the case, then the answer should not be Z. Maybe there's a mistake in the question?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for r_y. Let me rederive it again. Let's do it step by step.

Suppose we have a matrix:

M = aI + bσ_x + cσ_y + dσ_z.

Compute the entries:

The (1,1) entry of σ_x is 0, σ_y is 0, σ_z is 1. So:

M_{11} = a*1 + b*0 + c*0 + d*1 = a + d.

Similarly, (2,2) entry of σ_z is -1, so M_{22} = a*1 + b*0 + c*0 + d*(-1) = a - d.

The (1,2) entry of σ_x is 1, σ_y is -i, σ_z is 0. So:

M_{12} = a*0 + b*1 + c*(-i) + d*0 = b - i c.

Similarly, (2,1) entry of σ_x is 1, σ_y is i, so:

M_{21} = a*0 + b*1 + c*(i) + d*0 = b + i c.

Therefore, writing equations:

M_{12} = b - i c,

M_{21} = b + i c.

Therefore, adding them:

M_{12} + M_{21} = 2b => b = (M_{12} + M_{21}) / 2,

subtracting:

M_{21} - M_{12} = 2i c => c = (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i),

So that's correct.

Therefore, for matrix Z, since M_{12} = M_{21} = 1/4, their difference is 0, so c = 0, hence r_y =0.

Therefore, the Bloch vector of Z has components (r_x, 0, r_z). So two components are non-zero, but the y-component is zero. Therefore, the statement "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero" is false. Hmm, so maybe I need to check the other matrices?

Wait, the question says "choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?" So perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's matrix entries? Let me check the other matrices to see if maybe one of them has all components non-zero.

Let's check matrix W:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

So entries:

M11 = 1/2, M12 = i/4,

M21 = -i/4, M22 = 1/2.

Compute r_z = (M11 - M22)/2 = (1/2 -1/2)/2 = 0,

r_x = (M12 + M21)/2 = (i/4 + (-i)/4)/2 = 0,

r_y = (M21 - M12)/(2i) = (-i/4 -i/4)/(2i) = (-i/2)/(2i) = (-1/2)/2 = -1/4.

Therefore, Bloch vector (0, -1/4, 0). So only y-component is non-zero.

Therefore, W is the Y matrix? Probably, but not relevant here.

Next, matrix X:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

So entries:

M11 = 1/3, M12 =1,

M21 =1, M22=2/3.

r_z = (1/3 - 2/3)/2 = (-1/3)/2 = -1/6,

r_x = (1 +1)/2 = 1,

r_y = (1 -1)/(2i)=0/(2i)=0,

So components (1, 0, -1/6). So y-component is zero again. So only x and z components non-zero.

Now matrix Y:

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Entries:

M11 = 1/2, M12 = i/3,

M21 = -i/3, M22 = 1/2.

r_z = (1/2 -1/2)/2 = 0,

r_x = (i/3 + (-i)/3)/2 = 0,

r_y = ( -i/3 - i/3 )/(2i) = ( -2i/3 ) / (2i) ) = (-2i/3)/(2i) = (-1)/3,

So components (0, -1/3, 0). So only the y-component is non-zero. So similar to W but scaled.

Therefore, among all the matrices given:

- W has only r_y non-zero,

- X has r_x and r_z,

- Y has r_y,

- Z has r_x and r_z.

Therefore, none of the matrices have all three components non-zero. Wait, but the problem states that the correct answer is Z with all components non-zero. But according to my calculations, Z's y-component is zero. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, hold on, perhaps the problem is that when calculating r_y, I should have considered the imaginary parts?

Wait, in the case of matrix Z, since all entries are real, except for the diagonal ones? Wait, in matrix Z, all entries are real, so M_{12} and M_{21} are both real, so their difference is zero, so r_y is zero. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem's given matrices. Let me check again the problem's Z:

The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So that's first row [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3], which are all real numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and the off-diagonal entries were supposed to have an i? Let me see. For example, maybe in the problem statement, Z was supposed to be (2/3, i/4; -i/4, 1/3) similar to W and Y, but that's not what's written here.

Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question? The question says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?" Maybe the other options (not given here) have other answers, and the user is telling that the correct one is Z's Bloch vector components are all non-zero, but according to calculations, that's not the case. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the Bloch vector is different? Let me check another way.

Alternatively, compute Tr(σ_x Z), Tr(σ_y Z), Tr(σ_z Z). Let's try that.

For matrix Z,

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so Tr(σ_x Z) = (0)*(2/3) + (1)*(1/4) + (1)*(1/4) + (0)*(1/3) = 1/4 +1/4 = 1/2. So r_x = Tr(σ_x Z) = 1/2? Wait, but according to previous calculation, r_x was 1/4. Wait, this inconsistency is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recall that in the standard formula, the Bloch vector components are Tr(σ_i ρ), so that's correct. Wait, let me recast.

Wait, in the decomposition ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

then, Tr(σ_i ρ) = Tr(σ_i (I + r·σ)/2 ) = (Tr(σ_i ) + Tr(r_j σ_j σ_i )) /2.

But since Tr(σ_i ) = 0, and Tr(σ_j σ_i ) is 2δ_{i,j}. So,

Tr(σ_i ρ) = (r_i * 2)/2 = r_i.

Therefore, r_i = Tr(σ_i ρ).

Therefore, in this case, the components are indeed Tr(σ_x Z), Tr(σ_y Z), Tr(σ_z Z).

So let's compute them.

For Z:

Tr(σ_x Z) = (σ_x Z)_{11} + (σ_x Z)_{22}

But actually, trace is sum of diagonal entries after multiplying σ_x and Z.

Wait, alternatively, compute σ_x multiplied by Z, then take trace.

σ_x * Z = [ [0,1],[1,0] ] * [ [2/3,1/4],[1/4,1/3] ]

First element (1,1): 0*(2/3) + 1*(1/4) = 1/4

(1,2): 0*(1/4) +1*(1/3) = 1/3

(2,1):1*(2/3) +0*(1/4)=2/3,

(2,2):1*(1/4) +0*(1/3)=1/4

Therefore, σ_x Z = [ [1/4, 1/3],[2/3, 1/4] ]

Trace of this is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So Tr(σ_x Z)=1/2, which would mean r_x=1/2.

Wait, but according to the previous calculation, using the decomposition, we had r_x=(M_{12} + M_{21})/2= (1/4 +1/4)/2=1/4. Contradiction. Which is correct?

Wait, this must be because of a misunderstanding in the decomposition formula. Let me check that again.

Wait, in the decomposition M = a I + b σ_x + c σ_y + d σ_z,

then, the coefficient b is equal to (M_{12} + M_{21}) / 2,

but in the case of the trace formula, r_x = Tr(σ_x M) = b * Tr(σ_x^2) + ... ?

Wait, actually, if M = aI + bσ_x + cσ_y + dσ_z,

then Tr(σ_x M) = Tr(σ_x (aI + bσ_x + cσ_y + dσ_z )) = a Tr(σ_x I) + b Tr(σ_x^2) + c Tr(σ_x σ_y) + d Tr(σ_x σ_z).

Now, Tr(σ_x I) = Tr(I σ_x) = Tr(σ_x) =0,

Tr(σ_x^2)= Tr([1 0;0 1])=2,

Tr(σ_x σ_y)=0,

Tr(σ_x σ_z)=0,

Therefore, Tr(σ_x M)= b*2,

so r_x = Tr(σ_x M)=2b => b= r_x /2.

Wait a second, so my initial decomposition formula was incorrect?

Wait, so in the decomposition M = a I + b σ_x + c σ_y + d σ_z,

then the coefficients a, b, c, d are such that:

r_x = Tr(σ_x M) = 2b,

so b = r_x / 2,

Similarly, r_y = Tr(σ_y M) = 2c,

so c = r_y /2,

r_z = Tr(σ_z M) = 2d,

so d = r_z /2,

and a = (M_{11} + M_{22}) /2,

as before.

Therefore, there was an error in my initial decomposition approach. That's the key!

So I had confused the coefficients. The coefficients in the decomposition M = aI + bσ_x + cσ_y + dσ_z are such that the Bloch vector components are 2b, 2c, 2d. Therefore, my previous calculation for r_x, r_y, r_z using entries was missing a factor of 2.

Wait, let me redo the calculations properly.

Given that,

r_x = Tr(σ_x M) = 2b,

so b = (Tr(σ_x M))/2,

Similarly,

r_y = Tr(σ_y M) = 2c,

so c = (Tr(σ_y M))/2,

r_z = Tr(σ_z M) = 2d,

so d = (Tr(σ_z M))/2.

But the entries of M are given by the decomposition:

M_{11} = a + d,

M_{22} = a - d,

M_{12} = b - i c,

M_{21}= b + i c.

Therefore, solving:

a = (M_{11} + M_{22}) /2,

d = (M_{11} - M_{22}) /2,

b = (M_{12} + M_{21}) /2,

c = (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i),

but since r_x = 2b,

r_x = 2*( (M_{12} + M_{21}) /2 ) = M_{12} + M_{21},

r_y = 2c = 2*( (M_{21} - M_{12})/(2i) ) = (M_{21} - M_{12}) /i,

r_z = 2d = (M_{11} - M_{22}).

Wait that makes more sense.

So correcting this mistake:

The correct components are:

r_x = M_{12} + M_{21},

r_y = (M_{21} - M_{12}) /i,

r_z = M_{11} - M_{22}.

Therefore, my previous calculations were wrong because I forgot that the coefficients in the decomposition are half of what the trace gives. So important to do it correctly now.

Let me recalculate for matrix Z:

Z = [2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3]

So,

r_x = M_{12} + M_{21} = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2,

r_y = (M_{21} - M_{12}) /i = (1/4 - 1/4)/i = 0/i = 0,

r_z = M_{11} - M_{22} = (2/3 - 1/3) = 1/3.

Therefore, the components are:

r_x =1/2,

r_y=0,

r_z=1/3.

So two components non-zero, y-component zero. Still, so the answer is wrong.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in another matrix?

Wait, let's check for matrix X:

X = [1/3,1;1,2/3]

Then,

r_x =1 +1=2,

r_y=(1 -1)/i=0,

r_z= (1/3 -2/3)= -1/3,

So components (2,0,-1/3). So again y-component zero.

Matrix Y:

Y= [1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2]

r_x = (i/3 + (-i)/3 ) =0,

r_y = ( (-i/3 -i/3 ) /i ) = ( (-2i/3 ) /i )= -2/3,

r_z= (1/2 -1/2)=0,

Thus components (0, -2/3,0).

Matrix W:

W= [1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2]

r_x = (i/4 + (-i)/4 ) =0,

r_y = (-i/4 -i/4)/i = (-i/2)/i = -1/2,

r_z= (1/2 -1/2)=0,

Thus components (0, -1/2,0).

So none of the matrices except maybe... none have all components non-zero. So the problem statement's correct answer is incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation for matrix Z. Let me check again the entries.

Wait for matrix Z, the entries are real, so M_{12}=M_{21}=1/4, so r_x =1/4+1/4=1/2, r_y=0, r_z=2/3 -1/3=1/3. So indeed, y-component is zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Pauli vector coefficients before scaling? But no, the standard Bloch vector is (r_x, r_y, r_z) as I defined.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different convention? Like using a different normalization? Let me check the standard definition.

In quantum mechanics, the Bloch vector is usually defined as r = 2*(Tr(σ_i ρ)). Wait, no, actually if ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then the expectation value Tr(σ_i ρ) = r_i/2, so to get r_i = 2 Tr(σ_i ρ). So the components are twice the expectation values. So my calculation above is correct.

Alternatively, maybe in the problem statement, the matrix Z was different? Let me check again the original problem's matrices. The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, perhaps the semicolon is separating rows but maybe there is a missing comma in Z? For example, maybe Z is (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, i/3) or something similar?

If the second entry in the second row of Z is an imaginary number, then it would change things. But according to the problem's notation, the user wrote Z as (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). So unless there's a missing "i", like maybe 1/4i or something.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the matrices. Let me recheck the user's input:

Original matrices:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, perhaps in Z, the first entry is 2/3, second entry 1/4 in first row; second row first entry 1/4 and second entry 1/3. So all real entries.

Hmm. Given that, unless there is a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps the correct answer is not Z? Or perhaps the question is asking for which matrix has all components non-zero, but in that case, none of them do. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for another matrix?

Wait, let me check matrix W again.

For matrix W:

r_x = (i/4 + (-i)/4) =0,

r_y = ( (-i/4 -i/4)/i ) = (-2i/4)/i = (-1/2)/1 = -1/2,

r_z = (1/2 -1/2)=0,

So (0, -1/2, 0). So only y-component.

Matrix X:

r_x=2 (as above), r_y=0, r_z= -1/3,

so (2, 0, -1/3)

Matrix Y:

r_x=0, r_y=-2/3, r_z=0,

Matrix Z:

r_x=1/2, r_y=0, r_z=1/3.

Therefore, none of them have all components non-zero. So this is a problem. The given correct answer must be wrong, unless there is a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the coefficients of the Pauli matrices but about the Bloch sphere coordinates? Wait, the Bloch vector components are exactly the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the expression ρ=(I + r·σ)/2, which is the standard. So that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different basis? Or perhaps the user made a typo in the matrices?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for which matrix has all components except one zero? But the answer says "Every component".

Alternatively, let me check matrix X again.

Matrix X has r_x=2? Wait, r_x is Tr(σ_x X). Let me recheck that.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], X is [[1/3,1],[1,2/3]]

Trace(σ_x X) is (0)(1/3) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(2/3) = 1 +1=2. So yes, r_x=2.

r_z = M_{11} - M_{22}=1/3 -2/3= -1/3,

Thus components (2,0,-1/3). So indeed, y-component zero.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another way, like if the density matrix is not trace one?

Wait, checking the trace for matrix Z: 2/3 +1/3=1, so okay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the formula for r_y?

r_y = (M21 - M12)/i,

Wait let me recalculate for matrix Z:

M21 is 1/4, M12 is 1/4,

So (1/4 -1/4)/i =0/i=0. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, the Bloch vector is defined with a different convention where the y-component is multiplied by -1?

Wait, in some conventions, the Pauli matrices might be ordered differently or with different signs. Let me see.

The standard Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Therefore, when calculating r_y, the formula comes out as (M21 - M12)/i.

Suppose instead that the Pauli_y is [[0,i],[-i,0]], then the calculation would be different.

Wait, maybe the user used a different convention for σ_y?

Wait, let me check: different sources might define σ_y with a different sign. Let me check.

According to Wikipedia, Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Let me start by recalling what a Bloch vector is. 

The Bloch vector, right, for a qubit state represented by a density matrix, can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ are the Pauli matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). The vector r = (r_x, r_y, r_z) is the Bloch vector, and each component corresponds to the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix. So, to find the Bloch vector components for matrix Z, I need to compute the expectation values of σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z with respect to Z.

First, let me write down matrix Z again to make sure I have it right. The user gave Z as (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). So in matrix form, that would be:

Z = [ 2/3   1/4 ]
    [ 1/4  1/3 ]

Wait, hold on, the user mentioned the format is entries separated by semicolons for rows. Wait, actually let me parse the input again. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So the first row is (2/3, 1/4), second row is (1/4, 1/3). Correct.

Now, the Bloch vector components are given by the trace of the matrix multiplied by each Pauli matrix. Since the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, then the expectation value of σ_i is r_i. So, tr(Z σ_i) should give me r_i.

Alternatively, since the standard form is (I + r·σ)/2, so if we have a matrix M = (I + r·σ)/2, then r_i = 2 tr(M σ_i) - tr(σ_i). But since the trace of σ_i is zero for all Pauli matrices, then r_i = 2 tr(M σ_i).

Therefore, to compute each component, I can compute the trace of Z multiplied by each Pauli matrix and then multiply by 2.

Let me recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [0 1; 1 0]

σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

σ_z = [1 0; 0 -1]

So let me compute each trace.

Starting with σ_z:

First component, r_z = 2 tr(Z σ_z)

Compute tr(Z σ_z):

Z is:

[2/3   1/4 ]

[1/4  1/3 ]

σ_z is:

[1 0 ]

[0 -1 ]

Multiplying Z and σ_z:

Wait, actually, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of Z multiplied by σ_z? Wait no, actually, trace of product is sum over i,j of Z_ij (σ_z)_ji ?

Wait, actually, let me recall that tr(A B) is the sum over i,j of A_ij B_ji. So for the trace of Z multiplied by σ_z:

Compute Z σ_z first, then take the trace, or compute the trace of the product as sum_{i,j} Z_ij (σ_z)_ji ?

Yes, trace(Z σ_z) = sum_{i,j} Z_ij (σ_z)_ji ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the product matrix first.

Let me compute Z σ_z:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4] multiplied by first column of σ_z (which is [1; 0]) gives (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3.

First row of Z times second column of σ_z (which is [0; -1]) gives (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4.

Second row of Z: [1/4, 1/3] times first column of σ_z: (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4.

Second row times second column of σ_z: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3.

So Z σ_z is:

[2/3   -1/4 ]

[1/4   -1/3 ]

Therefore, the trace is (2/3) + (-1/3) = (2/3 - 1/3) = 1/3.

Therefore, r_z = 2 * (1/3) = 2/3. So r_z is non-zero. Okay, that's one component.

Now let's do r_x, which is 2 tr(Z σ_x).

Compute tr(Z σ_x). Let's compute Z σ_x first.

σ_x is [0 1; 1 0]. So multiplying Z with σ_x:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4] times columns of σ_x:

First column of σ_x is [0; 1]. So first element of first row in product: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1) = 1/4.

Second column of σ_x is [1; 0], so first row second element: (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3.

Second row of Z: [1/4, 1/3] times σ_x columns:

First column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(1) = 1/3.

Second column: (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4.

Therefore, Z σ_x is:

[1/4    2/3 ]

[1/3    1/4 ]

The trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Wait, hold on: trace is the sum of the diagonal entries. Wait, first entry (1,1) is 1/4, second entry (2,2) is 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So tr(Z σ_x) is 1/2. Then r_x = 2*(1/2) = 1. So r_x is 1, which is non-zero. Hmm, interesting.

Now for r_y = 2 tr(Z σ_y). Let me compute that.

σ_y is [0 -i; i 0]. So Z σ_y would be:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4] multiplied by columns of σ_y.

First column of σ_y is [0; i]. So first element:

(2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = (i)/4.

Second column of σ_y is [-i; 0], so second element:

(2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3.

Second row of Z: [1/4, 1/3] times σ_y columns:

First column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = (i)/3.

Second column: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = - i/4.

Thus, Z σ_y is:

[ i/4      -2i/3 ]

[ i/3      -i/4 ]

Now, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements:

(i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. Wait, that's zero? So the trace of Z σ_y is zero, so r_y would be 2 * 0 = 0. Wait, that's zero. But the question states that all components are non-zero. Hmm. Did I do that right?

Wait, let's double-check. Maybe I made an error in the multiplication.

Wait, let me recompute Z σ_y step by step.

First row first column:

First entry of first row of Z (2/3) multiplied by first entry of first column of σ_y (0) plus second entry of first row of Z (1/4) multiplied by second entry of first column of σ_y (i) gives:

(2/3)*0 + (1/4)*i = i/4.

First row second column:

First entry of first row of Z (2/3) times first entry of second column of σ_y (-i) plus second entry of first row of Z (1/4) times second entry of second column of σ_y (0):

(2/3)*(-i) + (1/4)*0 = -2i/3.

Second row first column:

First entry of second row of Z (1/4) times first entry of first column of σ_y (0) plus second entry of second row of Z (1/3) times second entry of first column of σ_y (i):

(1/4)*0 + (1/3)*i = i/3.

Second row second column:

First entry of second row of Z (1/4) times first entry of second column of σ_y (-i) plus second entry of second row of Z (1/3) times second entry of second column of σ_y (0):

(1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0 = -i/4.

Therefore, the trace of Z σ_y is indeed (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So r_y = 0? But that contradicts the correct answer which states that every component is non-zero. Hmm. So either I made a mistake in calculation, or maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait a minute, let me check again. The user wrote the matrix as Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). So the off-diagonal entries are 1/4. However, in the calculation for r_y, the trace came out to zero. If that's the case, then the y component is zero. But the correct answer is supposed to be that every component is non-zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the trace calculation. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe the user's matrix is written as (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3), which is correct. Let me try a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bloch vector components can be computed directly from the matrix entries.

Wait, maybe there's a formula where for a density matrix:

ρ = [ a   b ]

     [ b*  d ]

Then, the Bloch vector components are:

r_x = 2 Re(b)

r_y = -2 Im(b)

r_z = 2(a - d)

Because, if we write the Pauli decomposition:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

Therefore, solving for the coefficients. Let me see.

Starting with:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

Then,

2ρ = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z

Taking the trace of both sides, trace(2ρ) = trace(I) + 0 + 0 + 0, since the trace of Pauli matrices is zero. So 2*(trace ρ) = 2 (since trace of density matrix is 1). So that holds.

Now, to get the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z, we can take the trace with each Pauli matrix.

For example, trace(2ρ σ_x) = trace(I σ_x) + r_x trace(σ_x^2) + r_y trace(σ_y σ_x) + r_z trace(σ_z σ_x)

But trace(I σ_x) is zero, since σ_x trace is zero. Similarly, trace(σ_y σ_x) and trace(σ_z σ_x) are also zero because they are different Pauli matrices, which are trace orthogonal. Only trace(σ_x^2) = trace(I) = 2. So:

trace(2ρ σ_x) = r_x * 2

Therefore, r_x = trace(ρ σ_x). Wait, but in my previous calculation for r_x I had 2 tr(ρ σ_x). Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, according to this, if 2ρ = I + ... then:

trace(2ρ σ_x) = r_x * 2, so r_x = trace(ρ σ_x). Wait but above I thought it was 2 tr(ρ σ_x). Hmm, conflicting results. Let me get this straight.

Wait, let me re-derive:

Let me write the equation:

2ρ = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z

Multiply both sides by σ_x and trace both sides:

trace(2ρ σ_x) = trace(I σ_x) + r_x trace(σ_x^2) + r_y trace(σ_y σ_x) + r_z trace(σ_z σ_x)

trace(I σ_x) = 0

trace(σ_x^2) = trace(I) = 2 (since σ_x squared is I)

trace(σ_y σ_x) = trace(i σ_z) (since σ_x σ_y = i σ_z) which is zero.

Similarly trace(σ_z σ_x) = 0, since they anti-commute.

Therefore:

trace(2ρ σ_x) = r_x * 2

Therefore, r_x = [trace(2ρ σ_x)] / 2 = trace(ρ σ_x)

Wait, so actually, r_x = trace(ρ σ_x). Similarly for others. So my initial approach was wrong, because I thought it was 2 trace(ρ σ_i), but actually it's just trace(ρ σ_i). Wait, but then in the previous calculation for r_z, I had trace(Z σ_z) = 1/3, so r_z is 1/3? Wait, but that contradicts with the earlier calculation where I thought it was 2 times that. Hmm.

Wait, confusion here. Let me clarify once and for all.

The standard expansion is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, so multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2ρ = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. 

Therefore, rearranged, r_x σ_x is part of 2ρ - I. 

Therefore, to get r_x, take the trace with σ_x:

trace( (2ρ - I) σ_x ) = r_x trace(σ_x^2). 

Since trace(I σ_x)=0,

So:

trace(2ρ σ_x) - trace(I σ_x) = r_x trace(σ_x^2)

But trace(I σ_x)=0,

Thus,

trace(2ρ σ_x) = r_x * 2 (since trace σ_x^2 is 2)

Therefore,

r_x = [trace(2ρ σ_x)] / 2 = trace(ρ σ_x)

Wait, so it is trace(ρ σ_x). Therefore, my original calculation where I thought it was 2 trace(ρ σ_x) was wrong, sorry, so actually, each r_i = trace(ρ σ_i). Let me recalculate with that in mind.

So let me redo all three components properly:

Starting again with Z = [2/3  1/4; 1/4 1/3 ]

First, r_z = trace(Z σ_z).

Compute σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Multiply Z and σ_z:

Wait, no, actually, the trace of Z σ_z is the same as the trace of σ_z Z since trace(AB) = trace(BA).

Alternatively, since all entries are numbers, let me compute element-wise.

Z σ_z:

First element (1,1): (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3.

First element (1,2): (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4.

Second element (2,1): (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4.

Second element (2,2): (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3.

So the trace is (2/3) + (-1/3) = 1/3. Therefore, r_z = trace(Z σ_z) = 1/3. So that's correct. So r_z is 1/3, non-zero.

r_x = trace(Z σ_x). σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Z σ_x first:

First element (1,1): (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1) = 1/4.

First element (1,2): (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3.

Second element (2,1): (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(1) = 1/3.

Second element (2,2): (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4.

Thus, Z σ_x is:

[1/4    2/3]

[1/3    1/4]

Trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Therefore, r_x = 1/2. Non-zero.

r_y = trace(Z σ_y). σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Computing trace of Z σ_y:

First, compute Z σ_y:

First element (1,1): (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = (i)/4.

First element (1,2): (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3.

Second element (2,1): (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3.

Second element (2,2): (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4.

So the matrix Z σ_y is:

[ i/4      -2i/3 ]

[ i/3      -i/4 ]

The trace is (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So r_y = 0. 

Wait, so according to this calculation, the y-component is zero, but the correct answer says "every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero". Hmm, so there must be an error here. Let me check my calculations again step by step.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when computing the trace of Z σ_y, the trace is a complex number, so taking the real or imaginary parts? Wait no, trace is just the sum of diagonal elements, which can be complex. But the Bloch vector components are real numbers. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the formula. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for the Bloch vector components when using the Pauli matrices is as follows:

Given ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2,

Then,

r_x = Tr(ρ σ_x),

r_y = Tr(ρ σ_y),

r_z = Tr(ρ σ_z).

So even though σ_y has imaginary components, the trace can still be a complex number? But since ρ is a valid density matrix, which is Hermitian, and σ_y is Hermitian, the trace Tr(ρ σ_y) should be real?

Wait, but in our case, the trace came out as zero, but let me see:

Wait, the trace of Z σ_y is (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0, which is real (zero). So that's okay. So r_y = 0. So that suggests the y-component is zero. But the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. Contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute trace(Z σ_y) again. Let me compute the trace by another method. Let me compute the trace as the sum over diagonal elements of Z multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements of σ_y? Wait, no, trace(AB) isn't the same as the element-wise product unless they are diagonal. Since σ_y is not diagonal, that approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the trace correctly. Let me recompute Z σ_y. 

First element (1,1) of Z σ_y: row 1 of Z times column 1 of σ_y. Column 1 of σ_y is [0; i]. So (2/3)*0 + (1/4)*i = i/4. Correct.

Element (2,2): row 2 of Z times column 2 of σ_y. Column 2 of σ_y is [-i; 0]. So (1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0 = -i/4. Correct.

Therefore, the trace is indeed (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So that's correct. Therefore, r_y = 0. So that component is zero. But the correct answer says all components are non-zero. There must be a mistake here. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait the problem says:

"Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. ?"

Wait, maybe I misread the matrix Z? Let me check again. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So the entries are:

Top left: 2/3, top right: 1/4,

Bottom left: 1/4, bottom right:1/3.

So that's the matrix. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the off-diagonal elements are complex? The problem lists Z as (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). Since the other matrices have imaginary numbers in their off-diagonal elements, like W has (i/4, -i/4), but for Z, maybe the off-diagonal is 1/4 and 1/4, which are real? So that would make the off-diagonal entries real, so their imaginary part is zero, which would mean that r_y is zero. Because the imaginary part of the off-diagonal terms contribute to r_y. 

Wait, let's think of another method. The formula for the Bloch vector components in terms of the matrix entries. Let me recall that for a density matrix:

ρ = [ a         b      ]

     [ b*        d      ]

Then,

r_x = 2 Re(b),

r_y = -2 Im(b),

r_z = 2(a - d).

Ah! This is a better approach, because perhaps this is more straightforward. Let's try this.

Given Z has entries:

a = 2/3,

b = 1/4,

d = 1/3.

But wait, since the matrix is Hermitian? Let me check if Z is Hermitian. The given matrix Z is real? Because the entries are all real? The off-diagonal terms are real numbers. Therefore, the (1,2) entry is 1/4, and (2,1) is also 1/4, so it is Hermitian. Therefore, b is a real number, so the imaginary part of b is zero. Therefore, r_y = -2 Im(b) = 0. Therefore, the y component is zero, which is conflicting with the answer. So according to this, the y-component is zero. But the question states that the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. Hmm. 

Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me check the other matrices to see if maybe I was supposed to choose Z as the correct answer where all components are non-zero, but according to this, Z has a zero component. Maybe I made a mistake in transcribing the matrix?

Wait let me check the user's input again:

The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So, first row is 2/3, 1/4; second row is 1/4, 1/3. That's as I thought. So the off-diagonal entries are real. So then the y component is zero. But the correct answer is supposed to be that every component of Z is non-zero. There's a discrepancy here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me confirm the formula for the Bloch vector components. Let me check a source.

Looking it up: The Bloch vector components can indeed be calculated as follows for a density matrix:

If ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], then since it's Hermitian, c = b*. The Bloch vector is (r_x, r_y, r_z) where:

r_x = 2 Re(b),

r_y = 2 Im(b),

r_z = 2(a - d).

Wait, wait, perhaps there was a sign error in my initial consideration. Let me check again.

Wait, different sources might define it slightly differently. Let me see. Wait, according to Wikipedia, the Bloch vector is defined such that:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2,

Therefore, expanding:

ρ = [ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ]

    [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ]

Comparing to the density matrix:

ρ = [[a, b], [b*, d]]

Therefore:

a = (1 + r_z)/2,

d = (1 - r_z)/2,

b = (r_x - i r_y)/2,

b* = (r_x + i r_y)/2,

So from this,

r_z = 2(a - d),

r_x = 2 Re(b),

r_y = -2 Im(b).

Yes, so the formula is correct. Therefore, if the off-diagonal entry b is real, then r_y = -2 times the imaginary part of b, which is zero. Therefore, r_y is zero. So for matrix Z, since b is 1/4 (real), then r_y is zero.

Therefore, according to this, Z's Bloch vector has a zero component (the y-component). Therefore, the correct answer should not be Z. But the user says the correct answer is that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. This is a contradiction. 

Hmm, so maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misread the entries of Z? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the user wrote Z as (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the off-diagonal elements are complex. For example, maybe the correct Z has off-diagonal elements with imaginary components? Let me check the other matrices to see if perhaps I misread the question.

Looking at the other matrices:

W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So its off-diagonal entries are imaginary.

X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Here, the off-diagonal entries are 1 and 1, which are real. So the Bloch vector for X would have y-component zero?

Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). Its off-diagonal entries are imaginary.

Z is (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). Real off-diagonal entries.

So according to this, the only matrices with non-zero y-components are W and Y, since their off-diagonal entries are imaginary. X and Z have real off-diagonal entries, leading to zero y-components.

Therefore, the only matrix with all components non-zero would be one where both the diagonal terms are different (so r_z non-zero) and the off-diagonal terms have non-zero imaginary parts (so r_x and r_y non-zero). 

Looking at the matrices:

W: diagonal terms are 1/2 and 1/2, so a = 1/2, d =1/2, so r_z = 2*(1/2 - 1/2) =0. Wait a minute, hold on. Wait for W:

For W:

a =1/2,

d=1/2,

so r_z = 2*(1/2 -1/2)=0. Hmm, so even though off-diagonal terms are imaginary, the z component is zero. Because the diagonal entries are equal. So then, r_z is zero, so W's Bloch vector has z-component zero. Hmm.

Similarly for Y:

Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2). So a=1/2, d=1/2, so r_z is zero again. So Y also has zero z-component.

Matrix X: (1/3,1;1,2/3). So a=1/3, d=2/3. So r_z = 2*(1/3 - 2/3)= -2/3, which is non-zero. The off-diagonal terms are real, so r_y is zero. So X has components r_z = -2/3, r_x = 2 Re(b)= 2*(1)=2, and r_y=0. So X has a zero component.

Matrix Z: a=2/3, d=1/3. So r_z =2*(2/3 -1/3)= 2*(1/3)= 2/3. r_x = 2 Re(b)=2*(1/4)=1/2. r_y = -2 Im(b)=0. So Z has components: r_x=1/2, r_y=0, r_z=2/3. So only r_y is zero. 

Wait, so actually, there's no matrix here where all three components are non-zero. Wait that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check each matrix again:

Looking at matrix X: entries are (1/3,1; 1,2/3)

So a =1/3, d=2/3. So r_z=2*(1/3 -2/3)= -2/3 (non-zero).

The off-diagonal entries are b =1, which is real, so Re(b)=1, Im(b)=0. Thus, r_x=2*1=2, r_y= -2*0=0. So X has r_y=0. So only two components non-zero.

Matrix Y: (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). Here, a=1/2, d=1/2, so r_z=0. The off-diagonal terms are (i/3) and (-i/3). So b =i/3. Therefore, Re(b)=0, Im(b)=1/3. Therefore, r_x = 2*0 =0, r_y= -2*(1/3)= -2/3 (Wait, according to formula r_y = -2 Im(b). Since Im(b) is 1/3, so r_y is -2*(1/3)= -2/3. So the components are r_x=0, r_y= -2/3, and r_z=0. So only r_y is non-zero? Wait no:

Wait, hold on. Because b is (i/3), so Re(b)=0, Im(b)=1/3. So r_x = 2*0=0, r_y = -2*(Im(b)) = -2*(1/3)= -2/3. And r_z is zero. So Y has only r_y non-zero (and r_z zero). So only one component non-zero.

Matrix W: (1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2). So a=1/2, d=1/2, so r_z=0. The off-diagonal term b is i/4. So Re(b)=0, Im(b)=1/4. So r_x=0, r_y = -2*(1/4)= -1/2. So W also has only r_y non-zero.

So only matrices X and Z have two non-zero components. The problem states that the correct answer is that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. But according to my calculations, Z has r_y zero. 

Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the problem? Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of r_x for Z?

Wait let me recalculate r_x for Z using the formula r_x = 2 Re(b). For matrix Z, the off-diagonal term b is 1/4. Since it's real, Re(b)=1/4. Therefore, r_x = 2*(1/4)=1/2. Correct, so that's non-zero. The z-component is 2/3. So the only zero component is r_y. 

So according to this, there is no matrix among W, X, Y, Z with all three components non-zero. But the question says the correct answer is Z has all components non-zero. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake, or I have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula for r_y. Let me check again:

If the off-diagonal entry is b = (r_x - i r_y)/2. Therefore, solving for r_x and r_y:

r_x = 2 Re(b),

r_y = -2 Im(b).

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the off-diagonal matrix entries are given as complex numbers for Z? Let me check again. The user wrote Z as (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). If that's the case, the off-diagonal entries are real. But if there was a typo and the off-diagonal entries are like i/4 or something, then the r_y would be non-zero.

Alternatively, maybe the user presented the matrices differently, like maybe some other components. Wait, let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So, according to this, Z has real off-diagonal, so y-component zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking which matrix has all components non-zero, and the answer is none? But the user says the correct answer is Z. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the components being non-zero in absolute value, but in another way. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating r_x. Let me see. For Z, using the Pauli basis method:

r_x = Tr(ρ σ_x). For Z, as computed earlier, was 1/2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user considers the components in a different parametrization where the coefficients are different. But I don't think so. 

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculating the trace of Z σ_y. Wait, let me see:

Z σ_y:

As before, the (1,1) entry is i/4, (2,2) is -i/4, so trace is i/4 -i/4 = 0. So r_y =0. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. 

Wait, perhaps the user actually meant matrix Y or W? Let me check Y's components again. 

For Y: the matrix is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). 

So a = 1/2, d=1/2. So r_z = 2*(1/2 -1/2)=0. 

b =i/3. 

Therefore, r_x = 2 Re(b)=0, r_y = -2 Im(b)= -2*(1/3)= -2/3.

So the only non-zero components are r_y. 

Wait, so Y has only one component non-zero. 

Matrix W: (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

Same as Y, but the off-diagonal is i/4. 

So r_x =0, r_y = -2*(1/4)= -1/2, and r_z=0. 

Thus, W has only r_y non-zero. 

Matrix X has two non-zero components (r_x and r_z). 

Matrix Z has two non-zero components (r_x and r_z), and r_y=0.

Therefore, none of these matrices have all three components non-zero. 

Therefore, the original question might have a mistake
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem here about Bloch vectors and these matrices W, X, Y, and Z. The question is asking why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Hmm, first, let me recall what a Bloch vector is. 

From what I remember, any qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The general form is something like |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)|1⟩, right? And the Bloch vector components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically, if I have a density matrix ρ for a qubit, the Bloch vector (x, y, z) can be found using the trace of ρ with each of the Pauli matrices: x = Tr(ρ σ_x), y = Tr(ρ σ_y), z = Tr(ρ σ_z). 

So, to find the Bloch vector components for each matrix, I need to compute the traces of each matrix multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices. Let me start with matrix Z since that's the one in question. Wait, but hold on, the matrix they're calling Z here might not be the same as the Pauli-Z matrix. Let me check the given matrices again.

They provided:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Okay, so their Z matrix is different from the Pauli-Z matrix which is usually [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Z here is a 2x2 matrix with entries (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). Since it's a density matrix, it should be Hermitian, and trace 1. Let me check that first. The trace of Z is (2/3 + 1/3) = 1, so that's good. The entries off the diagonal are 1/4 and -i times something? Wait, no, the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are both 1/4. Wait, but the Pauli matrices have imaginary off-diagonal terms for Y, but real for X? Hmm, maybe I need to confirm if Z is Hermitian. The transpose of Z would be the same as itself since the off-diagonal elements are real, so yes, it's Hermitian. So that's a valid density matrix.

Now, the Bloch vector components for Z would require calculating Tr(Z σ_x), Tr(Z σ_y), and Tr(Z σ_z). Let's do each of those.

First, let's recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, let's compute Tr(Z σ_x):

Z is:

[2/3  1/4]

[1/4  1/3]

Multiply by σ_x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The multiplication would be:

First row: [2/3*0 + 1/4*1, 2/3*1 + 1/4*0] ?

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication for Tr(Z σ_x) needs to compute Z multiplied by σ_x, then trace the result.

Wait, actually, the trace of the product Z σ_x is the sum of the diagonal elements of Z σ_x.

Alternatively, since trace(AB) = trace(BA), so maybe it's easier to do σ_x Z and then trace?

Wait, but maybe it's better to just compute Z σ_x first.

Let me compute Z multiplied by σ_x:

Z is:

Row 1: [2/3, 1/4]

Row 2: [1/4, 1/3]

Multiply by σ_x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]):

First row of Z times first column of σ_x: (2/3)*0 + (1/4)*1 = 1/4

First row of Z times second column of σ_x: (2/3)*1 + (1/4)*0 = 2/3

Second row of Z times first column of σ_x: (1/4)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3

Second row of Z times second column of σ_x: (1/4)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 1/4

Wait, actually, when multiplying matrices, the element at row i, column j is the dot product of row i of the first matrix and column j of the second matrix. 

So Z * σ_x is computed as:

First row:

First element: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1) = 1/4

Second element: (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

Second row:

First element: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(1) = 1/3

Second element: (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

So Z * σ_x matrix is:

[1/4, 2/3]

[1/3, 1/4]

Then the trace of this is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Wait, 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2? Wait, but the first diagonal element is 1/4, second is 1/4. Wait, so trace is 1/2? Hmm.

Wait, let's check again:

First element (1,1): 1/4, second (2,2): 1/4. So total trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So Tr(Z σ_x) = 1/2.

Okay, that's the x-component. 

Now Tr(Z σ_y):

First, compute Z σ_y. The Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

Multiplying Z (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3) by σ_y:

First row:

First element: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = (i)/4

Second element: (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3

Second row:

First element: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = (i)/3

Second element: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = - (i)/4

So the matrix Z σ_y is:

[ i/4, -2i/3 ]

[ i/3,  -i/4 ]

The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. Wait, that's zero? Hmm. Wait, let me check again:

Wait, first diagonal element is i/4, second is -i/4. So adding them together: (i/4 - i/4) = 0. So Tr(Z σ_y) = 0? But that contradicts the question's answer that Z has all components non-zero. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it another way. Let me try using trace(σ_y Z). Since trace(AB) = trace(BA). So instead of Z σ_y, maybe compute σ_y Z and take its trace.

Wait, let's do that to check:

Compute σ_y * Z. 

σ_y is:

[0, -i]

[i, 0]

Multiply by Z:

First row:

[0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4), 0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3)]

= [ -i/4, -i/3 ]

Second row:

[i*(2/3) + 0*(1/4), i*(1/4) + 0*(1/3)]

= [ 2i/3, i/4 ]

So the matrix σ_y Z is:

[ -i/4, -i/3 ]

[ 2i/3,  i/4 ]

Trace is (-i/4 + i/4) = 0. Same as before. So Tr(Z σ_y)=0. Hmm. Then that would mean the y-component is zero? But the question says that all components are non-zero. Wait, that's a problem. 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again:

Wait, in the first calculation:

First row of Z times first column of σ_y:

First element of first row of Z is 2/3 multiplied by first column of σ_y which is 0 and i (but wait, actually the columns of σ_y are [0; i] and [-i; 0]. Wait, actually, when multiplying Z (first row: [2/3, 1/4]) by σ_y's first column (which is first column of σ_y: first entry 0, second entry i), then the first element of Z σ_y first column is (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4. Similarly, the second column of σ_y is first entry -i, second entry 0. So second element of first row is (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = -2i/3. That's correct. 

Second row of Z is [1/4, 1/3]. Multiplying by σ_y's first column [0; i], so first element of second row is (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3. Second column entry is (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4. So trace is i/4 -i/4 = 0. Hmm. So this is zero. That's an issue. 

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. But here, the y-component is zero? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect? Or maybe I messed up in the calculation?

Wait, hold on. Let's check the question again. It says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So maybe I did a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the density matrix, but in some different way? Wait, maybe I need to compute the Bloch vector components differently. Wait, the standard formula is:

For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are:

x = Tr[ρ σ_x], y = Tr[ρ σ_y], z = Tr[ρ σ_z]

So, yes, exactly as I did. So if the y-component is zero, then the answer would not be correct. Hmm. But maybe I made a mistake in calculation?

Wait let me check again:

Compute Tr(Z σ_y):

Z is [[2/3,1/4],[1/4,1/3]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

So, the product Z σ_y:

First row first column: 2/3 * 0 + 1/4 * i = i/4

First row second column: 2/3 * (-i) + 1/4 * 0 = -2i/3

Second row first column: 1/4 *0 +1/3 *i = i/3

Second row second column:1/4*(-i) +1/3 *0 = -i/4

Thus trace is (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So that's correct. Hmm.

Wait so according to this, the y-component is zero. But the question is claiming that all components are non-zero. So that suggests that either I'm wrong or maybe I misread the matrix?

Wait let me check the matrix Z again. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So that's first row [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. Yes, that's what I used. So maybe that's the case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the trace formula? Wait, maybe it's Tr(σ_y Z) instead? But trace(σ_y Z) = trace( Z σ_y ), so that's the same thing. 

Hmm, so that suggests that the y-component is zero. But according to the question, the answer is that all components are non-zero, so maybe I made a mistake in another component?

Wait, let's check the z-component. Tr(Z σ_z). 

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

Multiplying Z by σ_z:

Z * σ_z = [[2/3 *1 +1/4*0, 2/3*0 +1/4*(-1)], [1/4*1 +1/3*0, 1/4*0 +1/3*(-1)]]

Wait, actually, let's compute element by element:

First row first column: 2/3 * 1 = 2/3

First row second column:1/4*(-1) = -1/4

Second row first column:1/4*1 =1/4

Second row second column:1/3*(-1) = -1/3

So the matrix Z σ_z is:

[2/3, -1/4]

[1/4, -1/3]

Trace is 2/3 + (-1/3) = (2/3 -1/3)=1/3. So Tr(Z σ_z) =1/3. So z-component is 1/3, which is non-zero. 

Wait, okay, so the z-component is 1/3, which is non-zero, x-component is 1/2, which is non-zero, but y-component is 0. Therefore, the statement "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero" would be false, but the question says that this is the correct answer. Hmm, so something is wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix Z was written incorrectly? Let me check the given matrices again.

Original problem says:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Yes, that's what's written. So Z's off-diagonal entries are both 1/4, which are real. Since σ_y involves imaginary numbers, the product with Z (which has real off-diagonal entries) would lead to imaginary terms, and when taking the trace, they can cancel. 

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to a different matrix? Wait, could there be a typo? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the off-diagonal terms in Z are complex? Wait, the problem says the format is semicolon separated rows, so Z is first row [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. So the entries are real. Therefore, when multiplied by σ_y (which has imaginary entries), the off-diagonal terms will be imaginary. But since the coefficients are real, their contributions in the trace (which requires adding the diagonal elements) might cancel. 

Wait, so in that case, the y-component is indeed zero, so the correct answer would not be that all components are non-zero. But the question states that the correct answer is that. So this is a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is written differently? Let me check again:

The user wrote:

"Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero."

Wait, maybe the other matrices have some components zero, and the question is asking which of them has all components non-zero. But the user didn't give the options here. Wait, actually, the user says "Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?" So perhaps the user is indicating that the correct answer is that, but according to my calculation, that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I did a miscalculation in the y-component. Let me check again.

Wait, let's see:

The trace of Z σ_y is the sum of the diagonals of Z σ_y which we found to be (i/4 and -i/4). So adding them gives zero. So that's correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the off-diagonal terms as components? Wait, no, the Bloch vector is defined via the Pauli matrices' expectation values.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix Z is actually the density matrix of a pure state? Let me check if Z is a pure state. For a pure state, the density matrix squared should equal itself. Let me check Z^2:

Z is:

[2/3  1/4

1/4  1/3]

Z squared:

First row first column: (2/3)^2 + (1/4)(1/4) = 4/9 + 1/16 = (64 + 9)/144 = 73/144

Wait, actually, need to compute properly:

First element:

(2/3)(2/3) + (1/4)(1/4) = (4/9) + (1/16) = (64 + 9)/144 = 73/144 ≈ 0.5069

First row second column:

(2/3)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/3) = (2/12) + (1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4

Second row first column same as first row second column, so 1/4

Second row second column:

(1/4)(1/4) + (1/3)(1/3) = 1/16 + 1/9 = (9 +16)/144 =25/144≈0.1736

So Z^2 is:

[73/144, 1/4

1/4, 25/144]

Which is not equal to Z, since Z's diagonal entries are 2/3 ≈0.666 and 1/3≈0.333, which do not match 73/144≈0.5069 and 25/144≈0.1736. So it's not a pure state. Then the Bloch vector components are as per the trace.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that I'm miscalculating the σ_y trace? Let me try a different approach. Let me represent the density matrix Z in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form for a 2x2 matrix is:

ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2

Therefore, the coefficients x, y, z are the Bloch components. So, if I can write Z in this form, I can read off the components.

Let me write Z = (1/2)(I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z). 

Let me compute the right-hand side:

(1/2)(I) = [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]

(1/2)(x σ_x) = (x/2)[[0,1],[1,0]]

(1/2)(y σ_y) = (y/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]

(1/2)(z σ_z) = (z/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding all together:

The (1,1) component: (1/2) + (y/2)(0) + (z/2)(1) = 1/2 + z/2

The (1,2) component: (x/2)(1) + (y/2)(-i) 

Similarly, (2,1) component: (x/2)(1) + (y/2)(i)

The (2,2) component: (1/2) + (z/2)(-1) = 1/2 - z/2

So equate to matrix Z:

Z is [[2/3, 1/4],[1/4, 1/3]]

So equate (1,1):

1/2 + z/2 = 2/3 → z/2 = 2/3 - 1/2 = (4/6 - 3/6) =1/6 → z =1/3. That's consistent with earlier.

(2,2):

1/2 - z/2 =1/3 → 1/2 - (1/3)/2 = 1/2 -1/6= 1/3, which matches.

Now the (1,2) component:

(x/2) + (y/2)(-i) =1/4 (since Z's (1,2) is 1/4, which is real). 

Similarly, (2,1):

(x/2) + (y/2)(i)=1/4. 

Since the matrix Z has real off-diagonal entries (1/4), the imaginary parts must cancel out. Therefore, the terms with y must be zero. Let me see:

So the off-diagonal entries:

For (1,2):

(x/2) - (y i)/2 =1/4 (real)

Similarly, (2,1):

(x/2) + (y i)/2 =1/4 (which is also real)

Therefore, the imaginary parts must be zero. 

Looking at the (1,2) component:

The imaginary part is - (y/2)i. For this to be zero, since the left-hand side is real (1/4), the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore, - (y/2)i =0 → y=0. 

Therefore, y must be zero. So that's consistent with the earlier result that y-component is zero. Therefore, the y-component is indeed zero. Hence the answer that "every component is non-zero" is incorrect?

Hmm, but the question says that the correct answer is that. Maybe I need to check the other matrices to see which one has all components non-zero?

Wait, the question says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So maybe there is a mistake here, or perhaps the problem is in the matrices?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the matrix Z. Let me check the other matrices quickly.

Take matrix Y first:

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). So the off-diagonal terms are imaginary. So when computing its Bloch vector:

First, Tr(Y σ_x):

Y * σ_x:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Multiply Y first row: [1/2, i/3] times σ_x first column gives 1/2*0 + (i/3)*1 = i/3

First row second column: (1/2)*1 + (i/3)*0 = 1/2

Second row first column: (-i/3)*0 +1/2 *1 =1/2

Second row second column: (-i/3)*1 +1/2*0 = -i/3

So Z σ_x? Wait, sorry for Y *σ_x:

Resulting matrix:

[i/3, 1/2]

[1/2, -i/3]

The trace is i/3 -i/3=0. So x-component is zero. Hmm.

Wait, but Y's (x component):

Tr(Y σ_x) would be trace(Y σ_x). Let me compute again properly.

Wait, maybe using the Pauli decomposition approach.

Alternatively, let me compute Tr(Y σ_x):

Y is [[1/2, i/3],[ -i/3,1/2]]

Multiply by σ_x:

σ_x Y:

First row: [0,1] * first column Y: first entry 0*(1/2) +1*(-i/3)= -i/3

Wait, maybe better to compute trace(Y σ_x):

The trace is the sum over i,j Y_{i,j} (σ_x)_{j,i}

Wait alternatively, since trace(Y σ_x) = trace(σ_x Y). Let me compute σ_x times Y:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y=[[1/2, i/3],[ -i/3, 1/2]]

σ_x * Y:

First row first column:0*(1/2) +1*(-i/3)= -i/3

First row second column:0*(i/3) +1*(1/2)=1/2

Second row first column:1*(1/2) +0*(-i/3)=1/2

Second row second column:1*(i/3) +0*(1/2)=i/3

Thus σ_x Y matrix is:

[ -i/3, 1/2 ]

[1/2, i/3 ]

Trace is (-i/3 +i/3)=0. So Tr(Y σ_x)=0. So x-component is zero for Y's Bloch vector. Hmm.

Wait, the y-component for Y:

Tr(Y σ_y). Let's compute that.

Compute Y σ_y:

Y is [[1/2, i/3],[ -i/3,1/2]]

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]

Multiply Y by σ_y:

First row first column: (1/2)*0 + (i/3)*i = (i^2)/3 = -1/3

First row second column: (1/2)*(-i) + (i/3)*0 = -i/2

Second row first column: (-i/3)*0 + (1/2)*i = i/2

Second row second column: (-i/3)*(-i) + (1/2)*0 = (i^2)/3 = -1/3

Thus Y σ_y matrix:

[ -1/3, -i/2 ]

[ i/2, -1/3 ]

Trace is (-1/3) + (-1/3)= -2/3. But since trace(Y σ_y)= -2/3, which is real? Wait, but σ_y is imaginary, so Y σ_y would have complex entries? Wait, but the trace here is real?

Wait, the trace of Y σ_y is the sum of the diagonal elements, which are -1/3 and -1/3. So that's -2/3. So the y-component is -2/3, which is non-zero.

Then the z-component for Y:

Tr(Y σ_z):

Y is [[1/2, i/3],[ -i/3,1/2]]

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Multiplying Y by σ_z:

First row first: 1/2*1 =1/2, first row second: i/3*0=0

Second row first: -i/3*0=0, second row second:1/2*(-1)= -1/2

So Y σ_z matrix:

[1/2, 0]

[0, -1/2]

Trace is 1/2 -1/2 =0. So z-component is zero. 

Thus Y's Bloch vector has x=0, y=-2/3, z=0. Not all components non-zero.

Hmm.

Now matrix X:

X is (1/3,1;1,2/3)

So first row [1/3,1], second [1, 2/3]

Check if Hermitian? Since the off-diagonal entries are both 1, which are real, so yes, Hermitian. Trace:1/3 +2/3=1. Good.

Compute its Bloch vector components.

x-component: Tr(X σ_x). 

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

X * σ_x:

First row first column: (1/3)*0 +1*1=1

First row second column: (1/3)*1 +1*0=1/3

Second row first column:1*0 + (2/3)*1=2/3

Second row second column:1*1 + (2/3)*0=1

Thus X σ_x matrix:

[1, 1/3]

[2/3, 1 ]

Trace is 1 +1=2. So Tr(X σ_x)=2. 

Wait, but the trace of a product with Pauli matrices can't be larger than 2? Wait, but the Bloch vector components are usually scaled such that the maximum is 1 for a pure state. Wait, actually, in the standard Bloch vector, the components x,y,z are given by Tr(ρ σ_x), etc., so for a density matrix, the trace would be between -1 and 1. Wait, but here, the trace is 2? That can't be. Wait, hold on, perhaps miscalculation.

Let me recompute Tr(X σ_x). 

Wait, X is [[1/3,1],[1,2/3]], σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Multiplying them:

First row first column: (0)(1/3) +1*1=1

First row second column: (0)(1) +1*(2/3)= 2/3? Wait, no:

Wait, matrix multiplication step by step.

Wait, sorry, actually, to compute trace(X σ_x), I can do element-wise sum over i,j X_{i,j} (σ_x)_{j,i}

Because trace(AB) = sum_{i,j} A_{i,j} B_{j,i}

So Tr(X σ_x)= X_{1,1} σ_x_{1,1} + X_{1,2} σ_x_{2,1} + X_{2,1} σ_x_{1,2} + X_{2,2} σ_x_{2,2}

But σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:

= (1/3)(0) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (2/3)(0) =0 +1 +1 +0 =2. 

But for a density matrix, Tr(ρ σ_x) can't exceed 1 in absolute value, because σ_x is Hermitian with eigenvalues ±1, so expectation value between -1 and 1. But here it's 2, which is impossible. That suggests that this is not a valid density matrix?

Wait, but the trace of X is 1/3 + 2/3 =1. And it's Hermitian. Wait, but then the operator norm? Maybe it has eigenvalues outside [0,1], making it invalid?

Wait, check eigenvalues of X. Let me compute determinant:

 determinant(X) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9 -1)= (2/9 -9/9)= -7/9 <0

Thus, one eigenvalue positive and one negative? That would mean it's not positive semi-definite. So X is not a valid density matrix. The problem statement must have a typo, or maybe I misread? 

Wait the user wrote:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Is that correct? Maybe the semicolon separates rows, so yes, first row [1/3,1], second row [1,2/3]. That seems to be the case. But then X is not a valid density matrix because it's not positive semi-definite. Since determinant is negative. That's a problem. 

Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in entering the matrices? Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, they are considering something else. 

Moving on to matrix W:

W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2). Let's check its Bloch vector.

First, trace(W σ_x):

Compute Tr(W σ_x):

W is [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4,1/2]]

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Trace is the sum over i,j W_{i,j} σ_x_{j,i}

So:

W_{1,1} σ_x_{1,1}= (1/2)(0)=0

W_{1,2} σ_x_{2,1}= (i/4)(1)=i/4

W_{2,1} σ_x_{1,2}= (-i/4)(1)= -i/4

W_{2,2} σ_x_{2,2}= (1/2)(0)=0

Total trace: 0 +i/4 -i/4 +0 =0. So x-component is zero.

Now y-component Tr(W σ_y):

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

Compute Tr(W σ_y):

Sum over i,j W_{i,j} σ_y_{j,i}

W_{1,1}*σ_y_{1,1}= (1/2)(0)=0

W_{1,2}*σ_y_{2,1} = (i/4)(i)= (i^2)/4 = -1/4

W_{2,1}*σ_y_{1,2}= (-i/4)(-i)= (i^2)/4 = -1/4

W_{2,2}*σ_y_{2,2}= (1/2)(0)=0

Total trace: 0 -1/4 -1/4 +0 = -1/2. So y-component is -1/2, non-zero.

Z-component Tr(W σ_z):

W is [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4,1/2]], σ_z is diag(1,-1)

Trace: W_{1,1}*1 + W_{2,2}*(-1) = (1/2) - (1/2)=0. So z-component is 0.

Thus W's Bloch vector is (0, -1/2, 0). Not all components non-zero.

Hmm.

So, among the matrices given, which has all components non-zero?

We have:

- W: (0, -1/2,0)

- X: Not a valid density matrix (but components would be (2, ?, ?), but since invalid, maybe discard)

- Y: (0, -2/3,0)

- Z: (1/2,0,1/3). 

Wait, so Z has x=1/2, y=0, z=1/3. So the y-component is zero. So none of the given matrices have all components non-zero except maybe X, but it's invalid. Wait, but according to the problem, the correct answer is Z. But according to calculations, Z's y-component is zero. This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem's matrices? Let me check again the original problem's matrices:

"Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)" 

Wait, maybe the user intended the off-diagonal terms to be imaginary? For instance, if Z's off-diagonal terms were i/4, then the y-component would be non-zero. Let me see:

Suppose Z were written with imaginary off-diagonal terms: 

Z = [[2/3, i/4], [ -i/4,1/3]]

Then, computing the y-component:

Trace(Z σ_y):

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

Multiply Z by σ_y:

First row first column: (2/3)(0) + (i/4)(i)= (i^2)/4 = -1/4

First row second column: (2/3)(-i) + (i/4)(0) = -2i/3

Second row first column: (-i/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3

Second row second column: (-i/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0)= (i^2)/4 = -1/4

Trace is (-1/4) + (-1/4)= -1/2, so y-component would be -1/2. Then all components would be non-zero:

x-component:

Compute Tr(Z σ_x):

Z σ_x with imaginary off-diagonal:

First row first entry: (2/
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Let me start by recalling what a Bloch vector is. 

The Bloch vector represents a qubit state in terms of the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components (let's call them x, y, z) are given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The formula is ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2. So, each component of the Bloch vector is calculated by taking the trace of ρ multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. 

First, let me write down matrix Z again. The user mentioned the format where semicolon separates rows. So Z is:

Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). That means the first row is [2/3, 1/4] and the second row is [1/4, 1/3]. Let me double-check: the first entry is (2/3), then (1/4) in the first row, second column; second row starts with 1/4 and ends with 1/3. Okay, got it.

Now, to compute the Bloch vector components for Z, I need to compute the traces of Z multiplied by σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z, then divide by 2, right? Let me recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the components are:

x = Tr(Z * σ_x) / 2

y = Tr(Z * σ_y) / 2

z = Tr(Z * σ_z) / 2

Let me compute each of these.

Starting with the z-component, since it might be simpler because σ_z is diagonal. 

First, compute Z * σ_z. Since both are diagonal matrices? Wait, no. Wait, Z is:

[2/3, 1/4]

[1/4, 1/3]

And σ_z is:

[1, 0]

[0, -1]

Multiplying Z with σ_z (matrix multiplication):

First row first column: (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

First row second column: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4

Second row first column: (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

Second row second column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3

Wait, but actually, hold on, maybe I need to compute the trace of Z multiplied by σ_z, so perhaps it's Tr(Z σ_z). Let me clarify:

The trace of a matrix product is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product. So first compute Z multiplied by σ_z (element-wise?), no, wait, matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me do Z multiplied by σ_z properly.

Wait, no, actually, the trace of the product is the same as the sum over all entries where you multiply corresponding elements when one matrix is transposed? Hmm, maybe I should just compute the matrix product first then take the trace.

Let me compute Z * σ_z:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4]

First column of σ_z: [1, 0]^T

First element of first row, first column of product: (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

First row, second column: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4

Second row of Z: [1/4, 1/3]

Second row first column: (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

Second row second column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3

So the product Z * σ_z is:

[2/3, -1/4]

[1/4, -1/3]

The trace of this matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements: (2/3) + (-1/3) = 1/3

Therefore, z = (1/3)/2 = 1/6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is Tr(ρ σ_i)/2. Since ρ is already the density matrix, so for ρ = Z, the component z is (Tr(Z σ_z))/2.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure: if the Bloch vector components are given by x = Tr(ρ σ_x), y = Tr(ρ σ_y), z = Tr(ρ σ_z). Wait, actually in the standard formula, the decomposition is ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Therefore, rearranging, we get x = Tr(ρ σ_x) * 2, because:

Multiply both sides by 2: 2ρ = I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z

Take trace with σ_x: Tr(2ρ σ_x) = Tr(σ_x) + x Tr(σ_x^2) + y Tr(σ_x σ_y) + z Tr(σ_x σ_z)

But since σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are traceless except for their squares? Wait, actually, maybe there's a simpler way. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless except σ_z? Wait no, σ_x and σ_y also have trace zero. Wait σ_x trace: 0+0 =0? Wait σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0+0=0. Similarly σ_y and σ_z. Wait σ_z has trace 1 + (-1) = 0? Wait no. Wait σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so trace is 1 -1 =0. Wait, all Pauli matrices except the identity have trace zero. Therefore, when we take the trace of both sides with σ_x:

Tr(2ρ σ_x) = Tr(σ_x σ_x) x, since the cross terms like Tr(σ_x σ_y) are zero because Pauli matrices are orthogonal in trace.

Since Tr(σ_x σ_x) = Tr(I) = 2 (since σ_x squared is I?), Wait σ_x squared is I?

Wait σ_x^2 is [[0,1],[1,0]]^2 = [[1,0],[0,1]] = I. Similarly σ_y^2 = I, σ_z^2 = I. So yes, so Tr(σ_x^2)=Tr(I)=2. Therefore,

Tr(2ρ σ_x) = 2 x => x= Tr(ρ σ_x).

Wait, so actually the formula is x = Tr(ρ σ_x), same for y and z. Therefore, my mistake earlier, I think I had an extra division by 2 there. So correcting that, let's recalculate.

So for the z-component, Tr(Z σ_z). Earlier calculation gave the product Z σ_z has trace 2/3 -1/3 = 1/3. Therefore z = 1/3?

Wait let me recalculate the trace of Z*σ_z again carefully.

Z is:

Row 1: 2/3, 1/4

Row 2: 1/4, 1/3

Multiply by σ_z, which is diag(1, -1):

So the product matrix elements:

First element (1,1): (2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

Second element (1,2): (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(-1) = -1/4

Third element (2,1): (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

Fourth element (2,2): (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = -1/3

So the diagonal entries are 2/3 and -1/3. Hence trace is 2/3 -1/3 = 1/3. Therefore, z = Tr(Z σ_z) =1/3 ≈ 0.333..., which is non-zero. Okay, so z-component is non-zero.

Now, moving on to the x-component. Let's compute Tr(Z * σ_x).

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So compute the product Z * σ_x:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4] multiplied by first column of σ_x, which is [0,1]^T.

First element (1,1): (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1) = 1/4

First row, second column: [2/3,1/4] times second column of σ_x which is [1,0]^T:

(2/3)(1) + (1/4)(0) = 2/3

Second row of Z: [1/4, 1/3] times first column of σ_x [0,1]^T:

(1/4)(0) + (1/3)(1) = 1/3

Second row, second column: [1/4,1/3] times [1,0]^T:

(1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/4

So the product matrix Z * σ_x is:

[1/4, 2/3]

[1/3, 1/4]

Now, the trace is (1/4) + (1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2. Therefore, x = Tr(Z σ_x) = 1/2. So that's non-zero.

Now the y-component. This will involve the σ_y, which has an imaginary unit, so the trace might have an imaginary part. Let me see.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Compute Z * σ_y:

First row of Z: [2/3, 1/4] times first column of σ_y: [0, i]^T (Wait, σ_y's first column is [0; i], second column is [-i; 0]?

Wait σ_y is:

Row 1: [0, -i]

Row 2: [i, 0]

So columns are:

First column: [0, i]

Second column: [-i, 0]

Therefore, multiplying Z with σ_y:

First row, first column: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = (i/4)

First row, second column: (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i/3)

Second row, first column: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3

Second row, second column: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4

Therefore the product matrix Z * σ_y is:

[ i/4 , -2i/3 ]

[ i/3 , -i/4 ]

Now, taking the trace of this matrix: the diagonal entries are i/4 and -i/4. Adding them together: (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. 

Wait, but that would give Tr(Z σ_y) =0, so the y-component is zero? But the answer says all components are non-zero. Hmm, that's conflicting. Did I make a mistake here?

Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the multiplication.

Let me recompute Z * σ_y step by step.

First, the entry (1,1) of the product is first row of Z times first column of σ_y:

Z's first row is [2/3, 1/4]

σ_y's first column is [0; i]

So (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4. That's correct.

Entry (1,2): first row of Z times second column of σ_y (which is [-i; 0]):

(2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3. Correct.

Entry (2,1): second row of Z [1/4, 1/3] times first column of σ_y [0; i]:

(1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3. Correct.

Entry (2,2): second row of Z times second column of σ_y [-i; 0]:

(1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4. Correct.

Therefore trace is (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So Tr(Z σ_y)=0. Therefore y-component is zero. But the answer says every component is non-zero. Hmm, so that would mean I made a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the multiplication order? Because sometimes the trace of A*B is same as trace of B*A, but maybe I should check if the formula requires multiplying in a different order? Let me think.

Wait, the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, so Tr(Z σ_y) = Tr(σ_y Z). Let me compute σ_y Z instead to see if that's different?

Wait, let me try that.

Compute σ_y * Z instead of Z * σ_y. Let's see.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Multiply by Z:

First row of σ_y: [0, -i] multiplied by first column of Z: [2/3; 1/4]

First entry (1,1): 0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

First row, second column: [0, -i] * second column of Z [1/4;1/3]

0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3) = -i/3

Second row of σ_y: [i, 0] multiplied by first column of Z [2/3;1/4]:

i*(2/3) + 0*(1/4) = 2i/3

Second row, second column: [i, 0] * second column of Z [1/4;1/3]:

i*(1/4) + 0*(1/3) = i/4

Therefore σ_y * Z is:

[ -i/4 , -i/3 ]

[ 2i/3, i/4 ]

Trace is (-i/4) + i/4 = 0. Same result. So Tr(σ_y Z) = Tr(Z σ_y)=0. So the y-component is zero. Hmm.

But the answer says "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." But according to this, y-component is zero, so that would be incorrect. Hmm, so either the problem is in my calculation or maybe I misread the matrix?

Wait let me check the matrix Z again. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. So that's correct. So the calculation seems right. Wait but maybe the question is saying "every component is non-zero", but my calculation says y-component is zero, so that would make the correct answer not Z. Wait the options weren't given here, but the user says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?" So perhaps I might have made an error?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the matrix Z? Let me see.

Wait, let me check the other matrices as well, maybe I can cross-verify.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the off-diagonal terms in the matrix Z have a non-zero imaginary part? Wait, in the calculation for the y-component, the trace came out zero because the entries canceled, but maybe the components are not zero? Wait, the trace is zero, so the y-component is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the Bloch vector components. Let me confirm the formula again. 

The standard formula for the Bloch vector components is:

For a density matrix ρ (which is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace 1), we have:

ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2

Therefore, rearranged:

x = Tr(ρ σ_x)

Similarly for y and z. So the components are just the trace of ρ multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So according to my calculation, for matrix Z:

x = 1/2, z=1/3, y=0. Therefore the y-component is zero, so the statement is wrong?

Wait, but the question states "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?" So there must be some mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait maybe I miscalculated the trace for the y-component. Let me see:

Wait when I calculated Z*σ_y, the trace was (i/4) + (-i/4) =0. But is the trace over complex numbers, so real and imaginary parts? Wait, the trace is a complex number here? Hmm, but the density matrix Z is Hermitian, right?

Wait let's check if Z is Hermitian. Z's (2,1) entry is 1/4, and (1,2) is also 1/4, so it's Hermitian since the off-diagonal entries are real. So the density matrix is Hermitian, so the expectation values Tr(ρ σ_i) must be real, because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Wait, but σ_y is Hermitian, so Tr(ρ σ_y) should be real. But in my calculation, I got zero, which is real, so that's okay. 

Wait, but perhaps the problem is in how I multiplied the matrices? Let me see the product Z σ_y again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the matrix entries? Let me see the matrices given again:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, matrix Y has imaginary off-diagonal terms, so maybe when calculating Y's bloch vector, the y-component is non-zero? But the question is about Z.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the off-diagonal terms in the density matrix for the y-component?

Alternatively, maybe the components are calculated differently? Let me think again.

Wait the y-component is given by Tr(ρ σ_y). But σ_y has an imaginary unit, so multiplying by that might lead to an imaginary contribution from the off-diagonal terms. But since ρ is Hermitian, when you take the trace with σ_y, which is also Hermitian, the trace should be real. Let me verify this.

Wait, let's compute Tr(Z * σ_y). Since Z is Hermitian and σ_y is Hermitian, their product Z σ_y is also Hermitian? Wait no, the product of two Hermitian matrices isn't necessarily Hermitian unless they commute. Let me check:

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so σ_y^† = σ_y. Z is Hermitian, so Z† = Z. Then (Z σ_y)^† = σ_y^† Z† = σ_y Z. Since multiplication is not commutative, unless Z and σ_y commute, which they don't necessarily. So the trace of Z σ_y is the same as Tr(σ_y Z) because trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, so Tr(A B) = Tr(B A). 

Therefore, in my calculation, Tr(Z σ_y)=0. However, the trace is zero. So the y-component is zero. 

Hmm, so that contradicts the given answer. Therefore, there must be some mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another way of parameterizing the Bloch vector? Let me check the definition again.

Wait another thought: perhaps the user uses a different convention where the Bloch vector components are scaled differently. Let me see, in some references, the Bloch vector is given by (x, y, z) such that ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. So the components are exactly the traces as I calculated. 

Alternatively, maybe they consider the components as Tr(σ_x ρ), which is the same as Tr(ρ σ_x) because trace is invariant. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the product?

Wait let me recalculate the trace of Z σ_y again. Let me consider the product Z * σ_y:

Z is:

Row1: [2/3, 1/4]

Row2: [1/4, 1/3]

σ_y is:

Row1: [0, -i]

Row2: [i, 0]

Therefore, the product Z * σ_y row by column:

First row first column:

(2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = (i/4)

First row second column:

(2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3

Second row first column:

(1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = (i)/3

Second row second column:

(1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = - (i)/4

Thus the trace is (i/4) + (-i)/4 = 0. 

Hmm, that's correct. Therefore, the y-component is indeed zero. 

Wait, maybe the question is wrong? Or perhaps the matrix Z was transposed?

Wait another thought: maybe the question is about the components of the Bloch vector not being zero in their real and imaginary parts? But the Bloch vector is real by definition.

Alternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation in the x-component?

Wait x-component was Tr(Z σ_x) = 1/2. 

Wait let's recheck:

The product Z σ_x was calculated as:

[1/4, 2/3]

[1/3, 1/4]

Trace is 1/4 +1/4= 1/2. Yes, that's correct.

z-component was 1/3, that's correct.

Therefore, the Bloch vector for Z is (1/2, 0, 1/3). Therefore, the y-component is zero. So the statement "Every component is non-zero" is false. 

But the question says the correct answer is that. So maybe I made a mistake in reading the matrix? Let me check the original problem again.

The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, the format is rows separated by semicolons. So the first entry for Z is first row: 2/3, 1/4; second row: 1/4, 1/3. So that's correct. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake and the matrix Z actually has different entries? Or maybe the problem is not about Z but another matrix?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about matrix Y instead of Z?

Wait let's check matrix Y. Let me compute Y's Bloch vector quickly.

Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). So first row [1/2, i/3], second row [-i/3, 1/2].

Compute its components.

First, z-component: Tr(Y σ_z). 

Y times σ_z:

First row first column: (1/2)(1) + (i/3)(0) = 1/2

First row second column: (1/2)(0) + (i/3)(-1) = -i/3

Second row first column: (-i/3)(1) + (1/2)(0) = -i/3

Second row second column: (-i/3)(0) + (1/2)(-1) = -1/2

Trace is (1/2) + (-1/2) =0. Therefore z-component is 0.

Hmm. Maybe not. Wait, but let's compute properly:

Wait, actually:

Wait, to compute Tr(Y σ_z):

Y * σ_z is:

First row first element (1/2)(1) + (i/3)(0) =1/2

First row second (1/2)(0)+(i/3)(-1)= -i/3

Second row first: (-i/3)(1) + (1/2)(0)= -i/3

Second row second: (-i/3)(0) + (1/2)(-1)= -1/2.

Trace is 1/2 -1/2 =0.

Hmm. So z-component is 0. Not helpful.

What about X? Let me check matrix X:

X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). First row [1/3,1], second row [1, 2/3].

Compute its Bloch components.

First, computing x-component Tr(X σ_x).

Compute X * σ_x:

σ_x is [[0,1], [1,0]]

First row first column: (1/3)(0) + (1)(1) =1

First row second column: (1/3)(1) + (1)(0) = 1/3

Second row first column: (1)(0) + (2/3)(1) =2/3

Second row second column: (1)(1) + (2/3)(0)=1

Trace is 1 +1=2. So x-component is Tr(X σ_x)=2, which is non-zero.

Then z-component Tr(X σ_z):

X * σ_z is:

First row first column: (1/3)(1) +1*0=1/3

First row second column: (1/3)(0) +1*(-1)= -1

Second row first column:1*1 + (2/3)(0)=1

Second row second column:1*0 + (2/3)(-1)= -2/3

Trace:1/3 -2/3 = -1/3. So z-component is -1/3. Non-zero.

y-component Tr(X σ_y):

Compute X*σ_y:

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

First row first column: (1/3)(0) +1*(i)=i

First row second column: (1/3)(-i) +1*(0)= -i/3

Second row first column:1*(0) + (2/3)*(i)= (2i)/3

Second row second column:1*(-i) + (2/3)(0)= -i

Trace is i + (-i)=0. So y-component is zero. So X's Bloch vector is (2, 0, -1/3). Not all components non-zero.

Hmm, so if the question is about Z, then according to my calculations, its y-component is zero, so the answer is wrong. But the user says the correct answer is that every component is non-zero for Z. So I must have made an error.

Wait, let me check the computation of y-component again for Z. Let me go through it step by step again, maybe I missed a sign.

The σ_y matrix is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Z is:

Row1: [2/3, 1/4]

Row2: [1/4, 1/3]

So the product Z * σ_y:

First row:

First element:

Z_row1 • σ_y_col1 = (2/3)*0 + (1/4)*i = (i)/4

Second element:

Z_row1 • σ_y_col2 = (2/3)*(-i) + (1/4)*0 = (-2i)/3

Second row:

First element:

Z_row2 • σ_y_col1 = (1/4)*0 + (1/3)*i = i/3

Second element:

Z_row2 • σ_y_col2 = (1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0 = -i/4

Therefore the trace is (i/4) + (-i/4) =0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the off-diagonal terms in the density matrix as components of the Bloch vector?

Wait, the Bloch vector's components are directly determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, so even if the density matrix has complex entries, their contributions are accounted for in the trace.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula where the components are calculated using the real and imaginary parts? Let me see.

Another approach: for a density matrix:

ρ = [ a      b ]

     [ b*    1 - a ]

Where a is a complex number between 0 and 1, and b is a complex number such that the matrix is Hermitian (so b* is the conjugate of b). 

The Bloch vector components are:

x = 2 Re(b)

y = -2 Im(b)

z = 2a -1

Wait, let me recall that parametrization.

Yes, another way to write the Bloch vector components is:

Given a density matrix in the form:

ρ = [a        b]

     [b^*    1 -a]

then the Bloch vector is (x,y,z) where:

x = 2 Re(b)

y = -2 Im(b)

z = 2a -1

Therefore, let's apply this formula to matrix Z.

First, let's write Z:

Z = [2/3, 1/4]

    [1/4, 1/3]

Here, the off-diagonal term b is 1/4, which is real. Therefore, b* = b =1/4. Since b is real, the imaginary part is zero. Hence,

x = 2 Re(b) = 2*(1/4)= 1/2

y = -2 Im(b) = -2*0=0

z = 2a -1 where a is the (1,1) entry, 2/3. So z = 2*(2/3) -1= 4/3 -1 =1/3

So indeed, y-component is zero. Therefore, in this parametrization, the y-component is zero. Hence, the statement that all components are non-zero is false for Z. 

Hmm. That's conflicting with the question's correct answer. 

Wait, let me check matrix X again using this method.

Matrix X is [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3]

Here, a =1/3, b=1 (real). So x=2*1=2, y=0, z=2*(1/3) -1 = -1/3. Same as before. 

Matrix W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2)

Here, a=1/2, b =i/4 (so complex). Then,

x=2 Re(b)=2*(0)=0

y= -2 Im(b)= -2*(1/4)= -1/2

z=2*(1/2) -1=0. So the Bloch vector is (0, -1/2,0). 

Matrix Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2)

So a=1/2, b =i/3. Hence,

x=2 Re(b)=0,

y= -2 Im(b)= -2*(1/3)= -2/3

z=0. So the Bloch vector is (0, -2/3,0). 

So in all these, the only matrix with non-zero y-component is Y and W, but even then only one component. 

Wait, so according to this, Z has zero y-component, so the correct answer should not be Z. But the user says that the correct answer is that for Z, every component is non-zero. 

Is there a possibility that I misapplied the formula? Let me see the standard parametrization:

The density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2

Therefore, the diagonal entries are (1 + z)/2 and (1 - z)/2.

The off-diagonal entries are (x - i y)/2.

Wait, let me write that out.

Let me write the matrix form:

ρ = (1/2)[ I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z ]

So expanding:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z=[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Thus:

I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z = 

[[1 + z, x - iy], 

 [x + iy, 1 - z]]

Therefore dividing by 2, the density matrix is:

[ (1+z)/2       (x - iy)/2 ]

[ (x + iy)/2     (1-z)/2 ]

So equating to the given density matrix ρ = [a    b ]

                                          [b* 1-a ]

Therefore:

a = (1 + z)/2 → z=2a -1

x - iy = 2 b

x + iy = 2 b^*

Therefore, solving for x and y:

Add the two equations:

(x - iy) + (x + iy) = 2b + 2b^* → 2x = 2 Re(2b) → x = Re(2b). Wait wait:

Wait let me solve for x and y:

Let me denote 2b = (x - iy). Then,

2b* = (x + iy). 

Adding these equations:

2b + 2b^* = 2x → x = (2b + 2b*)/2 = Re(2b)

Wait, but 2b is a complex number. Let me write b = α + iβ, then 2b = 2α + 2iβ,

then x - iy = 2α + 2iβ,

so equate real and imaginary parts:

Real part: x = 2α,

Imaginary part: -y = 2β → y = -2β,

Therefore, x = 2 Re(b),

y = -2 Im(b).

So that's consistent with the previous formula. 

Thus, if the off-diagonal term b is real, then y =0. For matrix Z, b is real (1/4), so y=0. 

Therefore the y-component is indeed zero. 

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. This is conflicting. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the format of the matrices? Let me check again.

The user says:

"the format of the above matrices is such that the semicolon separates the rows."

Yes, so Z is first row [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. 

Wait, could it be that in the problem statement, the off-diagonal terms are different? For instance, if the matrix had a non-real off-diagonal entry, then the y-component would be non-zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the matrix Z? Let me check again:

"Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)"

Yes, that's row1:2/3,1/4; row2:1/4,1/3. 

Hmm. So according to my calculations, Z has y-component zero. 

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the Bloch vector components but the matrix elements? But the question specifically says Bloch vector components.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the components to be non-zero in absolute value, but in the case of y-component being zero, that's not. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the x-component? Let me check with the other parametrization.

For Z, the off-diagonal term is b
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question here about Bloch vectors and these matrices W, X, Y, Z. The correct answer is supposed to be that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that any 2x2 density matrix (which these matrices probably are, since they have trace 1?) can be represented as a Bloch vector. The Bloch vector components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ are the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz). So, to get the Bloch vector components (r_x, r_y, r_z), you can compute Tr(ρσ_x), Tr(ρσ_y), and Tr(ρσ_z), right?

Let me confirm that. The trace of ρ with each Pauli matrix gives twice the corresponding component of the Bloch vector. Wait, let's see:

If ρ = (I + r_xσ_x + r_yσ_y + r_zσ_z)/2,

then Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2)(Tr(σ_x) + r_x Tr(σ_x²) + r_y Tr(σ_y σ_x) + r_z Tr(σ_z σ_x))

But the trace of σ_x is zero, since it's a Pauli matrix. Similarly, σ_x squared is identity, so Tr(σ_x²) = 2. The cross terms like Tr(σ_y σ_x) would be zero because σ_y and σ_x anti-commute, so their product has trace zero. Same for σ_z σ_x. Therefore, Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2)(r_x * 2) = r_x. Similarly for the others. So, yes, the Bloch vector components are exactly the traces of ρ with each Pauli matrix. So, to find the Bloch vector components for Z, I need to compute Tr(Z σ_x), Tr(Z σ_y), and Tr(Z σ_z).

Let me write down matrix Z first. The user wrote it as (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). So in standard form:

Z = [2/3   1/4]
     [1/4  1/3]

First, check if it's a density matrix. The trace should be 1. Let's see: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, so trace is 1. Good. Also, it should be Hermitian. The off-diagonal elements are 1/4 and 1/4, which are real, so complex conjugate is the same. So yes, Hermitian. So that's a valid density matrix.

Now compute the traces with the Pauli matrices.

Let me recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [0 1; 1 0]

σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

σ_z = [1 0; 0 -1]

First, compute Tr(Z σ_x):

Multiply Z and σ_x, then take the trace.

Z * σ_x = [2/3   1/4] * [0 1; 1 0] = ?

Wait, actually, the trace of the product is Tr(Z σ_x). Let me compute each element.

Alternatively, since trace is cyclic, Tr(Z σ_x) = Tr(σ_x Z). Let me compute σ_x Z first:

σ_x Z = [0 1; 1 0] * [2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3] = ?

First row: 0*(2/3) + 1*(1/4) = 1/4; 0*(1/4) +1*(1/3) = 1/3

Second row: 1*(2/3) + 0*(1/4) = 2/3; 1*(1/4) + 0*(1/3) = 1/4

So σ_x Z is:

[1/4   1/3]

[2/3   1/4]

Then trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 0.5. Wait, 1/4 + 1/4 is 0.5. So Tr(Z σ_x) is 0.5?

Wait, but let me check my multiplication again. Wait, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product, right?

Wait, actually, when you multiply two matrices, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product. Let me recalculate σ_x Z:

First element (1,1) of σ_x Z: first row of σ_x times first column of Z.

σ_x first row is [0,1], Z first column is [2/3; 1/4], so 0*(2/3) +1*(1/4)=1/4. Correct.

Second element (2,2) of σ_x Z: second row of σ_x times second column of Z.

σ_x second row is [1, 0], Z's second column is [1/4;1/3]. So 1*(1/4) +0*(1/3)=1/4. So the diagonal terms are 1/4 and 1/4, so trace is 1/4 +1/4 = 0.5. That's correct. So Tr(Z σ_x)=0.5.

Now Tr(Z σ_y). Let's compute that.

σ_y is [0 -i; i 0]

Compute Tr(Z σ_y) = Tr(σ_y Z). Let's compute σ_y Z:

σ_y Z = [0 -i; i 0] * [2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3]

First row:

0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4 for the (1,1) element?

Wait, first row first column:

First row of σ_y is [0, -i] multiplied by first column of Z [2/3;1/4]

So 0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

First row second column: [0, -i] * [1/4;1/3] = 0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3) = -i/3

Second row first column: [i, 0] * [2/3;1/4] = i*(2/3) + 0*(1/4) = (2i)/3

Second row second column: [i, 0] * [1/4;1/3] = i*(1/4) +0*(1/3) = i/4

So σ_y Z is:

[ -i/4    -i/3 ]

[ 2i/3    i/4 ]

The trace is (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. Wait, that's zero? Hmm. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the diagonal elements are -i/4 and i/4. Adding them gives (-i/4 + i/4) = 0. So Trace of σ_y Z is zero. Therefore Tr(Z σ_y)=0?

Hmm, that's interesting. But let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate σ_y Z:

First element (1,1):

Row 1 of σ_y: [0, -i]

Column 1 of Z: [2/3, 1/4]^T

So 0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4. Correct.

Second diagonal element (2,2):

Row 2 of σ_y: [i, 0]

Column 2 of Z: [1/4, 1/3]^T

Wait, actually the second column is [1/4; 1/3], so:

Row 2 of σ_y is [i, 0], column 2 is [1/4;1/3], so:

i*(1/4) +0*(1/3) = i/4. Correct. So indeed, the trace is (-i/4 +i/4)=0. So Tr(Z σ_y)=0.

Hmm, that component is zero. Wait but the answer says every component of Z is non-zero. Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, perhaps the question is different? Let me check the question again.

Wait, the user says: "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." So the correct answer is that Z has all components non-zero, but according to my calculation here, the y-component is zero. That contradicts the answer?

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps the trace formula is different. Wait, perhaps I should compute Tr(ρ σ_y), but in my calculation I did Tr(σ_y Z). But trace is cyclic, so it's the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, or maybe I misread the matrix?

Wait the matrix Z is given as:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So as written, the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. So that's correct.

Wait, so Z is Hermitian, so the off-diagonal elements are real and equal, so that's fine.

Hmm, so according to my calculation, Tr(Z σ_y)=0, which would mean the y-component is zero, so that contradicts the answer. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again.

Wait, let me compute Tr(σ_y Z) step by step again.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]]

Multiplying σ_y * Z:

First element (1,1):

Row 1 of σ_y: [0, -i]

Column 1 of Z: [2/3; 1/4]

0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

First row, second column:

Row 1 of σ_y: [0, -i]

Column 2 of Z: [1/4; 1/3]

0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3) = -i/3

Second row, first column:

Row 2 of σ_y: [i, 0]

Column 1 of Z: [2/3; 1/4]

i*(2/3) +0*(1/4) = (2i)/3

Second row, second column:

Row 2 of σ_y: [i, 0]

Column 2 of Z: [1/4; 1/3]

i*(1/4) +0*(1/3) = i/4

So the product matrix is correct. The trace is indeed (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. Hmm. So that would mean the y-component is zero, which contradicts the answer's claim that every component is non-zero. That suggests either my calculation is wrong, or maybe the question has a different matrix?

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So yes, that's correct. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question wants the components of the Bloch vector, which is r_x, r_y, r_z.

Wait, but in my calculation, r_x is Tr(Z σ_x) = 0.5, r_y is Tr(Z σ_y)=0, r_z is Tr(Z σ_z). Let me compute that.

Compute Tr(Z σ_z). σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Z σ_z is:

[2/3*1 + 1/4*0, 2/3*0 +1/4*(-1)]

Wait, actually, better to compute σ_z Z or Z σ_z, but trace is same.

Let me compute Z σ_z first:

Z σ_z = [2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3] * [1 0;0 -1]

Multiplying:

First row: 2/3*1 +1/4*0 = 2/3, 2/3*0 +1/4*(-1) = -1/4

Second row: 1/4*1 + 1/3*0 = 1/4, 1/4*0 +1/3*(-1)= -1/3

So Z σ_z is:

[2/3   -1/4]

[1/4   -1/3]

Trace is 2/3 + (-1/3) = 1/3. So Tr(Z σ_z)=1/3. Therefore r_z = 1/3.

Wait, but then the components:

r_x = 0.5, r_y = 0, r_z = 1/3.

But that would mean the y-component is zero. So then the correct answer should not be Z, but maybe the question is incorrect?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up with the trace for σ_y.

Alternatively, maybe the question actually meant that Z is the correct answer because it's the only one with all components non-zero, but according to my calculations here, Z has a zero component. So something's wrong here.

Wait, let me check the other matrices too, maybe the user wants to compare and see which one has all components non-zero. Let me quickly check another matrix, maybe W.

Take W first: W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So this is Hermitian because the off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates. Let's compute its Bloch vector components.

Compute Tr(W σ_x):

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

First compute W σ_x:

[1/2   i/4; -i/4   1/2] * [0 1;1 0]

First row first column: 1/2*0 +i/4*1 = i/4

First row second column: 1/2*1 + i/4*0 = 1/2

Second row first column: -i/4*0 +1/2*1 = 1/2

Second row second column: -i/4*1 +1/2*0 = -i/4

So W σ_x is:

[ i/4    1/2 ]

[1/2    -i/4 ]

Trace is i/4 + (-i/4) = 0. So Tr(W σ_x)=0. So r_x=0. Hmm.

Tr(W σ_y):

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

So compute W σ_y:

[1/2  i/4; -i/4 1/2] * [0 -i; i 0]

First row first column: 1/2*0 +i/4*i = i/4 * i = -1/4 (since i^2 = -1)

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First row first column: (1/2)(0) + (i/4)(i) = (i^2)/4 = (-1)/4

First row second column: (1/2)(-i) + (i/4)(0) = -i/2

Second row first column: (-i/4)(0) + (1/2)(i) = (i)/2

Second row second column: (-i/4)(-i) + (1/2)(0) = (i^2)/4 = -1/4

Thus, W σ_y is:

[ -1/4    -i/2 ]

[  i/2    -1/4 ]

Trace is -1/4 + (-1/4) = -1/2. So Tr(W σ_y) = -1/2? Wait, but trace is the sum of diagonal elements. Wait, the diagonal elements are -1/4 and -1/4, so total -1/2. So r_y = -1/2?

Wait, but the trace of W σ_y is -1/2. Hmm. So the y-component is -1/2, but the x-component was 0. Then z-component?

Compute Tr(W σ_z):

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

W σ_z is:

[1/2*1 + i/4*0, 1/2*0 +i/4*(-1) ]

Wait, actually, compute element-wise:

First row first column: 1/2 *1 =1/2

First row second column: (i/4)*(-1) since σ_z second element is -1 on diagonal.

Wait, actually, better to do matrix multiplication:

W σ_z = [1/2  i/4; -i/4  1/2] * [1 0;0 -1]

First row: 1/2*1 + (i/4)*0 = 1/2; 1/2*0 + (i/4)*(-1) = -i/4

Second row: -i/4*1 +1/2*0 = -i/4; -i/4*0 +1/2*(-1) = -1/2

Thus, W σ_z is:

[1/2   -i/4]

[-i/4  -1/2]

Trace: 1/2 + (-1/2)=0. So Tr(W σ_z)=0. Therefore, the Bloch vector for W has components r_x=0, r_y=-1/2, r_z=0. So only y-component is non-zero. So if the question is about which matrix has all components non-zero, W isn't it.

Next, let's check matrix X: (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Let's see.

X has trace 1/3 +2/3=1, so valid. Hermitian since off-diagonal are real and equal. Now compute Bloch vector components.

First, Tr(X σ_x). σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Compute X σ_x:

[1/3  1; 1 2/3] * [0 1;1 0]

First row first column: 1/3*0 +1*1=1

First row second column: 1/3*1 +1*0=1/3

Second row first column:1*0 +2/3*1=2/3

Second row second column:1*1 +2/3*0=1

So X σ_x is:

[1    1/3]

[2/3  1 ]

Trace: 1 +1=2. So Tr(X σ_x)=2? Wait, but Bloch vector components are the traces. Wait, but in the formula, ρ=(I + r·σ)/2, so the trace with σ_x is r_x. Wait, but if Tr(X σ_x)=2, then r_x would be 2?

Wait, hold on. Wait, the formula is:

ρ=(I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

Therefore, taking trace with σ_x:

Tr(ρ σ_x)= (1/2)[Tr(σ_x) + r_x Tr(σ_x²) + ... ]

But σ_x has trace zero, and σ_x² is identity, so Tr(σ_x²)=2. So Tr(ρ σ_x)= (1/2)(r_x *2) = r_x.

Therefore, the trace over ρ σ_x is r_x. So if Tr(X σ_x)=2, then r_x=2? But that can't be possible, since the maximum value for the Bloch vector components is 1 (for pure states), or less for mixed states.

Wait, so something's wrong here. Because Tr(X σ_x) is 2? Let me recalculate.

Wait, when I computed X σ_x, the product matrix was:

[1, 1/3;

2/3, 1]

So trace is 1+1=2. But then the trace of X σ_x is 2. But since σ_x has trace zero, and X is a density matrix, how can the trace be 2? That would imply that r_x=2, which exceeds the maximum possible value. Therefore, perhaps the mistake is here?

Wait, let me recompute the product X σ_x. Maybe I did it wrong.

Wait, matrix multiplication is row times column.

First row of X is [1/3, 1], first column of σ_x is [0;1].

So first element (1,1): (1/3)(0) + (1)(1) =1

First row, second column of product: first row of X [1/3,1] times second column of σ_x [1;0]

= (1/3)(1) + (1)(0) =1/3

Second row first column: second row of X [1, 2/3] times first column of σ_x [0;1]

=1*0 + (2/3)*1=2/3

Second row second column: second row of X [1,2/3] times second column of σ_x [1;0]

=1*1 + (2/3)*0=1

So the product is indeed [1, 1/3; 2/3,1], so trace is 2. But then r_x=2, which is impossible for a density matrix. Wait, this can't be right. The trace of X is 1, but the trace of X times σ_x can be more? Wait, actually, the trace of X σ_x can be any value, but the components of the Bloch vector can't exceed 1 in magnitude for pure states, but for mixed states, they can have individual components greater?

Wait, no, actually the components of the Bloch vector for a density matrix must satisfy r·r ≤1, so each component can be up to 1, but in magnitude. So getting 2 would violate that. Therefore, there must be an error here.

Wait, let me check again. Wait, the formula says ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Then, Tr(ρ) = (Tr(I) + Tr(r·σ))/2. Since Tr(r·σ) is zero, because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So Tr(ρ)=1, which is okay.

But then if r_x = Tr(ρ σ_x) = 2, that would mean r_x=2. So then, the expression for ρ would be (I +2 σ_x + ... )/2. Let's see, check if that would produce the X matrix.

Let me compute (I +2 σ_x)/2:

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], 2 σ_x is [[0,2],[2,0]]. So adding those gives [[1,2],[2,1]]. Dividing by 2 gives [[1/2,1],[1,1/2]]. But matrix X is [1/3,1;1,2/3]. So it's different. Therefore, the calculation must be wrong. Wait, so where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait a second! I think I confused Tr(X σ_x) with something else. Wait, actually, the formula is that the trace of ρ σ_x is equal to r_x, but when you compute the trace of the product of two matrices, it's not necessarily that. Wait, let me double-check the formula.

Let me rederive:

Suppose ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Then, Tr(ρ σ_x) = Tr( (I/2 + (r_x σ_x)/2 + ... ) σ_x )

= (1/2)Tr(I σ_x) + (r_x /2) Tr(σ_x²) + (r_y /2) Tr(σ_y σ_x) + (r_z /2) Tr(σ_z σ_x)

As before. The first term, Tr(I σ_x)= Tr(σ_x)=0. The second term, Tr(σ_x^2)=2. The cross terms are zero because σ_x σ_y anticommute etc. So the result is (r_x /2)(2) = r_x. So Tr(ρ σ_x)=r_x. Therefore, in the case of matrix X, Tr(X σ_x)=2, which would imply r_x=2, but that's impossible because the maximum possible value of the Bloch vector components is 1 (for pure states). Therefore, this suggests an error in calculation.

Wait, but let's recompute the trace again. Tr(X σ_x). The trace of the product matrix [1, 1/3; 2/3, 1] is 1 +1=2. So this is correct. Hmm. Therefore, perhaps matrix X is not a valid density matrix?

Wait, but the trace of X is 1/3 + 2/3 =1, which is okay. Hermitian? The off-diagonal elements are 1 and 1, so yes, Hermitian. So it's a valid density matrix, but its Bloch vector x-component is 2, which is impossible because the maximum is 1. Therefore, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, maybe the formula is different? Maybe the trace is taken over the product in the other order. Wait, trace is cyclic, so Tr(A B)=Tr(B A). So it's the same. Wait, but maybe the question is written incorrectly? Let me see the original problem again.

Original matrices:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Hmm, so matrix X has entries [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3]. So the off-diagonal terms are 1. The trace is 1. But the trace with σ_x is 2, which gives r_x=2. Since the maximum for a Bloch vector component is 1 for pure states, but mixed states can have components greater than 1? Wait, no. For a mixed state, the Bloch vector components can go beyond 1 in individual components but only if they satisfy the condition that the squared components sum to less than or equal to 1? Or is that not the case?

Wait, actually, for any density matrix, the Bloch vector r must satisfy ||r|| ≤1. Because,

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 must be a valid density matrix, which requires that the eigenvalues are between 0 and 1. The eigenvalues of ρ are 1/2 ± (1/2)√(r_x² + r_y² + r_z²). To ensure the eigenvalues are non-negative, we require that √(r_x² + r_y² + r_z²) ≤1. So the norm squared is r_x² + r_y² + r_z² ≤1.

Therefore, individual components can be larger than 1 as long as their squares sum to less than or equal to 1. Wait, but if r_x=2, then even if other components are zero, the norm squared would be 4, which violates the condition. Therefore, such a density matrix is not valid. But matrix X is trace one, Hermitian, but gives a Bloch vector with magnitude squared of 4 (if only r_x is 2), which is impossible. Therefore, the matrix X must be invalid? But that contradicts the initial calculation that it is a valid density matrix.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Tr(X σ_x). Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, matrix X:

[1/3   1     ]

[1     2/3 ]

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

X σ_x:

First row first column: 1/3 *0 +1*1 =1

First row second column:1/3 *1 +1 *0=1/3

Second row first column:1*0 +2/3 *1=2/3

Second row second column:1*1 +2/3 *0=1

So trace is 1+1=2. So that's correct. Therefore, the trace is indeed 2, which would make r_x=2. But then the norm squared is 4, which is invalid. Therefore, the matrix X is not valid? But it has trace 1 and is Hermitian. Wait, perhaps there is a constraint I'm missing?

Wait, actually, no. The condition for a valid density matrix is that it's Hermitian, has trace 1, and positive semi-definite. So maybe matrix X is not positive semi-definite?

Let me check that. Let's compute the eigenvalues of X. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] are [ (a+d ± sqrt((a-d)^2 +4bc))/2 ]

For X, a=1/3, d=2/3, so a+d=1, and (a-d)= -1/3. Then sqrt( ( (-1/3)^2 +4*1*1 ) ) = sqrt(1/9 +4)= sqrt(37/9)=sqrt(37)/3 ≈6.08/3≈2.026.

Therefore eigenvalues are (1 ± 2.026)/2. So (1+2.026)/2≈1.513 and (1-2.026)/2≈-0.513. Negative eigenvalue. Therefore, X is not positive semi-definite. Hence, it's not a valid density matrix. So the problem statement must have an error here. Because matrix X is not a valid density matrix, but it's presented as one. Hmm.

So that complicates things. Since the question is about which matrix has all components non-zero, perhaps the question's matrix Z is the correct one. Let's get back to Z.

Earlier calculation for Z gave:

r_x = 0.5, r_y =0, r_z=1/3. Thus the y-component is zero. But the answer says every component is non-zero. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the trace for σ_y?

Wait, let me recompute Tr(Z σ_y). Let me compute it as Tr(Z σ_y) instead of Tr(σ_y Z). Let's see.

Z is [2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3]

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Multiplying Z and σ_y:

Z σ_y = [2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3] * [0 -i; i 0]

First row first column: 2/3 *0 +1/4 *i = i/4

First row second column:2/3*(-i) +1/4*0 = -2i/3

Second row first column:1/4*0 +1/3*i = i/3

Second row second column:1/4*(-i) +1/3*0 = -i/4

So Z σ_y is:

[ i/4   -2i/3 ]

[ i/3    -i/4 ]

Then the trace is i/4 + (-i/4) =0. So same result. Therefore, the trace is zero. So the y-component is zero.

Wait, then how is the answer that all components of Z's Bloch vector are non-zero? Unless I made a mistake in the question.

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The user says:

"Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. ?"

Wait, so perhaps the question is asking to pick the correct statement among options, and the correct answer is the one that says "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero". But according to my calculations, that's false, because r_y is zero. Hmm. Is there a chance that I miscalculated?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the components of the vector in terms of the real and imaginary parts? But no, the Bloch vector is defined with real components.

Alternatively, maybe the Z matrix is written differently. Wait, the user wrote Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). Let me verify that.

Yes, that's 2/3 and 1/4 in first row, then 1/4 and 1/3 in second. So that's correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the σ_y trace. Wait, let me think differently. Let me write the general formula for the Bloch vector components.

Given a density matrix ρ = [[a, b],[c, d]], then the Bloch vector components are:

r_x = 2 Re(b)

Wait, hold on, maybe there's a different way to compute the Bloch vector components directly from the matrix entries?

Yes! Alternatively, the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) can be computed as:

r_x = 2*(the real part of the off-diagonal element)

Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, let's represent the density matrix as:

ρ = [ ρ_11        ρ_12      ]

     [ ρ_21        ρ_22     ]

Then, since it's Hermitian, ρ_21 = ρ_12^*. So, let me write ρ_12 = x + iy.

Then, the off-diagonal terms can be written as:

ρ_12 = (r_x + i r_y)/2,

Wait, actually, let me recall that the general form is:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

We can write this as:

[ (1 + r_z)/2         (r_x - i r_y)/2   ]

[ (r_x + i r_y)/2     (1 - r_z)/2        ]

Therefore, the diagonal terms:

ρ_11 = (1 + r_z)/2,

ρ_22 = (1 - r_z)/2,

The off-diagonal element (ρ_12) is (r_x -i r_y)/2,

and its conjugate ρ_21 = (r_x +i r_y)/2.

Therefore:

r_x = 2 Re(ρ_12),

r_y = -2 Im(ρ_12),

r_z = 2 ρ_11 -1.

So maybe using this method will be easier.

Let me apply this to Z.

Matrix Z is:

[ 2/3      1/4 ]

[1/4      1/3 ]

Therefore, ρ_11 =2/3, so r_z =2*(2/3) -1 =4/3 -1=1/3. That matches the previous result.

ρ_12 =1/4 (which is real, so imaginary part is zero). Therefore,

r_x = 2 Re(1/4)= 2*(1/4)=1/2,

r_y = -2 Im(1/4)=0,

Hence, indeed, r_x=1/2, r_y=0, r_z=1/3. So the y-component is zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector of Z has a zero component. So the answer saying "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." is incorrect?

Hmm, this is perplexing. Unless there's a mistake in the problem's matrices.

Wait, let me check matrix Y. Perhaps the correct matrix is Y?

Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

So using the formula:

ρ_11=1/2, so r_z= 2*(1/2) -1=0.

ρ_12= i/3. So Re(rho_12)=0, Im(rho_12)=1/3. So:

r_x=2*0=0,

r_y= -2*(1/3)= -2/3,

r_z=0.

Thus, the components are (0, -2/3, 0). Only y-component non-zero.

Hmm. So Y also has only one component.

Matrix W, as
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about determining why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of matrix Z is nonzero. The options probably include this statement, and we need to verify why Z specifically has all components of its Bloch vector non-zero while maybe others don't. 

First, I need to recall what a Bloch vector is. The Bloch vector is a way to represent a single-qubit quantum state (or a density matrix) using three real numbers corresponding to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z). The Bloch vector components are given by (Tr(ρX), Tr(ρY), Tr(ρZ)), where ρ is the density matrix. 

Given that each matrix here is a 2x2 matrix, they might represent density matrices. The question is asking why Z is the one where all components of its Bloch vector are non-zero. So I need to calculate the Bloch vector for each matrix W, X, Y, Z and see which one has all components non-zero. 

Let me start by recalling the Pauli matrices:

Pauli X: 
[0 1]
[1 0]

Pauli Y:
[0  -i]
[i  0]

Pauli Z:
[1   0]
[0  -1]

The identity matrix I:
[1 0]
[0 1]

For any 2x2 matrix, we can express it in terms of the Pauli matrices and the identity. The general form is:

ρ = (I + v_x X + v_y Y + v_z Z)/2

Therefore, the Bloch vector components v_x, v_y, v_z are given by Tr(ρX), Tr(ρY), Tr(ρZ) multiplied by 2? Wait, let me confirm. 

Actually, the formula is that if ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then the Bloch vector components r_x, r_y, r_z are exactly Tr(ρX), Tr(ρY), Tr(ρZ). Wait, let me check this again.

Suppose ρ is written as (I + v·σ)/2, where v is the Bloch vector. Then Tr(ρ X) would be Tr( (I + v·σ)/2 * X ). Since Tr(I X) = Tr(X) = 0, and Tr(σ_i σ_j) = 2 δ_{ij}. So Tr( (v·σ)/2 * X ) = (v_x * Tr(X X) + v_y Tr(Y X) + v_z Tr(Z X))/2. But since Tr(XY)=Tr(YX)=0, Tr(XZ)=Tr(ZX)=0, and Tr(XX)=Tr(YY)=Tr(ZZ)=2. Therefore, Tr(ρ X) = (v_x * 2)/2 = v_x. Similarly for Y and Z. Therefore the Bloch vector components are exactly Tr(ρX), Tr(ρY), Tr(ρZ). Therefore, to get each component, just compute the trace of the matrix multiplied by X, Y, Z respectively.

Therefore, for each given matrix (W, X, Y, Z), we can compute Tr(matrix * X), Tr(matrix * Y), Tr(matrix * Z). Then check which of them have all three traces non-zero. The question is why Z is the correct answer, so probably Z has all three non-zero while the others have at least one zero.

Let me start with matrix W. 

Matrix W is given as (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). Let me write it out:

W = [1/2   i/4]
     [-i/4  1/2 ]

First, compute the trace of W. The trace is (1/2 + 1/2) = 1, so it's a valid density matrix. Now compute the components.

Compute Tr(W * X):

First, compute W * X. Let me write X as the Pauli X matrix:

X = [0 1]
     [1 0]

Multiplying W and X:

First row of W: [1/2, i/4] times first column of X: [0,1]^T: (1/2)*0 + (i/4)*1 = i/4

First row of W times second column of X: [0,1] second element? Wait, maybe I should think of matrix multiplication as W multiplied by X.

Wait, actually, the trace of A*B is the sum over i,j of A_ij B_ji. Alternatively, it's equal to the trace of B*A. Let me compute Tr(W X). Since trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, Tr(W X) = Tr( X W ). But maybe computing directly is easier here.

Alternatively, compute each element of W*X:

First row first column: (1/2)(0) + (i/4)(1) = i/4

First row second column: (1/2)(1) + (i/4)(0) = 1/2

Second row first column: (-i/4)(0) + (1/2)(1) = 1/2

Second row second column: (-i/4)(1) + (1/2)(0) = -i/4

Thus, W*X is:

[i/4   1/2]
[1/2  -i/4]

Taking the trace (diagonal elements): i/4 + (-i/4) = 0. So Tr(W X) = 0. Therefore the x-component is 0.

Similarly, compute Tr(W Y). Let's compute Y, which is Pauli Y:

Y = [0   -i]
     [i   0 ]

So W*Y:

First row first column: (1/2)(0) + (i/4)(i) = (i/4)(i) = (i^2)/4 = -1/4

First row second column: (1/2)(-i) + (i/4)(0) = - (i/2)

Second row first column: (-i/4)(0) + (1/2)(i) = (i/2)

Second row second column: (-i/4)(-i) + (1/2)(0) = (i^2)/4 = -1/4

So W*Y:

[-1/4    -i/2]
[ i/2    -1/4 ]

Trace is (-1/4) + (-1/4) = -1/2. So Tr(W Y) = -1/2. 

Then Tr(W Z). Pauli Z is diag(1,-1). So multiplying W by Z:

First row of W: [1/2, i/4] multiplied by Z's columns:

First column: 1/2 *1 + i/4 *0 = 1/2

Second column: 1/2 *0 + i/4*(-1) = -i/4

Second row of W: [-i/4, 1/2] multiplied by Z's columns:

First column: -i/4 *1 +1/2*0 = -i/4

Second column: -i/4*0 +1/2*(-1) = -1/2

So W*Z:

[1/2     -i/4]
[-i/4    -1/2]

Trace is 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0. So Tr(W Z) =0. 

Therefore, the Bloch vector for W is (0, -1/2, 0). So two components are zero (x and z). So W can't be the correct answer.

Now let's do matrix X. Given:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So written as:

X = [1/3  1   ]
    [1    2/3 ]

First check trace: 1/3 + 2/3 =1, so valid density matrix.

Compute Tr(X * X). Wait no, first components:

First component: Tr(X multiplied by Pauli X). Let me do that.

First, X * Pauli X (Pauli X is [0,1;1,0]):

Compute X * Pauli X:

First row first column: (1/3)(0) + (1)(1) =1

First row second column: (1/3)(1) + (1)(0)= 1/3

Second row first column: (1)(0) + (2/3)(1) =2/3

Second row second column: (1)(1) + (2/3)(0)=1

Therefore, X*X matrix:

[1      1/3]
[2/3    1 ]

Trace is 1 +1 =2. So Tr(X X) = 2. But the x-component of Bloch vector is Tr(X multiplied by Pauli X). Since trace is 2, so v_x =2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, let's correct that. Wait, the trace of X * Pauli X is:

Wait, actually, in the calculation above, we computed X multiplied by Pauli X, but the trace is 1 +1=2, so Tr(X * X) = 2. Therefore, the x-component is 2/(2)? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula is the component is Tr(ρ * σ_i), right? So for the x-component, it's Tr(X * Pauli X). The Pauli X has a trace of 0, but when multiplied by X, the trace can be non-zero.

Wait in our previous calculation, when we did X multiplied by Pauli X, we got the matrix:

[1, 1/3]

[2/3, 1]

Trace is 2, so Tr(X * X) is 2, so the x-component is 2. Wait but Bloch vector components are defined as Tr(ρ σ_i). Wait, but in the decomposition, ρ = (I + v·σ)/2, so indeed, Tr(ρ σ_i) = v_i. Therefore, the x-component here is Tr(X * Pauli X) = 2. Wait but that seems too large because the maximum value of Bloch components can be 1.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so the maximum value for the components would be 1. But in our calculation here, Trace(X * Pauli X)=2. That can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate the multiplication. Let me recompute X * Pauli X.

Wait, X is [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3]

Pauli X is [0,1;1,0]

Multiplying X * Pauli X:

First row first column: (1/3)(0) + (1)(1) =1

First row second column: (1/3)(1) + (1)(0)= 1/3

Second row first column: (1)(0) + (2/3)(1) = 2/3

Second row second column: (1)(1) + (2/3)(0) =1

Yes, that's correct, so the trace is indeed 2. But that would mean that Tr(X * Pauli X)=2, but the maximum possible value for a trace of X*PauliX would be for a pure state with eigenvalues 1 and 0. Then, for Pauli X being a Hermitian matrix with trace 0, the maximum possible Trace(ρ σ_x) would be 1. So getting 2 is impossible, so I must have messed up something here.

Wait a second. Wait, perhaps I confused the order of multiplication? Because Tr(A B) = Tr(B A), so perhaps I should compute Pauli X multiplied by X instead?

Let me try that. Compute Pauli X * X:

Pauli X is [0,1;1,0], multiplied by X:

First row first column: 0*(1/3) +1*1 =1

First row second column: 0*1 +1*(2/3) =2/3

Second row first column:1*(1/3) +0*1 =1/3

Second row second column:1*1 +0*(2/3)=1

So Pauli X * X is:

[1, 2/3]

[1/3,1]

Which has trace 1 +1 =2 as well. The trace is the same, so it doesn't matter. Therefore, the trace is indeed 2, which is impossible. Hmm, that can't be right, so perhaps the problem is that matrix X is not a valid density matrix?

Wait, let's check the trace again. The trace is 1/3 + 2/3 =1, so that's okay. But the eigenvalues must be non-negative. Let's check the eigenvalues of X.

The matrix X is:

[1/3, 1]

[1, 2/3]

To find eigenvalues, we can compute the characteristic equation:

det(X - λ I) = (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = 0

Expanding:

( (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3 +2/3)λ + λ^2 ) -1 = (2/9 - λ + λ^2) -1 = λ^2 - λ + (2/9 -1) = λ^2 - λ - 7/9 =0

Solutions are λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] /2 = [1 ± sqrt(37/9)] /2 = [1 ± (sqrt(37)/3)] /2

Compute sqrt(37) ≈6.08, so sqrt(37)/3≈2.027. So eigenvalues would be [1 + 2.027]/2 ≈ 1.513 and [1 -2.027]/2≈-0.513. Wait, a negative eigenvalue? That's impossible for a density matrix. 

Wait, so the matrix X has a negative eigenvalue, so it's not a valid density matrix! That must be a problem. Wait, but the problem statement presented matrices W, X, Y, Z. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the matrices? Let me check again.

The problem says:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Yes, so that would mean entries:

First row: 1/3 and 1,

Second row:1 and 2/3. 

Hmm, that's indeed problematic because the eigenvalues are not both non-negative. Therefore, this might be an error in the problem statement, but assuming that the problem is correct, perhaps I misinterpreted the format?

Wait the user mentioned "the format of the above matrices is such that the semicolon separates the rows". So perhaps the user input was:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3) meaning rows separated by semicolons, so first row is [1/3, 1], second row [1, 2/3]. So that's what I considered. 

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo and the entries are different? But according to the problem as stated, X has those entries. So perhaps the problem is correct and I need to proceed, but in that case, the matrix X is not a valid density matrix, so maybe the question is not about density matrices but just about Bloch vectors for any Hermitian matrices? Wait, but Bloch vectors are usually for density matrices. 

Alternatively, maybe the matrices are scaled differently? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem? Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the trace of X multiplied by Pauli X? Wait, if the trace is 2, which is greater than 1, but since the Pauli matrices have operator norms of 1, then the component should be between -1 and 1, so getting 2 is impossible, which suggests that the matrix isn't a valid density matrix. Therefore, perhaps X is actually an invalid matrix, so we can disregard it. 

The problem says "based on these matrices", so perhaps they want us to still compute the components, even if it's not a valid density matrix? Maybe. Anyway, proceeding.

So the x-component Tr(X * Pauli X)=2, but that's impossible. Hmm, maybe I need to check the multiplication again. Wait, if the trace is 2, maybe the question is not about the components of the Bloch vector, but something else? Wait no.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the matrix. Alternatively, maybe the semicolon is separating columns? Wait, the user says "the semicolon separates the rows", so first row first entry, second entry, then semicolon, then second row. So my interpretation was correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are fractions. Let me check again:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). The off-diagonal entries are 1, which when multiplied by Pauli X gives large terms. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a missing denominator? Maybe the entries are (1/3, 1/3; 1/3, 2/3). But as stated, it's 1. Maybe a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/1? Not sure. Since the problem is given as such, perhaps we need to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the components are computed without considering that the trace must be normalized? Let me see. Let's proceed with calculations for X.

Even if it's invalid, let's see:

The x-component is Tr(X * Pauli X)=2, y-component: Tr(X * Pauli Y).

Compute that now. Let's compute X * Pauli Y.

Pauli Y is [0, -i; i, 0].

Multiply X * Pauli Y:

First row first column: (1/3)(0) + (1)(i) = i

First row second column: (1/3)(-i) + (1)(0) = -i/3

Second row first column: (1)(0) + (2/3)(i) = (2i)/3

Second row second column: (1)(-i) + (2/3)(0) = -i

So the matrix is:

[ i        -i/3 ]

[ 2i/3     -i ]

Taking the trace: i + (-i) = 0. So Tr(X Y) = 0.

Now Tr(X * Pauli Z). Pauli Z is diag(1, -1).

X is [1/3,1;1,2/3]

Multiply by Pauli Z:

First row first column:1/3 *1 +1*0=1/3

First row second column:1/3*0 +1*(-1)= -1

Second row first column:1*1 +2/3*0=1

Second row second column:1*0 +2/3*(-1)= -2/3

Thus the matrix X * Z is:

[1/3   -1   ]

[1     -2/3 ]

Trace:1/3 + (-2/3)= -1/3. 

Thus the Bloch vector components for X would be (2, 0, -1/3). However, since the trace of the matrix is 1, but the x-component is 2, which is outside the valid range, so this is impossible. Therefore, maybe the problem has an error here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, let me check the multiplication again.

Wait, when computing Tr(X*Pauli_Z):

The trace is (1/3)(1) + (2/3)(-1) ?

Wait, no. Wait the Pauli Z matrix is diagonal, so multiplying X with Pauli Z would be element-wise multiplication on the rows?

Wait, actually, to compute X * Pauli Z, since Pauli Z is diagonal, it's equivalent to multiplying the rows of X by the corresponding diagonal elements. Wait, actually, matrix multiplication is row times column. 

Let me recalculate:

First row of X: [1/3,1] multiplied by first column of Z (which is [1;0]) gives 1/3*1 +1*0=1/3

First row of X multiplied by second column of Z (which is [0; -1]) gives 1/3*0 +1*(-1)= -1

Second row of X: [1,2/3] multiplied by first column of Z (1,0): 1*1 + (2/3)*0 =1

Second row of X multiplied by second column of Z (0, -1):1*0 + (2/3)*(-1)= -2/3

Thus the resulting matrix is indeed as before, so trace is 1/3 -2/3 = -1/3. So that's correct.

Therefore, the components would be (2,0,-1/3). But since the trace of the density matrix is 1, but the x-component is 2, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a problem here. Since the problem is given, maybe the question is about the components regardless of the density matrix validity? Or maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix X is actually (1/3, 1/3;1/3, 2/3) with the semicolon separating entries? Wait, maybe the user intended different entries? Let me check the problem again.

The user wrote:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

So the entries are first row:1/3, 1; second row:1, 2/3. So I think that's correct. Maybe the question is designed to have such a matrix, and the answer is about the Bloch vector's components regardless of it being a valid density matrix. The problem says "based on these matrices", so maybe they just want us to compute the components even if the matrix isn't physical. In that case, proceeding.

Now, moving on to matrix Y.

Matrix Y is given as (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). So:

Y = [1/2    i/3]
     [-i/3   1/2 ]

First, check if it's a valid density matrix. Trace is 1/2 +1/2=1. To check if it's Hermitian, the (1,2) element is i/3, so the (2,1) should be the conjugate, which is -i/3, which matches. So it's Hermitian. The eigenvalues?

Let me compute eigenvalues quickly. The characteristic equation is (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/3)(-i/3) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - ( (i)^2 )/(9) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (-1)/9 = (1/2 - λ)^2 + 1/9. 

Set to zero: (1/2 - λ)^2 = -1/9. But squares of real numbers can't be negative. Wait, so eigenvalues are complex? That can't be for a Hermitian matrix. Wait, hold on, the determinant is (1/2)^2 - (-i/3)(i/3)= 1/4 - (i^2)/9 = 1/4 - (-1)/9 =1/4 +1/9 = (9 +4)/36 =13/36.

Trace is 1, so eigenvalues satisfy λ1 + λ2 =1 and λ1 λ2 =13/36. So the quadratic equation is λ^2 - λ +13/36=0.

Discriminant:1 -4*(13/36)= 1 -52/36= (36-52)/36= -16/36= -4/9 <0. Therefore, complex eigenvalues. But Hermitian matrices must have real eigenvalues. So this matrix is not Hermitian? Wait, but it's Hermitian because the off-diagonal elements are conjugate. Wait, (i/3)^* is -i/3, and the (2,1) entry is indeed -i/3, so it is Hermitian. So why complex eigenvalues?

Wait, let me recalculate the determinant.

Determinant is (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3)= 1/4 - (i^2)/9 =1/4 - (-1)/9=1/4 +1/9= (9 +4)/36=13/36. Correct.

Trace is 1, so quadratic equation: λ² - λ +13/36=0. The discriminant is 1 -4*(13/36)= 1 -52/36=(36/36 -52/36)= -16/36 = -4/9 <0. So complex eigenvalues? That can't be for a Hermitian matrix. Wait, that must mean that I made an error.

Wait, wait, Hermitian matrices must have real eigenvalues. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation. Let me check determinant again. The determinant is (1/2)^2 - (i/3)(-i/3) =1/4 - (i * -i)/9 = 1/4 - (i²)/9. Since i² is -1, so it's 1/4 - (-1)/9=1/4 + 1/9=13/36, correct. The trace is 1.

Wait, but if the eigenvalues are complex, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me see:

Let me compute the eigenvalues numerically. Suppose the eigenvalues are complex, but Hermitian matrices can't have complex eigenvalues. So this must mean there is a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the matrix isn't Hermitian? The (1,2) entry is i/3, so the (2,1) entry should be the conjugate, which is -i/3. Which matches. So it is Hermitian. Hmm. 

Wait, let me re-express the quadratic equation:

λ² - λ +13/36 =0. So discriminant D=1 - 4*(13/36)=1 -52/36= (36 -52)/36= -16/36= -4/9. 

So the roots are [1 ± sqrt(-4/9)] /2 = [1 ± (2i/3)] /2 = 1/2 ± i/3. 

These are complex conjugates, so even though complex, for a Hermitian matrix, eigenvalues must be real. Wait, this is impossible. Therefore, the matrix must not be Hermitian? Wait, but it is Hermitian. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake here. 

Wait, hold on. The off-diagonal terms are (i/3) and (-i/3), so the matrix is Hermitian. But Hermitian matrices must have real eigenvalues. How can this be?

Wait, let me take specific values. Suppose the matrix is:

[ a         b ]
[ b*       c ]

Then the eigenvalues are [ (a + c) ± sqrt( (a - c)^2 + 4 |b|^2 ) ] / 2

Wait, so in our case a =c=1/2, so the difference (a -c)=0, so sqrt(0 +4 |b|^2 ) = 2|b|. 

Here, b is i/3, so |b|=1/3, so sqrt term is 2*(1/3)=2/3. 

Thus eigenvalues would be [ (1/2+1/2) ±2/3 ] /2 = [1 ±2/3]/2 = (5/3)/2=5/6 and (1/3)/2=1/6. Wait, hold on, wait that contradicts the previous calculation. Let me do it again:

Wait, the eigenvalues are [ (a + c) ± sqrt( (a - c)^2 +4 |b|^2 ) ] /2

Here, a = c =1/2, so (a + c)=1, (a -c)=0. Thus sqrt(0 +4*(1/3)^2) = sqrt(4*(1/9))= 2/3. 

Therefore eigenvalues are:

[1 ± 2/3]/2. 

So:

First eigenvalue: (1 + 2/3)/2 = (5/3)/2 =5/6 ≈0.833

Second eigenvalue: (1 -2/3)/2 = (1/3)/2=1/6≈0.166. Both positive. So the eigenvalues are real and positive. Wait, so why did I get complex eigenvalues before?

Ah! I see, my mistake was in the quadratic equation. The determinant is 13/36, and the trace is 1, so the quadratic equation is indeed λ² - λ +13/36=0. But 13/36 is approximately 0.361. Let me compute this equation:

λ² - λ +0.361 =0.

Compute discriminant: 1 -4*0.361=1 -1.444≈-0.444. Wait but according to the previous calculation using Hermitian formula, the eigenvalues are real. There is inconsistency here. 

Wait, let me recalculate the determinant again properly.

Given matrix Y:

[1/2   i/3]

[-i/3 1/2]

The determinant is (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) =1/4 - (i^2)/9. 

Since i² = -1, so this becomes 1/4 - (-1)/9 =1/4 +1/9= (9 +4)/36=13/36. Correct.

Trace is 1/2 +1/2=1. 

Therefore, eigenvalues via the quadratic formula:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 -4*(13/36))]/2

Compute sqrt(1 -52/36)= sqrt(-16/36)=sqrt(-4/9)=2i/3. So eigenvalues are [1 ± 2i/3]/2, which are complex. But this contradicts the Hermitian matrix's property of having real eigenvalues.

Wait a minute, this must be my mistake. Wait, Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, so there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in matrix construction.

Wait, if Y is supposed to be Hermitian, then the (2,1) entry must be the conjugate of the (1,2) entry. The (1,2) entry is i/3, so conjugate is -i/3, which is exactly the (2,1) entry. Therefore, it is Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues must be real. 

Wait, let me compute using the trace and determinant again, but using the Hermitian formula. The off-diagonal entries are b =i/3. The formula for eigenvalues when the matrix is symmetric (in real case) is [ (a + c) ± sqrt( (a - c)^2 +4b² ) ] /2. 

But here, b is complex. Wait, in the case of complex off-diagonal terms, the formula is different?

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in applying the Hermitian formula. Let me think again.

The Hermitian matrix Y has eigenvalues real. Let me compute them numerically.

Let me write the matrix as:

[ 0.5      0.0 +0.333i ]

[0.0 -0.333i      0.5 ]

To find eigenvalues, suppose λ is an eigenvalue, so:

det(Y - λ I)=0.

The matrix Y - λ I is:

[0.5 - λ   i/3     ]

[-i/3     0.5 - λ ]

The determinant is (0.5 - λ)^2 - (-i/3)(i/3) = (0.5 - λ)^2 - (i²)/9 = (0.5 - λ)^2 - (-1)/9 = (0.5 - λ)^2 +1/9.

Set to zero:

(0.5 - λ)^2 = -1/9.

Taking square roots:

0.5 - λ = ±i/3,

Thus,

λ =0.5 ∓ i/3.

So eigenvalues are complex, which contradicts the fact that Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. There's a paradox here. 

This suggests that the matrix is not Hermitian? But it is. Wait, unless I made an error in defining Hermitian matrices with complex entries. Wait, Hermitian matrices must satisfy Y = Y†, which it does. So why the eigenvalues are complex? 

Ah! Wait, no. Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. So this must be impossible. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation. Wait, let me check once again:

The product of the off-diagonal terms is (i/3)*(-i/3)= (-i^2)/9=1/9. The determinant is (0.5)^2 +1/9=0.25 +0.111=0.361, which is 13/36. 

But when solving the quadratic equation, we have (0.5 - λ)^2 +1/9 =0, so (0.5 - λ)^2 =-1/9. Therefore, complex eigenvalues. But this is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup.

Wait, the determinant is (0.5 - λ)^2 - (-i/3)(i/3). Wait, the determinant of Y - λ I is:

(0.5 - λ)^2 - (i/3)(-i/3) = (0.5 - λ)^2 - (i^2)/9 = (0.5 - λ)^2 - (-1/9)= (0.5 -λ)^2 +1/9. 

Therefore, determinant is (0.5-λ)^2 +1/9 =0 → (0.5 -λ)^2 = -1/9 → complex. 

But Hermitian matrices must have real eigenvalues. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have messed up the matrix. Wait, unless the matrix is not Hermitian?

Wait, let me check again:

The (1,2) entry is i/3, so (2,1) is the conjugate, which is -i/3. Yes, so Hermitian. 

Wait, but then eigenvalues are complex? That can't be. What is going on here?

Wait, let me think numerically. Let me compute the eigenvalues numerically using another method.

Let me suppose an eigenvector [a; b]. Then:

Y*[a; b] = λ [a; b]

So,

0.5 a + (i/3) b = λ a

(-i/3) a +0.5 b = λ b

From first equation:

(0.5 - λ)a + (i/3) b =0 → (i/3) b = (λ -0.5)a → b= 3i/(λ -0.5) a

Plug into second equation:

- i/3 a +0.5*(3i/(λ -0.5) a ) = λ*(3i/(λ -0.5))a

Let me factor out 'a' (assuming non-zero):

 -i/3 + (0.5)(3i)/(λ -0.5) = λ*(3i)/(λ -0.5)

Multiply both sides by (λ -0.5):

 -i/3 (λ -0.5) + (0.5)(3i) = 3i λ

Simplify:

 -i/3 * λ + i/6 + 1.5i = 3i λ

Combine terms:

(-i/3 λ -3i λ) + (i/6 +1.5i) =0

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Left side: -i/3 (λ -0.5) + (0.5)(3i) 

= (-iλ/3 + i/6 ) + 1.5i 

= -iλ/3 +i/6 + 3i/2
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z, each with specific entries. The question is about the Bloch vector components for matrix Z. Hmm, first, I should recall what a Bloch vector is. 

The Bloch vector, right, is a way to represent a qubit's density matrix in terms of its components in a vector form using the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + v · σ)/2, where v is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). The components x, y, z correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, respectively. 

So, to get the Bloch vector components for matrix Z, I need to express Z in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. Let me write down matrix Z first. According to the problem, Z is given as:

Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Wait, the format is rows separated by semicolons, so the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. Let me confirm that. Yeah, so Z is a 2x2 matrix with entries:

Top left: 2/3

Top right: 1/4

Bottom left: 1/4

Bottom right: 1/3

Alright. Now, let me recall the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

And the identity matrix I is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. So, if we can represent ρ = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2, then the components of the Bloch vector v are (v_x, v_y, v_z).

Therefore, to find the Bloch vector components for Z, I need to express Z in that form. Let me set up the equation:

Z = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2

Then, multiplying both sides by 2:

2Z = I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z

So, I can subtract I from both sides:

2Z - I = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z

Let me compute 2Z first. Since Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]], then 2Z is:

2*(2/3) = 4/3, 2*(1/4)=1/2, so the first row is [4/3, 1/2], second row [1/2, 2/3].

Subtracting the identity matrix I (which has 1s on the diagonal), so:

2Z - I = [4/3 -1, 1/2; 1/2, 2/3 -1]

Calculating the diagonals:

4/3 - 1 = 1/3, and 2/3 - 1 = -1/3. Therefore:

2Z - I = [[1/3, 1/2], [1/2, -1/3]]

Now, this matrix should be equal to v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z. Let me write out each term:

v_x σ_x = v_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, v_x], [v_x, 0]]

v_y σ_y = v_y * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] = [[0, -i v_y], [i v_y, 0]]

v_z σ_z = v_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[v_z, 0], [0, -v_z]]

So adding these together:

v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z = [[v_z, v_x - i v_y], [v_x + i v_y, -v_z]]

Therefore, setting this equal to 2Z - I:

[[v_z, v_x - i v_y], [v_x + i v_y, -v_z]] = [[1/3, 1/2], [1/2, -1/3]]

Now, equate the corresponding elements:

Top left: v_z = 1/3

Bottom right: -v_z = -1/3 → which is consistent with v_z = 1/3.

Top right: v_x - i v_y = 1/2

Bottom left: v_x + i v_y = 1/2

So now, we have two equations for v_x and v_y:

1) v_x - i v_y = 1/2

2) v_x + i v_y = 1/2

If we add these two equations, the terms with i will cancel:

(1) + (2): 2 v_x = 1 ⇒ v_x = 1/2

Subtracting equation (1) from (2):

(2) - (1): 2 i v_y = 0 ⇒ v_y = 0/i = 0

Wait, hold on. Wait, if I subtract (1) from (2):

(v_x + i v_y) - (v_x - i v_y) = 1/2 - 1/2 ⇒ (2i v_y) = 0 ⇒ v_y =0

Hmm, so according to this, v_x = 1/2, v_y =0, and v_z =1/3.

But the question states that the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. But according to this, v_y is zero. That contradicts the given correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Let me go step by step.

First, 2Z is:

First row: 2*(2/3) = 4/3, 2*(1/4)=1/2

Second row: 2*(1/4)=1/2, 2*(1/3)=2/3

Then subtract I:

First diagonal: 4/3 -1 = 1/3

Second diagonal: 2/3 -1 = -1/3

Off-diagonal: 1/2 and 1/2, so the matrix is correct:

[[1/3, 1/2],[1/2, -1/3]]

Then, equate to v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z which gives:

Top left: v_z =1/3

Bottom right: -v_z = -1/3, so that's okay.

Top right is v_x - i v_y = 1/2

Bottom left is v_x + i v_y =1/2

So adding equations (1) and (2):

v_x -i v_y + v_x +i v_y =1/2 +1/2 → 2v_x=1 → v_x=1/2

Subtracting equation (1) from (2):

(v_x +i v_y) - (v_x -i v_y)= (1/2 -1/2) ⇒ 2i v_y =0 ⇒ v_y=0. 

Hmm. So according to this, v_y is zero. But the question states that every component of the Bloch vector is non-zero. That would mean that my calculation is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in the setup?

Wait, let me check again the Pauli matrices. Maybe I confused σ_y?

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when you multiply by v_y, the top right entry is -i v_y, and the bottom left is i v_y. So in the combination v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, the (1,2) entry is v_x (from σ_x) plus (-i v_y) from σ_y, so the top right is indeed v_x -i v_y. Similarly, the bottom left is v_x (from σ_x) plus i v_y (from σ_y). 

So that's correct, so equations are right. So v_y =0. Then the components would be v_x=1/2, v_y=0, v_z=1/3. So only the x and z components are non-zero, but y is zero. So why does the question say every component is non-zero?

Hmm, that suggests that maybe I made an error in the problem statement. Let me check again the matrix Z. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So is it possible that there was a typo in the problem's matrix? Maybe the off-diagonal terms have an "i" somewhere? Let me check again:

Original problem says:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Note: format is rows separated by semicolons. So the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. There's no i in there, unlike matrices W and Y which do have i terms. 

Hmm. But according to this, the off-diagonal entries are real numbers. Therefore, in the Bloch vector, the y-component comes from the imaginary part of the off-diagonal entries, right?

Wait a second, here's a different approach. Let me recall that the Bloch vector components can also be calculated via the trace of the matrix multiplied by each Pauli matrix. Specifically,

v_x = Tr(σ_x Z)

v_y = Tr(σ_y Z)

v_z = Tr(σ_z Z)

Wait, let me verify that. The expectation value ⟨σ_i⟩ = Tr(σ_i ρ). Since the density matrix ρ is Z in this case, so yes. So let's compute each component using traces.

First, let me compute v_x = Tr(σ_x Z).

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by Z:

σ_x Z = [[0*2/3 +1*1/4, 0*1/4 +1*1/3],[1*2/3 +0*1/4, 1*1/4 +0*1/3]]

Wait, actually, the trace is Tr(σ_x Z) = σ_x_{11}*Z_{11} + σ_x_{12}*Z_{12} + σ_x_{21}*Z_{21} + σ_x_{22}*Z_{22} ?

Wait no, the trace of a product is the sum over i,j of (σ_x)_{ij} Z_{ji}

Alternatively, perhaps better to just compute the product and take the trace.

Let me compute σ_x * Z:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], Z = [[2/3,1/4],[1/4,1/3]]

So multiplying σ_x * Z:

First row: [0*(2/3) + 1*(1/4), 0*(1/4) +1*(1/3)] → [1/4, 1/3]

Second row: [1*(2/3) + 0*(1/4), 1*(1/4) +0*(1/3)] → [2/3, 1/4]

So σ_x * Z is [[1/4,1/3],[2/3,1/4]]

The trace is the sum of diagonal elements: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Therefore, v_x = Tr(σ_x Z) = 1/2.

Similarly, v_z = Tr(σ_z Z). σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So σ_z * Z = [[2/3, 1/4],[ -1/4, -1/3]]

Wait, actually, the trace of σ_z Z is the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by 1 and -1 respectively. Let me compute:

Tr(σ_z Z) = (1)*(2/3) + (-1)*(1/3) = 2/3 -1/3 =1/3. So v_z =1/3.

Now, for v_y, which is Tr(σ_y Z). σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]

So σ_y * Z = [[0*2/3 + (-i)*(1/4), 0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3)], [i*(2/3) +0*(1/4), i*(1/4) +0*(1/3)]]

Calculating each entry:

Top left: (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

Top right: -i*(1/3) = -i/3

Bottom left: i*(2/3) = 2i/3

Bottom right: i*(1/4) =i/4

Therefore, σ_y Z matrix is:

[ -i/4, -i/3 ]

[ 2i/3, i/4 ]

The trace is (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. So Tr(σ_y Z) =0. Hence v_y=0.

Therefore, the Bloch vector components are (1/2, 0, 1/3). Therefore, the y-component is zero, so not all components are non-zero. But the question says the correct answer is "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero". That contradicts my calculations, so either there is a mistake in my process, or maybe the problem has a typo in the matrix Z?

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the matrix. Let me check again:

Original problem: Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). So first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. So the off-diagonal terms are both 1/4, real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero, so that gives v_y zero.

Hmm, unless the user made a typo. For example, if the off-diagonal terms had an imaginary unit, then v_y would not be zero. Let me see the other matrices. 

Looking at W: (1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2). So that's symmetric with imaginary terms. Similarly Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2). So those have imaginary off diagonals. Z is the only one with real off diagonals. Therefore, unless the problem had a different matrix for Z, but in the given problem statement, it's written as Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation of v_y?

Wait the trace of σ_y Z is the sum of the diagonal elements of σ_y Z. Wait σ_y Z is:

First element: (σ_y)_{11}*Z_{11} + (σ_y)_{12}*Z_{21}? Wait no, actually, the trace of a product is invariant under cyclic permutations, but perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, actually, the trace of AB is the sum over i,A_{i,j} B_{j,i}. So for σ_y Z, it's:

σ_y[1,1]*Z[1,1] + σ_y[1,2]*Z[2,1] + σ_y[2,1]*Z[1,2] + σ_y[2,2]*Z[2,2]

But trace only requires the diagonal elements of the product matrix. Wait, but when you multiply σ_y and Z, you have to do the full matrix multiplication and then take the trace.

Wait let me do that again:

σ_y * Z:

First row first column: σ_y[1,1]*Z[1,1] + σ_y[1,2]*Z[2,1] = 0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

First row second column: σ_y[1,1]*Z[1,2] + σ_y[1,2]*Z[2,2] =0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3)= -i/3

Second row first column: σ_y[2,1]*Z[1,1] + σ_y[2,2]*Z[2,1] =i*(2/3) +0*(1/4)= 2i/3

Second row second column: σ_y[2,1]*Z[1,2] + σ_y[2,2]*Z[2,2] =i*(1/4) +0*(1/3)=i/4

So the trace is the sum of the diagonal entries:

(-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. So indeed v_y=0. So according to this, the y-component is zero. So why is the correct answer that every component is non-zero?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula? Let me recall another method. The density matrix of a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2. Therefore, the Bloch vector components can also be calculated by:

v_x = 2*(ρ_{01} + ρ_{10})

Wait no, that might not be exactly right. Let me see:

Given that ρ = (I + v · σ)/2, then expanding this, we can write:

ρ = (I)/2 + (v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2

Therefore, each component can be found by looking at the coefficients in the matrix. Let me write out each Pauli matrix scaled by their coefficients and added to the identity.

The identity matrix over 2 gives the diagonal terms (1/2,1/2). The Pauli matrices contribute the rest. Let me express Z in terms of the identity and the Pauli matrices.

Given Z is:

[2/3, 1/4]

[1/4, 1/3]

So, subtract the identity matrix scaled by (1/2) to get the Pauli part:

Z - (I)/2 = [2/3 -1/2, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3 -1/2] = [ (4/6 -3/6)=1/6, 1/4;1/4, (2/6 -3/6)= -1/6 ]

So that gives:

[1/6, 1/4]

[1/4, -1/6]

This must be equal to (v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2. So multiply both sides by 2:

2*(Z - I/2) = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z

So,

Left side matrix is [1/3, 1/2; 1/2, -1/3], same as before. Then equating this to the Pauli terms gives the same equations leading to v_x=1/2, v_y=0, v_z=1/3. So, this confirms the same result.

Therefore, the Bloch vector for Z has components (1/2, 0,1/3). Therefore, the y-component is zero. But the problem states that the correct answer is that every component is non-zero. So there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, perhaps the question was not about matrix Z but another matrix? Let me check the original problem again.

The question says: "Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. ?"

Wait maybe I misread the matrix Z. Let me check again:

Original problem states:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait perhaps the user made a typo and swapped Z with another matrix? Like, maybe matrix Y or W? Let me check matrix Y:

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). For matrix Y, the off-diagonal terms are imaginary, so in that case, the v_y component would be non-zero. Let me see:

Calculating Bloch vector for Y:

First, compute 2Y - I:

2Y is [1, 2i/3; -2i/3, 1]

Subtracting I gives:

[0, 2i/3; -2i/3,0]

So this equals v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z. Since the trace is zero here, v_z must be 0. 

Equate to the Pauli terms:

The off-diagonal terms:

Top right is v_x -i v_y = 2i/3

Bottom left is v_x +i v_y = -2i/3

So adding equations: 2v_x =0 ⇒ v_x=0

Subtracting equations: 2i v_y = -2i/3 -2i/3 → Wait, let me actually do it properly:

Equation 1: v_x -i v_y = (2i)/3

Equation 2: v_x +i v_y = (-2i)/3

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(v_x +i v_y) - (v_x -i v_y) = (-2i/3 -2i/3) → 2i v_y = (-4i)/3 → v_y = (-4i/3)/(2i)= -2/3

Wait, so v_y = -2/3, but let me re-express.

Wait, solving equations:

Let me add equations:

v_x -i v_y = (2i)/3

v_x +i v_y = (-2i)/3

Adding them:

2v_x =0 ⇒ v_x=0

Subtracting first from second:

(v_x +i v_y) - (v_x -i v_y) = (-2i/3 - 2i/3)

Left side: 2i v_y

Right side: -4i/3 ⇒ 2i v_y = -4i/3 ⇒ v_y= -2/3

So v_y= -2/3, and v_z= (top left of 2Y -I is 0, so v_z=0. Wait, the top left of 2Y -I is zero, so from the equation, v_z =0. 

Therefore, the Bloch vector for Y is (0, -2/3, 0). So only y-component is non-zero. So y-component is non-zero, but others are zero. 

Similarly, for matrix W:

W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4,1/2). So similar to Y but different coefficients.

Compute 2W - I:

2W is [1, i/2; -i/2,1]. Subtract I: [0, i/2; -i/2,0]

Same as Y's case but with different coefficients. Then, v_x=0, v_y= ?

Equations:

Top right: v_x -i v_y =i/2, Bottom left: v_x +i v_y = -i/2

Adding gives v_x=0. Subtract gives:

(v_x +i v_y) - (v_x -i v_y) = (-i/2 -i/2) → 2i v_y = -i ⇒ v_y = -1/2. So Bloch vector (0, -1/2,0). 

So only y-component non-zero. 

Matrix X is (1/3,1;1, 2/3). Let me check its Bloch vector components:

Compute 2X - I = 2*(1/3,1;1,2/3) - I = (2/3,2;2,4/3) - (1,0;0,1) = (2/3-1, 2; 2,4/3-1) = (-1/3, 2; 2, 1/3)

Then equate to v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, which gives:

Top left: v_z = -1/3 

Bottom right: -v_z =1/3 ⇒ which is okay.

Top right entry: v_x -i v_y =2

Bottom left: v_x +i v_y =2

Adding equations: 2v_x =4 ⇒ v_x=2

Subtracting equations: 2i v_y =0 ⇒ v_y=0.

Therefore, v_x=2, v_y=0, v_z=-1/3. Wait, but the Pauli terms have coefficients divided by 2, so let me see again. Wait, actually, in the expression 2X - I = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, so:

Pauli terms must satisfy:

The matrix [[-1/3, 2],[2,1/3]] = v_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + v_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + v_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Therefore, the top left entry is v_z = -1/3

Top right: v_x -i v_y =2

Bottom left: v_x +i v_y=2

Same as before, so v_x=2, v_y=0, and v_z=-1/3. 

Thus, for matrix X, the Bloch vector is (2,0,-1/3). So x and z components non-zero, y zero.

Therefore, for all the other matrices except maybe Z, but in Z, we have v_x=1/2, v_z=1/3, and v_y=0. So only Z has non-zero x and z, but y is zero. 

Therefore, the statement that "every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero" would be false. But the problem says that this is the correct answer, so there must be an error somewhere. 

Wait a second - perhaps I misapplied the formula? Let me check another way. 

The Bloch vector components can also be calculated as follows:

For a density matrix ρ = [ [a, b],[c, d] ]

The Bloch vector components are:

v_x = 2*(Re(b))

v_y = 2*(Im(b))

v_z = 2*(a - d)

Wait is that correct? Let me recall.

Given ρ = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2,

Then, expanding this, the (1,1) entry is (1 + v_z)/2,

the (1,2) entry is (v_x - i v_y)/2,

the (2,1) entry is (v_x + i v_y)/2,

and the (2,2) entry is (1 - v_z)/2.

Therefore,

a = (1 + v_z)/2 ⇒ v_z = 2a -1,

Similarly,

The off-diagonal terms:

ρ_{12} = (v_x -i v_y)/2 ⇒ so solving,

v_x = 2 Re(ρ_{12})

v_y = -2 Im(ρ_{12})

Similarly for the other off-diagonal entry, since ρ_{21} = (v_x + i v_y)/2,

Therefore,

v_x = 2 Re(ρ_{21})

v_y = 2 Im(ρ_{21})

Wait, but in this case, for matrix Z, which is [[2/3,1/4],[1/4,1/3]], the off-diagonal terms are real numbers. So, ρ_{12}=1/4 and ρ_{21}=1/4, so their real parts are 1/4, imaginary parts are 0. Therefore,

v_x = 2*(1/4) = 1/2,

v_y = -2*(0) =0,

v_z = 2*(2/3) -1 = 4/3 -1 =1/3,

Which gives the same result as before. Therefore, the y-component is zero. 

So, given the problem's matrix Z as specified, the answer should be that the y-component is zero, so it's not the case that every component is non-zero. Therefore, either there is a typo in the problem, or perhaps I've made a fundamental mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different matrix?

Wait the question says "Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero.?" So, maybe there is confusion with matrix Y? Let me check matrix Y again:

Matrix Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2). The components here have imaginary off-diagonals, so in that case, the imaginary part is non-zero, so v_y would be non-zero. Let me compute it using the formula above.

For Y, the upper off-diagonal entry is i/3, so:

v_x = 2 Re(ρ_{12}) = 2*(0) =0,

v_y = -2 Im(ρ_{12})= -2*(1/3)= -2/3,

v_z =2*(1/2) -1=0,

So Bloch vector (0, -2/3,0). So only the y-component is non-zero. Wait so even worse, only y is non-zero. 

Hmm, so actually, for all the matrices except maybe Z, they have one or two non-zero components. For example, W has only y, X has x and z, Y has y, and Z has x and z. So none of them have all components non-zero?

Wait, but according to the problem, the correct answer is that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. So perhaps the problem is mistyped, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check once again for Z.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the trace for v_y? Let me recalculate v_y using the trace method:

v_y = Tr(σ_y Z). 

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], so multiplying σ_y and Z:

σ_y * Z = [[0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4), 0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3)], [i*(2/3)+0*(1/4), i*(1/4)+0*(1/3)]]

First row first column: -i*(1/4)

First row second column: -i*(1/3)

Second row first column: i*(2/3)

Second row second column: i*(1/4)

Then, the trace is the sum of the diagonal entries: (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0.

So yes, v_y=0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the vector as having components in all directions but computed incorrectly? Or perhaps the matrix Z is different? Let me check again the problem's exact wording.

"Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)". The semicolon separates rows, so first row is 2/3, 1/4. Second row is 1/4, 1/3. All entries real except for the first and third matrices (W and Y). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the matrix Z as having an imaginary component in the off-diagonal? For instance, if it were written as (2/3, i/4; i/4, 1/3), then the off-diagonal terms would be imaginary, but that is not the case here. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some convention the off-diagonal terms are multiplied by a factor? Wait no, the standard Bloch sphere uses the Pauli matrices as written. 

Alternatively, maybe the trace formula for v_y is different. Let me check another source in my mind. The standard formula for the Bloch vector components are:

v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x),

v_y = Tr(ρ σ_y),

v_z = Tr(ρ σ_z).

Given that, for matrix Z:

Tr(ρ σ_x) = 1/2,

Tr(ρ σ_y)=0,

Tr(ρ σ_z)=1/3,

So indeed, only two components non-zero. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that there is a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the question is formulated incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source where they consider the diagonal entries as components? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the vector as having components in all directions because it's not aligned with the axes, but mathematically, the components are zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the real and imaginary parts are separate? Wait no, the v_y depends on the imaginary part of the off-diagonal. Since those are real numbers, their imaginary parts are zero. 

Hmm. I must be missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, where "every component" refers to the real and imaginary parts of the matrix elements, but that's not the standard interpretation. 

Wait, the Bloch vector is a real vector with three components. If all three components are non-zero, then the vector is not aligned with any axis. In this case, for Z, two components are non-zero, but since v_y=0, it's in the x-z plane. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different matrix for Z. Let me check if there was a typo in the problem's matrix entry for Z. Suppose instead of 1/4, if it was i/4, then:

If Z were [[2/3, i/4],[i/4, 1/3]], then the calculation would proceed as:

2Z = [4/3, i/2; i/2, 2/3]

2Z -I = [1/3, i/2; i/2, -1/3]

Then, equate to v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z:

Top left: v_z =1/3

Bottom right: -v_z = -1/3 ⇒ consistent.

Top right: v_x -i v_y =i/2,

Bottom left: v_x +i v_y =i/2,

Adding equations: 2v_x = i ⇒ v_x= i/2. But v_x should be real. Therefore, that can't be, because Bloch vector components are real numbers. 

Thus, that matrix would not represent a valid density matrix, as the off-diagonal terms are imaginary but the Pauli decomposition would require imaginary components in v_x or v_y, but the coefficients must be real. Therefore, that matrix would not be a valid density matrix unless the off-diagonal terms are complex conjugates, which they are in this case, so actually, if the off-diagonal terms were imaginary, but for example, if the matrix is Hermitian. 

Wait, the matrix Z as defined is Hermitian because its entries are real, so it's symmetric. If we had an imaginary entry in the off-diagonal, like (2/3, i/4; -i/4, 1/3), that would also be Hermitian, which is valid. Let's try that scenario:

Suppose Z is [[2/3, i/4], [-i/4,1/3]], which is Hermitian. Then, calculating the Bloch components:

First, compute 2Z - I:

2Z = [4/3, i/2; -i/2, 2/3]

Subtract I: 

[4/3-1, i/2; -i/2, 2/3 -1] = [1/3, i/2; -i/2, -1/3]

Then equate to v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z:

Top left: v_z=1/3

Bottom right: -v_z= -1/3 ⇒ consistent.

Top right entry: v_x -i v_y = i/2,

Bottom left: v_x +i v_y = -i/2,

Adding equations:

2v_x = (i/2 -i/2)=0 ⇒ v_x=0,

Subtracting:

(v_x +i v_y) - (v_x -i v_y)= (-i/2 -i/2)= -i ⇒ 2i v_y= -i ⇒ v_y= -1/2,

Thus, v_x=0, v_y= -1/2, v_z=1/3,

So all components are non-zero (since 0 is not considered non-zero?), but actually v_x is zero. Wait, no, v_x is zero,
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Let me start by recalling what a Bloch vector is. I know that in quantum computing, any single-qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere, which uses a Bloch vector to describe the state. The Bloch vector components are related to the Pauli matrices X, Y, and Z. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2, where the vector (v_x, v_y, v_z) is the Bloch vector. 

So, the task here is to find the Bloch vector for the matrix Z given and check whether all its components (v_x, v_y, v_z) are non-zero. Let me first write down the matrix Z again to make sure I have it right. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). 

Assuming the semicolon separates the rows, so the matrix is:

[2/3   1/4]
[1/4  1/3]

Alright, now I need to compute the Bloch vector components for this matrix. To do this, I need to express Z in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
Identity matrix I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

So the standard form is (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2. Therefore, if I can express Z in that form, then the coefficients v_x, v_y, v_z will be the components of its Bloch vector.

Let me denote the given matrix Z as:

Z = [ a    b ]
        [ c    d ]

Given that matrices are Hermitian (since they are density matrices), so the off-diagonal elements should be conjugates of each other. Let me check that first. In Z, the (1,2) element is 1/4, so the (2,1) element should be the conjugate of 1/4. Since 1/4 is real, that's okay. So the matrix is Hermitian. Good.

The trace of Z should be 1 because it's a density matrix. Let me check the trace: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Okay, that's correct.

Now, let's write the general expression for a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector:

ρ = (I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z)/2.

So, if I multiply both sides by 2:

2ρ = I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z.

Then, subtract the identity matrix:

2ρ - I = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z.

Therefore, the right-hand side must equal that expression. Let's compute 2ρ - I for matrix Z.

First, compute 2ρ:

2 * Z = 2*[2/3   1/4] = [4/3   1/2]
          [1/4  1/3]   [1/2  2/3]

Subtracting the identity matrix I (which is [1 0; 0 1]):

2Z - I = [4/3 - 1,    1/2     ]
          [1/2   ,  2/3 - 1 ]

Calculating each element:

First element: 4/3 - 1 = 1/3

Second element in the first row: 1/2 (since that's the (1,2) entry)

Second row, first element: 1/2

Second row, second element: 2/3 - 1 = -1/3

So the matrix 2Z - I is:

[1/3     1/2 ]
[1/2   -1/3 ]

Now, this matrix must equal v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z.

Let's compute each term:

v_x σ_x = v_x * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, v_x], [v_x, 0]]

v_y σ_y = v_y * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i v_y], [i v_y, 0]]

v_z σ_z = v_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[v_z, 0], [0, -v_z]]

Adding these together:

v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z = 

[ v_z, -i v_y + v_x ] 
[ v_x + i v_y, -v_z ]

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, the (1,1) component is v_z, because from σ_z. 

The (1,2) component comes from σ_x's (1,2) entry, which is v_x, and σ_y's (1,2) entry, which is -i v_y. So combined, that's v_x - i v_y? Wait, hold on, actually, σ_x has (1,2) entry as 1, so multiplying by v_x gives v_x. Similarly, σ_y's (1,2) entry is -i, so multiplying by v_y gives -i v_y. Therefore, the (1,2) component is v_x - i v_y. But in the actual matrix, this component is 1/2. Hmm, but the (1,2) component in 2Z - I is 1/2, which is a real number. However, in the expression v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, the (1,2) component is v_x (from σ_x) plus (σ_y contributes -i v_y). Wait, but the sum should be a complex number?

Wait, but the left-hand side, 2Z - I, is a Hermitian matrix. Since Z is Hermitian, 2Z - I is also Hermitian. Let me check the (1,2) component of 2Z - I is 1/2, and the (2,1) component is also 1/2, which is the conjugate, which is okay because 1/2 is real.

Therefore, to match the real components of the (1,2) entry, which is 1/2, the expression from Pauli matrices should also have a real value here. Let me see:

Wait, actually, in the (1,2) component of v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, we have v_x (from σ_x) plus (-i v_y) from σ_y. But this is a complex number unless the imaginary part cancels out. Since the total must be real because 2Z - I is Hermitian, so the off-diagonal terms must be the conjugate of each other. Since the (1,2) entry is 1/2 (a real number), then the (2,1) entry must be 1/2 as well, which is consistent. 

Therefore, the (1,2) entry is v_x - i v_y, but since it's equal to 1/2, which is real, so the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore, the imaginary component comes from -i v_y, so to make that zero, v_y must be zero? Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement's answer, which says that all components are non-zero. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the equations step by step.

Let me denote the matrix equation:

v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z = [1/3     1/2
                                 1/2    -1/3]

Breaking this down into components:

The (1,1) component:

v_z (from σ_z) = 1/3

So v_z = 1/3.

The (2,2) component is -v_z (from σ_z) which should be equal to -1/3. Let's check:

If v_z = 1/3, then -v_z = -1/3, which matches the (2,2) entry. Good.

Now the (1,2) component:

From σ_x: v_x (since σ_x's (1,2) entry is 1)
From σ_y: -i v_y (since σ_y's (1,2) entry is -i)
So combined: v_x - i v_y = 1/2 (which is the (1,2) entry of the right-hand side matrix).

Similarly, the (2,1) component:

From σ_x: v_x (since σ_x's (2,1) entry is 1)
From σ_y: i v_y (since σ_y's (2,1) entry is i)
So combined: v_x + i v_y = 1/2 (since the (2,1) entry of the RHS is 1/2, which is the conjugate of the (1,2) entry. Since 1/2 is real, they are equal).

Therefore, we have two equations from the off-diagonal terms:

v_x - i v_y = 1/2 (Equation 1)

v_x + i v_y = 1/2 (Equation 2)

Wait, if we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get 2i v_y = 0 => v_y = 0. But then substituting back into Equation 1 gives v_x = 1/2.

But that would imply that v_y is zero, which would contradict the answer that all components are non-zero. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made an error here?

Wait, but the answer states that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero. However, according to this calculation, v_y is zero. That suggests either my calculation is wrong, or maybe I misunderstood the problem?

Wait, let me check the off-diagonal entries again. Let me re-express the equations:

From the (1,2) entry of the Pauli combination:

v_x (from σ_x) + (-i v_y) (from σ_y) = 1/2.

From the (2,1) entry of the Pauli combination:

v_x (from σ_x) + (i v_y) (from σ_y) = 1/2.

These two equations:

1) v_x - i v_y = 1/2

2) v_x + i v_y = 1/2

Adding equations 1 and 2: 2v_x = 1 ⇒ v_x = 1/2.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 2i v_y = 0 ⇒ v_y = 0.

Therefore, v_x=1/2, v_y=0, v_z=1/3.

Therefore, the Bloch vector components are (v_x, v_y, v_z) = (1/2, 0, 1/3). But the problem says "every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero". But according to this, v_y is zero. Hmm, so this contradicts the answer given. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the matrix entries again. Let me re-calculate 2Z - I.

Original Z is:

[2/3   1/4]
[1/4   1/3]

Multiplying by 2 gives:

[4/3   1/2]
[1/2   2/3]

Subtracting the identity matrix [1,0; 0,1], so:

[4/3 -1, 1/2 -0] → [1/3, 1/2]

[1/2 -0, 2/3 -1] → [1/2, -1/3]

Yes, that's correct. So the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are both 1/2, which are real. Therefore, indeed, when setting up the equations, since the imaginary part of the off-diagonal terms must cancel out to give a real number, so the imaginary component from v_y must be zero. Hence, v_y = 0.

Hmm, that's conflicting with the given answer. Wait, maybe I made an error in setting up the equations? Let me check the Pauli matrices again.

Wait, let's re-express the combination v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z:

σ_x matrix:
[0, 1]
[1, 0]

σ_y matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

σ_z matrix:
[1, 0]
[0, -1]

So when you multiply each by their coefficients and add them up:

v_x σ_x has entries: [0, v_x; v_x, 0]

v_y σ_y has entries: [0, -i v_y; i v_y, 0]

v_z σ_z has entries: [v_z, 0; 0, -v_z]

Adding them all together:

Top-left entry: v_z (from σ_z) + 0 (others) = v_z

Top-right entry: v_x (from σ_x) + (-i v_y from σ_y) + 0 (σ_z) = v_x - i v_y

Bottom-left entry: v_x (from σ_x) + (i v_y from σ_y) + 0 (σ_z) = v_x + i v_y

Bottom-right entry: -v_z (from σ_z) + 0 (others) = -v_z

Therefore, that's correct. So the equations are as before.

Wait, but according to this, the (1,2) entry is v_x - i v_y, and the (2,1) entry is v_x + i v_y, so these must both be equal to the off-diagonal entries of 2Z - I, which are 1/2 and 1/2 (since they are real and equal). 

Therefore, setting them equal to 1/2 gives:

v_x - i v_y = 1/2 (equation 1)

v_x + i v_y = 1/2 (equation 2)

Adding equations 1 and 2 gives 2v_x = 1 ⇒ v_x = 1/2.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives 2i v_y = 0 ⇒ v_y = 0.

Therefore, indeed, v_y = 0. So then, the v_y component is zero. But the problem's correct answer is that all components are non-zero. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, either there is a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps I misread the matrix Z?

Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, the user wrote "Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)", so the off-diagonal elements are 1/4 and 1/4, but when multiplied by 2, they become 1/2 and 1/2. So that's correct.

Hmm, so unless there's a different way to construct the Bloch vector, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula for the Bloch vector. Let me recall the standard formula. 

For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are given by:

v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x)

v_y = Tr(ρ σ_y)

v_z = Tr(ρ σ_z)

Ah! Maybe I should compute the components using the trace instead of trying to express the matrix in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me try this approach to verify.

Indeed, the components of the Bloch vector can be directly calculated by taking the trace of the matrix multiplied by each Pauli matrix. 

So, let me compute v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x)

First, ρ is the matrix Z: [2/3   1/4; 1/4  1/3]

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So ρ σ_x is:

First row: (2/3 * 0 + 1/4 * 1, 2/3 * 1 + 1/4 * 0 ) → (1/4, 2/3)

Second row: (1/4 * 0 + 1/3 * 1, 1/4 *1 +1/3 *0 ) → (1/3, 1/4 )

Therefore, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: (1/4) + (1/4) = 1/2. So v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x) = 1/2.

Similarly, v_z = Tr(ρ σ_z). σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Compute ρ σ_z:

[2/3 *1 + 1/4 *0, 2/3 *0 +1/4*(-1) ]

[1/4 *1 +1/3 *0, 1/4*0 +1/3*(-1) ]

So entries:

First row: [2/3, -1/4]

Second row: [1/4, -1/3]

Trace is (2/3) + (-1/3) = 1/3. So v_z = 1/3.

Now, v_y = Tr(ρ σ_y). σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Compute ρ σ_y:

First row: (2/3 *0 +1/4 *i, 2/3*(-i) +1/4*0 ) → (i/4, - (2i)/3 )

Second row: (1/4 *0 +1/3 *i, 1/4*(-i) +1/3 *0 ) → (i/3, -i/4 )

Therefore, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. 

Thus, v_y = 0. 

Hmm, that's the same result as before. Therefore, according to both methods, v_y is zero. But the problem states that the correct answer is "Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero." That contradicts my calculations here. So either I did something wrong, or maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options?

Alternatively, maybe I misread the matrix Z? Let me check again.

The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Assuming the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row is [1/4, 1/3], which is what I used. But perhaps the off-diagonal elements are complex? Wait, in the other matrices (W and Y), the off-diagonal elements have imaginary units. Maybe in Z's case, the user missed specifying an imaginary unit?

Wait, let me look again at the problem's matrices:

- W: (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So the off-diagonal elements are i/4 and -i/4. So that's complex.

- X: (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Here the off-diagonal elements are 1 and 1, real numbers.

- Y: (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). Again, imaginary off-diagonal elements.

- Z: (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). The off-diagonal elements here are 1/4 and 1/4, real. 

Therefore, as per the problem statement, Z has real off-diagonal elements, so v_y must be zero. 

Therefore, according to my calculations, the answer that every component of Z's Bloch vector is non-zero is incorrect. But the problem states that this is the correct answer. Hmm, so where is the mistake?

Wait a second. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the notation. The problem says "the format of the above matrices is such that the semicolon separates the rows." So, for example, matrix Z is written as (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3), meaning the first row is [2/3, 1/4], second row [1/4, 1/3]. That part seems correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the off-diagonal elements to have an imaginary component but accidentally omitted it? Let me check the problem statement again:

The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, in X, the off-diagonal elements are real (1), whereas in Z they are 1/4. But in W and Y, they have imaginary units. So unless there is a typo here, perhaps in Z the off-diagonal elements are actually complex but written without the imaginary unit. Maybe a formatting error?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v_y. Let me recalculate v_y using the trace formula.

v_y = Tr(ρ σ_y). Let's compute ρ σ_y again.

ρ is Z:

[2/3  1/4]

[1/4  1/3]

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Multiplying ρ * σ_y:

First row: 

First element: (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(i) = i/4

Second element: (2/3)(-i) + (1/4)(0) = - (2i)/3

Second row:

First element: (1/4)(0) + (1/3)(i) = i/3

Second element: (1/4)(-i) + (1/3)(0) = -i/4

Thus, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: (i/4) + (-i/4) = 0. So, indeed, v_y = 0.

Hmm. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's assertion? Or maybe I misunderstood the question? Let me read again.

The question says: "Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero?"

Wait, perhaps the matrices are written differently. For instance, maybe the off-diagonal entries of Z are complex? Let me think again. Suppose that in the problem statement, the user mistyped the Z matrix. For example, perhaps the matrix Z is supposed to be (2/3, i/4; -i/4, 1/3), similar to W and Y. In that case, the off-diagonal elements would be complex, leading to a non-zero v_y. But according to the user's input, it's written as "2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3", so the off-diagonal elements are real.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different Bloch vector definition where components are scaled differently? Wait, the standard definition is Tr(ρ σ_i) for each component. Alternatively, perhaps the components are calculated as 2*Tr(ρ σ_i), but no, the standard formula is Tr(ρ σ_i).

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the components as [Tr(ρ σ_x), Tr(ρ σ_y), Tr(ρ σ_z)], but even so, in that case, v_y would still be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the decomposition of the matrix into Pauli matrices differently? Let me see, maybe the user is considering a different parametrization.

Wait, another thought: the density matrix can also be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. Therefore, the coefficients v_x, v_y, v_z correspond to the components of the Bloch vector, so the components are exactly the terms in front of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So when we write 2ρ = I + v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z, then yes, the coefficients v_x, etc., are the components of the Bloch vector. So, in this case, I found v_x=1/2, v_y=0, v_z=1/3, so only v_y is zero. Therefore, the statement "every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero" is false. So why is this the correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of v_x?

Wait, let me recheck v_x:

v_x = Tr(ρ σ_x) = [ (2/3)(0) + (1/4)(1) ] + [ (1/4)(1) + (1/3)(0) ] ?

Wait, no, wait, when I calculated earlier, I did ρ σ_x first and then took the trace, which was (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2. Alternatively, Tr(σ_x ρ)? Wait, the trace is linear and Tr(AB) = Tr(BA), so it doesn't matter the order. 

Alternatively, maybe I should do it again:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying with ρ:

ρ σ_x = [ [2/3*0 + 1/4*1, 2/3*1 + 1/4*0], [1/4*0 + 1/3*1, 1/4*1 + 1/3*0] ]

Which is [ [1/4, 2/3], [1/3, 1/4] ]

Then, trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So that's correct.

Hmm, so unless there's a mistake in the problem's given matrices or the question itself, I can't see how Z's Bloch vector would have all components non-zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the matrix Z as the state vector instead of a density matrix? Wait, but it's written as a 2x2 matrix with trace 1, so it's a density matrix. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the components as v_x, v_y, v_z scaled by 2? Let me see:

In the expression 2ρ = I + ... then the coefficients v_x, etc., are the Bloch vector components. Alternatively, if the Bloch vector is defined as (v_x, v_y, v_z), then the answer is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation in the v_z component?

Wait, v_z = Tr(ρ σ_z):

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

ρ σ_z:

First row: [2/3*1 + 1/4*0, 2/3*0 +1/4*(-1)] → [2/3, -1/4]

Second row: [1/4*1 + 1/3*0, 1/4*0 +1/3*(-1)] → [1/4, -1/3]

Trace: 2/3 + (-1/3) = 1/3. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the correct matrix is different, but as per the given information, Z has a zero component in v_y. 

Wait, let me check the other matrices to see if maybe I can get some insight. For instance, looking at matrix Y: (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2). Let's compute its Bloch vector components quickly.

For matrix Y, let's compute v_x, v_y, v_z.

v_x = Tr(Y σ_x):

Y is [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3,1/2]]

Multiply by σ_x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]):

Y σ_x = [ [1/2*0 + (i/3)*1, 1/2*1 + (i/3)*0], [ -i/3*0 +1/2*1, -i/3*1 +1/2*0 ] ]

So entries:

First row: [i/3, 1/2]

Second row: [1/2, -i/3]

Trace is i/3 + (-i/3) = 0. So v_x =0?

Wait, but that contradicts. Wait, the trace is (i/3) + (-i/3) = 0, so v_x = 0? Wait, but let me check again:

Wait, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. The diagonal entries of Y σ_x are (i/3 and -i/3). So their sum is 0. Therefore, v_x =0.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it as v_x = Tr(Y σ_x). Let me do it directly:

Compute Tr(Y σ_x):

Y σ_x is the above, so trace is (i/3) + (-i/3) =0. So v_x is 0?

Hmm, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Wait, actually, alternatively:

Wait, actually, the standard formula is Tr(ρ σ_x). Let me compute σ_x Y and take trace?

Wait, no, trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, so Tr(Y σ_x) = Tr(σ_x Y). Let's compute σ_x Y:

σ_x Y = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3, 1/2]]

First row: 

[0*1/2 +1*(-i/3), 0*(i/3) +1*(1/2) ] → [ -i/3, 1/2 ]

Second row:

[1*(1/2) +0*(-i/3), 1*(i/3) +0*(1/2) ] → [1/2, i/3 ]

Trace is (-i/3 + i/3) =0. So same result.

Therefore, v_x is 0.

Hmm, but then what about v_y?

Compute v_y = Tr(Y σ_y):

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]]

Y σ_y = [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3,1/2]] * [[0, -i], [i,0]]

First row:

[1/2*0 + (i/3)*i, 1/2*(-i) + (i/3)*0 ]

Calculates to:

First element: (i/3)*i = i²/3 = -1/3

Second element: (1/2)(-i) = -i/2

Second row:

[-i/3 *0 + 1/2*i, -i/3*(-i) +1/2 *0 ]

First element of second row: (1/2)*i

Second element: (-i/3)(-i) = (i^2)/3 = -1/3

Therefore, the matrix Y σ_y is:

[ -1/3, -i/2 ]

[ i/2, -1/3 ]

Trace is (-1/3) + (-1/3) = -2/3.

Wait, but the trace is the sum of diagonals: -1/3 + (-1/3) = -2/3. Therefore, v_y = -2/3?

Wait, but wait, Y is a density matrix. Let me see if the trace is correct. Alternatively, maybe I need to recompute:

Wait, let me do it step by step again:

First row of Y is [1/2, i/3]; multiplying by first column of σ_y (which is [0; i]):

(1/2)*0 + (i/3)*i = (i^2)/3 = -1/3

First row, second column: [1/2, i/3] multiplied by second column of σ_y, which is [-i; 0]

= (1/2)*(-i) + (i/3)*0 = -i/2

Second row of Y is [-i/3, 1/2]; multiplied by first column of σ_y (0; i):

= (-i/3)*0 + (1/2)*i = (i)/2

Second row, second column: [-i/3,1/2] * [-i; 0] 

= (-i/3)*(-i) + (1/2)*0 = (i^2)/3 +0 = -1/3

Therefore, the trace is indeed -1/3 -1/3 = -2/3. So v_y = Tr(Y σ_y) = -2/3. 

Then v_z = Tr(Y σ_z). Let's compute Y σ_z:

Y is diagonal entries [1/2, 1/2], so multiplying by σ_z (which has [1, -1] on diagonals):

Trace is (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(-1) = 0. So v_z =0?

Wait, Y's diagonal elements are both 1/2, so Tr(Y σ_z) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(-1) = 0.

Therefore, the Bloch vector for Y is (v_x, v_y, v_z) = (0, -2/3, 0). But since Bloch vector components can be negative, but in any case, some components are non-zero. Wait, but according to the problem's options? Wait, but the question is about Z's vector. 

But maybe this example shows that even if the off-diagonal elements have imaginary parts, the Bloch components can still be non-zero. 

Wait, but in the case of Y, the off-diagonal elements are imaginary, so gives a non-zero v_y component. In Z's case, since the off-diagonal are real, the v_y component is zero. 

Therefore, unless there is a misunderstanding here, perhaps the correct answer should be that Z's Bloch vector has a zero component (v_y). But the problem states the correct answer is the opposite. Maybe the problem is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the real and imaginary parts of the off-diagonal elements as separate components? But in the Bloch vector, those are combined into the v_y component through the imaginary part. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different convention for the Bloch vector. For instance, sometimes the Bloch vector is defined such that the components are (Tr(ρ σ_x), Tr(ρ σ_y), Tr(ρ σ_z)), so in that case, for Z, that would be (1/2, 0, 1/3). Therefore, v_y is zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a different parametrization where the components are scaled differently. For instance, if the density matrix is written as:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2,

then the Bloch vector is (r_x, r_y, r_z). In that case, the components are the coefficients from this decomposition, so for Z, we had:

2Z - I = (1/3)*I + (1/2) σ_x + 0 σ_y + (1/3 - 1) σ_z? Wait, no. Wait, let me see:

We had earlier:

2Z - I = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z,

where we found v_x=1/2, v_y=0, v_z=1/3 - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal components:

The matrix 2Z - I had (1/3 and -1/3) on the diagonal. So the trace of 2Z - I is 0. 

Wait, let me re-express:

The diagonal entries of 2Z - I are 1/3 and -1/3. So for the decomposition:

2Z - I = v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. Let me start by recalling what a Bloch vector is. 

The Bloch vector, right, represents a qubit state in terms of the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector (often denoted as r) is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component is calculated using the trace of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the density matrix. Specifically, x = Tr(σ_x ρ), y = Tr(σ_y ρ), and z = Tr(σ_z ρ). Here, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. 

First, let me write down the Pauli matrices to make sure I have them right:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

So, given a matrix like Z, which is given as (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3). Let me parse that correctly. The first row is 2/3, 1/4, and the second row is 1/4, 1/3. So in matrix form:

Z = [ [2/3, 1/4],
       [1/4, 1/3] ]

Wait, but before proceeding, I should check if Z is a valid density matrix. A density matrix must be Hermitian, have trace 1, and be positive semi-definite.

First, checking Hermitian: the (1,2) entry is 1/4 and the (2,1) entry is also 1/4, which is the conjugate of 1/4, so that's fine. So it's Hermitian.

Trace is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, so that's good.

Positive semi-definite: The eigenvalues should be non-negative. Let me check the eigenvalues. The determinant is (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)^2 = (2/9) - (1/16) = (32/144 - 9/144) = 23/144. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is 1, both eigenvalues are positive. So yes, it's a valid density matrix.

Now, to compute its Bloch vector components. Let's compute x, y, z.

First, compute x = Tr(σ_x * Z). Let's compute σ_x multiplied by Z.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by Z:

σ_x * Z = [[0*(2/3) + 1*(1/4), 0*(1/4) + 1*(1/3)],
           [1*(2/3) + 0*(1/4), 1*(1/4) + 0*(1/3)]]

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication is row times column. Let me compute it step by step:

First row of σ_x times first column of Z:

0 * (2/3) + 1 * (1/4) = 1/4

First row of σ_x times second column of Z:

0 * (1/4) + 1 * (1/3) = 1/3

Second row of σ_x times first column of Z:

1 * (2/3) + 0 * (1/4) = 2/3

Second row of σ_x times second column of Z:

1 * (1/4) + 0 * (1/3) = 1/4

So σ_x * Z is [[1/4, 1/3], [2/3, 1/4]]

Then trace of that matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2? Wait, no:

Wait, hold on, let me check again:

Wait the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product matrix. The product matrix σ_x Z is:

First row: [1/4, 1/3]

Second row: [2/3, 1/4]

So the diagonal elements are 1/4 and 1/4. Therefore, trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So x component is 1/2. Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, actually, the trace of (σ_x * Z) is Tr(σ_x Z). Hmm, but let me confirm the multiplication again.

Alternatively, maybe I should recall that for Pauli matrices, the expectation value Tr(σ_i ρ) can also be calculated as 2*(top right element) for σ_x, but maybe that's only for the Pauli matrices themselves. Wait, perhaps I should use another method.

Alternatively, the trace of σ_x Z is the sum over i,j of (σ_x)_{i,j} Z_{j,i} ?

Wait, maybe another way: the trace of AB is the same as trace of BA, so Tr(σ_x Z) = Tr(Z σ_x). Maybe that's easier?

Let me compute Z σ_x:

Z is [[2/3,1/4],[1/4,1/3]]

Multiply by σ_x which is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So Z σ_x:

First row: (2/3)*0 + (1/4)*1 = 1/4; (2/3)*1 + (1/4)*0 = 2/3

Second row: (1/4)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3; (1/4)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 1/4

So Z σ_x is [[1/4, 2/3], [1/3, 1/4]]

Then the trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So same as before, so Tr(σ_x Z)=1/2. So x = 1/2.

Wait, so the x-component is 1/2. That's non-zero.

Now, the y-component: Tr(σ_y Z).

Let me compute σ_y Z. σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Multiplying σ_y * Z:

First row of σ_y times first column of Z:

0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4) = -i/4

First row times second column of Z:

0*(1/4) + (-i)*(1/3) = -i/3

Second row times first column:

i*(2/3) + 0*(1/4) = i*(2/3)

Second row times second column:

i*(1/4) + 0*(1/3) = i/4

Thus, σ_y * Z is [ [-i/4, -i/3], [i*2/3, i/4] ]

Taking the trace, which is (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0? Wait, so Tr(σ_y Z)= (-i/4 + i/4)=0? Hmm, but then the y-component would be zero?

Wait a second, that contradicts the answer given. Because the answer says "every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero". But according to this, the y-component is zero. Did I make a mistake here?

Let me check the calculation again. Let me compute Tr(σ_y Z) again.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the multiplication.

First, σ_y Z:

First entry (row 1, column 1):

(0)(2/3) + (-i)(1/4) = -i/4

Row 1, column 2:

(0)(1/4) + (-i)(1/3) = -i/3

Row 2, column 1:

(i)(2/3) + (0)(1/4) = (2i)/3

Row 2, column 2:

(i)(1/4) + (0)(1/3) = i/4

So the matrix is:

[ -i/4   -i/3 ]

[ (2i)/3   i/4 ]

Trace is (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. So that's correct. So the y-component is zero?

Hmm, but the answer says every component is non-zero. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute Tr(Z σ_y) instead, since trace is invariant under cyclic permutations. Let me try that.

Compute Z σ_y:

Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]]

Multiply by σ_y on the right?

Wait, no, Z σ_y would be Z multiplied by σ_y. Let me compute that.

First row of Z times first column of σ_y:

(2/3)*0 + (1/4)*i = (i/4)

First row times second column of σ_y:

(2/3)*(-i) + (1/4)*0 = - (2i)/3

Second row of Z times first column of σ_y:

(1/4)*0 + (1/3)*i = (i)/3

Second row times second column of σ_y:

(1/4)*(-i) + (1/3)*0 = -i/4

Thus, the matrix Z σ_y is:

[ [i/4, -2i/3], [i/3, -i/4] ]

Trace is i/4 + (-i/4) = 0. So same result. So trace of σ_y Z is the same as trace of Z σ_y, which is zero. So the y-component is zero. Hmm. But the answer says all components are non-zero. So that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the components. Let me check another component.

The z-component is Tr(σ_z Z). Let's compute that.

First, σ_z Z:

σ_z is diagonal matrix [1,0;0,-1]

So multiplying by Z:

σ_z * Z = [1*(2/3) + 0*(1/4), 1*(1/4) + 0*(1/3); 0*(2/3) + (-1)*(1/4), 0*(1/4) + (-1)*(1/3)]

Wait, no, actually, σ_z is diag(1, -1), so multiplying with Z:

First entry (row 1, col1): 1*(2/3) = 2/3

First row, column 2: 1*(1/4) = 1/4

Second row, column 1: (-1)*(1/4) = -1/4

Second row, column 2: (-1)*(1/3) = -1/3

Thus, σ_z * Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [-1/4, -1/3]]

Trace is 2/3 + (-1/3) = (2 -1)/3 = 1/3. So z-component is 1/3, which is non-zero.

So so far, x-component is 1/2, y-component is 0, z-component is 1/3. Therefore, the y-component is zero. But the answer says all components are non-zero. So either I made a mistake here, or the answer is wrong?

Wait, maybe I messed up the order of multiplication? Let me recall that the trace of σ_y Z is the same as trace of Z σ_y, but in my calculation, they both gave zero, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about the vector components in a different parametrization? Wait, the standard Bloch vector is (Tr(σ_x ρ), Tr(σ_y ρ), Tr(σ_z ρ)). So if that's the case, the components would be (1/2, 0, 1/3). So the y-component is zero, so the answer should not be correct. But the question says that the correct answer is that every component of the Bloch vector of Z is non-zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the trace for σ_y Z?

Wait let's do the trace of σ_y Z again. The trace is sum of the diagonal elements.

σ_y Z is:

First row first column: -i/4, second row second column: i/4

Diagonal elements: -i/4 and i/4. So adding them gives (-i + i)/4 = 0. So yes, that's zero. So y-component is zero.

Hmm, so either the question is wrong, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to matrix Z as the Bloch vector? Wait no, the question says "the Bloch vector of Z".

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the components. Let me check the x-component again.

Tr(σ_x Z):

σ_x Z was computed as [[1/4, 1/3], [2/3, 1/4]], so trace is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the density matrix but about the state vector? Wait no, because the matrices given are not necessarily pure states. For example, the trace of Z is 1, so it is a density matrix. So it can be a mixed state. The Bloch vector can still be defined for mixed states.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different convention? For example, sometimes the Bloch vector is defined with a factor of 2? Let me see. Let me recall that for a pure state, the Bloch vector components are ±1 on the sphere, but for mixed states, they are scaled down. Wait, but in the standard definition, Tr(σ_i ρ) gives the components directly. However, maybe in some references they define the Bloch vector as r = 2 Tr(σ_i ρ) - 1 or something? Wait, no, I think the standard is just the trace. Let me check.

Suppose the state is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. Then the expectation value ⟨σ_i⟩ = Tr(σ_i |ψ⟩⟨ψ|) = ⟨ψ | σ_i |ψ⟩, so the Bloch vector is (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩). For a mixed state, it's the same: (Tr(σ_x ρ), Tr(σ_y ρ), Tr(σ_z ρ)). So the calculation should be correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the question's answer is wrong? Or maybe I misread the matrix entries?

Wait, let me recheck the matrix Z. The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

So the first row is 2/3, 1/4; second row 1/4, 1/3. So my calculation was correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the components of the vector in a different parametrization? Like, sometimes people use (x, y, z) scaled differently?

Alternatively, maybe the problem was about the X matrix instead of Z? Let me check the question again.

"Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. Why the correct answer is Every component of the Bloch vector of Z is nonzero. ?"

So it's definitely about Z. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the y-component?

Wait, let me think again.

The trace of σ_y Z is Tr(σ_y Z). Let me compute this using the trace formula which is sum_{i,j} (σ_y)_ij Z_ji ?

Wait another way to compute the trace is sum_{i,j} (σ_y)_{i,j} * Z_{j,i}

Wait, perhaps that's another way. Let me try:

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, for each element:

(σ_y)_{1,1}*Z_{1,1} = 0*(2/3)=0

(σ_y)_{1,2}*Z_{2,1}= (-i)*(1/4)

(σ_y)_{2,1}*Z_{1,2}= (i)*(1/4)

(σ_y)_{2,2}*Z_{2,2}=0*(1/3)=0

Summing these: (-i/4) + (i/4) = 0. So that's the same result.

Hmm. So either the answer is incorrect, or I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the components of the vector being non-zero in magnitude? But zero is zero regardless.

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo in the matrix Z. Let me check again the user's input.

The user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Yes, that's 2/3, 1/4 in first row; 1/4 and 1/3 in second row. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually referring to matrix Y instead of Z? Let me check matrix Y's components.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Bloch vectors for all matrices to see which one has all components non-zero.

First, let's compute for Z again to confirm:

Z's Bloch vector:

x = Tr(σ_x Z) = 1/2,

y = Tr(σ_y Z) = 0,

z = Tr(σ_z Z) = 1/3,

so y is zero. So indeed, the y-component is zero, so the answer that "every component is non-zero" is wrong for Z.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the question? Let me check the other matrices quickly.

Compute for matrix X:

X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So entries:

First row: 1/3, 1

Second row: 1, 2/3

Check if it's Hermitian: the (1,2) entry is 1, and (2,1) entry is 1, so yes, Hermitian.

Trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1, good.

Compute its Bloch components:

x = Tr(σ_x X).

Compute σ_x X:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Multiply by X:

First row first column: 0*(1/3) +1*1 =1

First row second column:0*1 +1*(2/3)=2/3

Second row first column:1*(1/3)+0*1=1/3

Second row second column:1*1 +0*(2/3)=1

So σ_x X is [[1, 2/3], [1/3,1]]

Trace is 1 +1 = 2? Wait, that can't be. Because the trace of σ_x X would be 2, but since σ_x has trace zero, maybe something is wrong here?

Wait, but the trace of σ_x is zero, but when multiplied by another matrix, the trace can be non-zero. Wait, but in the Bloch vector formula, the trace is Tr(σ_i ρ), so that's okay. Wait but let me see, for X, the density matrix, the trace of σ_x X would be:

Wait, but let me recalculate the trace.

The matrix σ_x X is:

Row1: [1, 2/3]

Row2: [1/3, 1]

So the trace is 1 +1 = 2. But since the density matrix has trace 1, and σ_x has trace 0, so trace(σ_x X) = Tr(σ_x X) = Tr(σ_x (X)). Since Tr(AB) = Tr(BA). Let me compute X σ_x.

X is [[1/3,1],[1, 2/3]]

Multiply by σ_x:

X σ_x = [[ (1/3)*0 +1*1, (1/3)*1 +1*0 ],

          [1*0 + (2/3)*1, 1*1 + (2/3)*0 ]]

Wait, hold on:

First row of X times first column of σ_x:

(1/3)(0) + (1)(1) = 1

First row of X times second column of σ_x:

(1/3)(1) + (1)(0) = 1/3

Second row of X times first column of σ_x:

(1)(0) + (2/3)(1) = 2/3

Second row of X times second column of σ_x:

(1)(1) + (2/3)(0) =1

So, X σ_x is [[1, 1/3],[2/3,1]], same as σ_x X. Trace is still 1 + 1 = 2. But since the trace of σ_x X is 2, then x-component is 2? Wait, but the density matrix has trace 1. Wait, but the trace of σ_x is zero, so how come?

Wait, Tr(σ_i ρ) can be up to 2 for pure states, but for a density matrix, the trace is Tr(σ_i ρ) which can range between -1 and 1 for each component. Wait, but 2 is outside that?

Wait, for a density matrix, the components of the Bloch vector are scaled between -1 and 1. Because for a pure state, they are ±1. For mixed states, they are less than or equal to 1 in magnitude. So getting a trace of 2 would imply something's wrong here.

Wait, but let me see the calculation again. The matrix X has entries:

Top left:1/3, top right:1,

Bottom left:1, bottom right:2/3.

So the trace is 1/3 +2/3=1. So that's okay. But when multiplying by σ_x, which has entries [0,1;1,0], the product σ_x X is:

First entry is 0*(1/3) +1*1=1,

First row second entry:0*1 +1*(2/3)=2/3,

Second row first entry:1*(1/3)+0*1=1/3,

Second row second entry:1*1 +0*(2/3)=1.

So, trace is 1 +1=2. Hmm, so that's a trace of 2. So x-component is Tr(σ_x X)=2. But since the density matrix has trace 1, and σ_x has trace zero, the trace is 2? That seems impossible because σ_x has trace zero, so trace(σ_x X)= trace( X σ_x), which can be anything?

Wait, the trace of a product is not necessarily the product of traces. So it's possible for the trace to be 2 even though each matrix has trace 1 and 0.

Wait, but Bloch vector components are defined as Tr(σ_i ρ), so for the x-component, it's Tr(σ_x X)=2. But that would mean that the x-component is 2, which is outside the [-1,1] range, which is impossible for a density matrix?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because for any density matrix ρ, the expectation value ⟨σ_i⟩ must satisfy |⟨σ_i⟩| ≤1, because σ_i is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1. Wait, but let's see for X's case:

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues of X to see if it's a valid density matrix. The determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) -1 = -7/9. Negative determinant, so it's not positive semi-definite. Wait, that's a problem. So X is not a valid density matrix? Because determinant is negative, so at least one eigenvalue is negative.

Wait that's a big mistake. If X has determinant negative, it can't be a valid density matrix. The user must have made a mistake in the definition of X. Wait, let me recalculate:

X's determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) -1 = (2/9 - 9/9) = -7/9. Negative determinant, so it's not positive semi-definite, so X is not a valid density matrix. That's a problem. Then why is the user considering it? Maybe a typo?

Wait, the user wrote:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

So indeed, the determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 -1 = -7/9. Negative. So that's invalid. So the problem might have a typo here.

Alternatively, maybe the off-diagonal entries are not 1 but 1/ something? Let me check again.

The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Hmm, so maybe the X matrix is mistyped. Maybe the off-diagonal terms are smaller? Like 1/3 instead of 1? Or perhaps a different number. But as written, it's invalid.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and I should focus back on Z. Since the problem says the correct answer is about Z, so let me check if the question might have confused another matrix with Z.

Looking at matrix Y:

Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Check if it's a valid density matrix.

First, Hermitian? The (1,2) entry is i/3 and (2,1) is -i/3, which is the conjugate, so yes, Hermitian.

Trace: 1/2 +1/2 = 1, okay.

Determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) = 1/4 - ( (i)^2 )/9 = 1/4 - (-1)/9 = 1/4 +1/9 = (9 +4)/36 =13/36, so positive. So valid.

Compute its Bloch components.

First, x-component: Tr(σ_x Y). Let's compute.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Multiply by Y:

σ_x Y = first row:

0*(1/2) +1*(i/3) = i/3,

0*( -i/3 ) +1*(1/2) =1/2,

Wait, hold on:

First row of σ_x times first column of Y: 0*(1/2) +1*( -i/3 )? Wait, the entries of Y are:

Y = [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3,1/2]]

So first row of Y is [1/2, i/3]

Second row is [ -i/3, 1/2 ]

So, σ_x Y:

First row:

[0*(1/2) +1*(-i/3) , 0*(i/3) +1*(1/2) ]

= [ -i/3, 1/2 ]

Second row:

[1*(1/2) +0*(-i/3), 1*(i/3) +0*(1/2) ]

= [1/2, i/3 ]

Thus, σ_x Y is:

[ -i/3, 1/2 ]

[ 1/2, i/3 ]

Trace: (-i/3 + i/3 ) = 0. So x-component is zero?

Wait, the trace is of σ_x Y is (-i/3 + i/3)=0. Hmm, so x-component is zero? Hmm.

Wait, maybe again using the cyclic property, compute Tr(Y σ_x). Let me see:

Y σ_x is:

First row of Y * σ_x columns:

First row of Y is [1/2, i/3]

Multiply by σ_x:

First column:1/2*0 + (i/3)*1 = i/3

Second column:1/2*1 + (i/3)*0 = 1/2

Second row of Y is [-i/3, 1/2], multiplied by σ_x columns:

First column: (-i/3)*0 +1/2*1 =1/2

Second column: (-i/3)*1 +1/2*0 = -i/3

Thus, Y σ_x is:

[ i/3, 1/2 ]

[1/2, -i/3 ]

Trace is i/3 + (-i)/3 =0. So same result. x-component is zero.

Hmm. So Y's x-component is zero.

Compute y-component Tr(σ_y Y):

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]]

Multiply with Y:

σ_y Y:

First row:

0*1/2 + (-i)*(-i/3) = (-i)^2 /3 = (-1)/3

First row second column:

0*(i/3) + (-i)*(1/2) = -i/2

Second row first column:

i*(1/2) +0*(-i/3) = i/2

Second row second column:

i*(i/3) +0*(1/2) = (i^2)/3 = -1/3

So matrix σ_y Y is:

[ -1/3, -i/2 ]

[ i/2, -1/3 ]

Trace is (-1/3) + (-1/3) = -2/3. So y-component is -2/3, non-zero.

Then z-component Tr(σ_z Y):

σ_z is diag(1,-1) multiplied by Y:

σ_z Y = [1*(1/2), 1*(i/3); -1*(-i/3), -1*(1/2)]

So entries:

First row:1/2, i/3

Second row: i/3, -1/2

Trace: 1/2 + (-1/2)=0. Wait, so z-component is zero?

Hmm, so Y's Bloch vector is (0, -2/3, 0). So only the y-component is non-zero. Not all components.

Hmm.

Now, looking at W:

W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

Check if valid.

Hermitian? Yes, because the (1,2) entry is i/4 and (2,1) is -i/4, conjugate.

Trace is 1/2 +1/2 =1.

Determinant: (1/2)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4) =1/4 - ( (i^2)/16 )=1/4 - (-1/16)= 1/4 +1/16=5/16. Positive. Valid.

Compute its Bloch components.

x-component Tr(σ_x W):

σ_x W:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

Multiply by W:

First row:

0*(1/2) +1*(-i/4)= -i/4,

0*(i/4) +1*(1/2)=1/2.

Second row:

1*(1/2) +0*(-i/4)=1/2,

1*(i/4) +0*(1/2)=i/4.

Matrix σ_x W:

[ -i/4, 1/2 ]

[1/2, i/4 ]

Trace is (-i/4 +i/4)=0. So x-component is zero.

y-component Tr(σ_y W):

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]

Multiply by W:

σ_y W:

First row:

0*(1/2) + (-i)*(-i/4)= (-i)^2 /4= -1/4,

0*(i/4)+ (-i)*(1/2)= -i/2.

Second row:

i*(1/2) +0*(-i/4)=i/2,

i*(i/4) +0*(1/2)=i^2/4= -1/4.

Thus, σ_y W:

[ -1/4, -i/2 ]

[ i/2, -1/4 ]

Trace is (-1/4 -1/4)= -1/2. So y-component is -1/2.

z-component Tr(σ_z W):

σ_z W is diag(1, -1) * W,

so entries:

First row:1/2, i/4,

Second row: -(-i/4)=i/4, -1/2.

Wait, let me compute:

σ_z W = [[1*(1/2),1*(i/4)], [-1*(-i/4), -1*(1/2)]]

= [ [1/2, i/4], [i/4, -1/2] ]

Trace is 1/2 + (-1/2) =0. So z-component is zero.

Therefore, the Bloch vector for W is (0, -1/2,0). Only y-component.

So none of the matrices W, X, Y have all components non-zero except maybe Z?

Wait, but Z's y-component is zero. Wait, unless I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait let me check the determinant of Z again. Z is (2/3,1/4;1/4,1/3). The determinant is (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)^2 = 2/9 -1/16 = (32/144 -9/144)=23/144≈0.16, positive, so valid.

Now, let me recheck the calculation for the y-component for Z again.

σ_y Z:

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

Multiply with Z:

First row first column:0*(2/3) + (-i)*(1/4)= -i/4,

First row second column:0*(1/4)+ (-i)*(1/3)= -i/3,

Second row first column:i*(2/3)+0*(1/4)=2i/3,

Second row second column:i*(1/4)+0*(1/3)=i/4.

Thus, σ_y Z matrix is:

[ -i/4, -i/3 ]

[2i/3, i/4 ]

Trace is (-i/4 +i/4)=0. So y-component is zero.

Hmm. So unless there's a miscalculation here, none of the matrices except maybe X, but X isn't valid. So the question must have an error, or I misread the matrices.

Wait, let me check Z's components again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the vector's components to be non-zero in another sense, like direction? No, the question clearly states "every component".

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the real and imaginary parts? Wait, but the Bloch vector components are real numbers. Because for any Hermitian matrix ρ, Tr(σ_i ρ) is real, since σ_i is Hermitian.

Wait, for σ_x and σ_y, the trace Tr(σ_y Z) is zero, which is real. So yes.

Wait, so in all cases, the only matrix with all components non-zero would be... none, except maybe if there's a miscalculation. Wait, let me check matrix Z's z-component again.

z-component Tr(σ_z Z).

σ_z Z is:

σ_z is diag(1,-1), so:

First entry:1*(2/3)=2/3,

First row second:1*(1/4)=1/4,

Second row first: -1*(1/4)= -1/4,

Second row second: -1*(1/3)= -1/3.

So the matrix is:

[2/3, 1/4

-1/4, -1/3]

Trace: 2/3 + (-1/3) =1/3. So z-component is 1/3.

So components are x=1/2, y=0, z=1/3. So only two components are non-zero. So the answer that every component is non-zero is wrong for Z.

Alternatively, maybe the question's Z matrix is different? Maybe there was a typo in the matrix entries?

Wait the user wrote:

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). Maybe the off-diagonal entries are actually imaginary?

Wait looking
