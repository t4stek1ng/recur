Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total? Why the correct answer is 1720?<|im_end|>

Okay, so Michael loves biking, right? Let me see. The problem says he rode his bike at least 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time, and he did that for four weeks. Then he switched to riding only 2 times a week but went 60 kilometers each time, and that lasted for three weeks. We need to find the total kilometers he did. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial period: four weeks where he rides at least 5 times a week. Wait, the problem says "at least 5 times a week," but does that mean exactly 5 or more? Hmm, since they want an exact answer, maybe they just mean exactly 5 times? Because otherwise, if it's "at least," the total could be higher. But since the answer is given as 1720, maybe we can check with 5 times. Let me note that.

So, first part: 4 weeks, 5 rides each week, 25 km each ride.

Calculating that: 4 weeks * 5 rides/week = 20 rides. Each ride is 25 km, so 20 * 25. Let me compute that. 20 times 25 is 500 km. Wait, 25*20 is 500. Okay, so that's the first four weeks.

Second part: then he decided to ride only 2 times a week, but each time 60 km, for three weeks. So that's 3 weeks * 2 rides/week = 6 rides. Each ride is 60 km, so 6 * 60 = 360 km. 

Adding both parts: 500 + 360 = 860? Wait, but the answer is supposed to be 1720. That's way off. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here. Let me check again.

Wait a second, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Hmm, okay, so "at least 5 times a week" – but "at least" could mean 5 or more. But since they give a specific answer of 1720, maybe the question assumes exactly 5 times a week for the first part. But even so, as I calculated, first part is 4 weeks * 5 rides/week *25 km = 500, second part 3 weeks *2 rides/week *60 km= 360, total 860. But 860 is not 1720. Wait, so maybe I miscalculated?
