cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. the reaction mixture is then acidified, forming product 1.

1 is then treated with an excess of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride, forming product 2. what is the structure of prodcut 2?
Why the correct answer is (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one?<|im_end|>

Okay, let's try to figure out this reaction problem step by step. I might get some parts wrong, so I need to think carefully. The question involves cyclohexanone reacting with LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) at low temperature, then adding benzaldehyde, and after acidification, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with excess diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DETS or DAST) to form product 2. The correct answer is given as (S)-2-((R)-fluoro(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one. I need to understand how that structure comes about.

First, let me recall the reactions involved. LDA is a strong base, typically used in the formation of enolates. When you treat a ketone with a strong base like LDA at low temperature (like -78°C), it should deprotonate the ketone, forming the enolate ion. The position of deprotonation in cyclohexanone would be the α-carbon. Since cyclohexanone has two α-carbons (the one adjacent to the carbonyl on either side of the ring), but usually, the more substituted carbon is favored for deprotonation because of the resonance stabilization. Wait, actually, in cyclohexanone, the α-carbon positions: the ketone is at carbon 1 (if we number it that way), so the α-carbons are 2 and 6. The 2nd carbon is adjacent to the ketone, but the 6th carbon is also adjacent. Hmm, maybe the reactivity here depends on steric factors? Alternatively, maybe the major enolate is the less hindered one. Wait, actually, when you form enolates with LDA, usually the most acidic proton is the one with the least steric hindrance. Since cyclohexanone is a ring, maybe the 2nd carbon is less hindered than the 6th? Wait, actually, in a cyclohexane ring, the protons at the equatorial positions are more acidic because they are more exposed? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully here.

Alternatively, perhaps in cyclohexanone, the enolate can form at either β position, but maybe the reaction with benzaldehyde will proceed via the aldol addition. So after forming the enolate, which is a strong nucleophile, reacting it with benzaldehyde would be an aldol condensation? Since we have an enolate (a carbanion) attacking the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.

Wait, but aldol addition typically requires an enolate attacking a carbonyl, leading to a β-hydroxy ketone or aldehyde. So the reaction between cyclohexanone enolate and benzaldehyde would form a β-hydroxy ketone. Then, when acidified, the β-hydroxy ketone would lose water, leading to an α,β-unsaturated ketone? Wait, that is the Claisen-Schmidt condensation? Wait, maybe more like an aldol condensation followed by dehydration? So perhaps product 1 is a β-keto ester or something else?

Wait, let's clarify step by step:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with LDA at low temp: forms enolate. The enolate is the conjugate base of the ketone. The enolate ion is resonance stabilized. The structure of cyclohexanone enolate would have a negative charge on either the 2nd or 6th carbon (assuming the ketone is at C1). 

2. Then, benzaldehyde is added. Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group (C=O), so the enolate would attack the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. This would be an aldol addition. The enolate (carbanion) attacks the carbonyl, pushing the pi electrons onto the oxygen, forming a new C-C bond between the cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde. The product would be a β-hydroxy ketone. Wait, actually, in aldol addition, the enolate would add to the aldehyde, resulting in a tetrahedral intermediate where the oxygen is still there. Then, perhaps in the presence of aldehyde excess or something? Wait, but when you do aldol addition with an enolate and an aldehyde, you get a β-hydroxy ketone? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition between cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde. The enolate of cyclohexanone would attack the benzaldehyde, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between the cyclohexanone's carbon (the one that was deprotonated) and the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The resulting compound would have a hydroxyl group on the α-carbon (since the enolate's negative charge was on the α-carbon, attacking the aldehyde would form a new bond there, with the aldehyde's oxygen now as a hydroxyl group). So the product would be a β-hydroxy ketone. 

Anyway, let's clarify step by step:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with LDA at low temp: forms enolate. The enolate is the conjugate base of the ketone. The enolate ion is resonance stabilized. The structure of cyclohexanone enolate would have a negative charge on either the 2nd or 6th carbon (assuming the ketone is at C1). 

2. Then, benzaldehyde is added. Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group (C=O), so the enolate would attack the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. This would be an aldol addition. The enolate (carbanion) attacks the carbonyl, pushing the pi electrons onto the oxygen, forming a new C-C bond between the cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde. The product would be a β-hydroxy ketone. Wait, actually, in aldol addition, the enolate would add to the aldehyde, resulting in a tetrahedral intermediate where the oxygen is still there. Then, perhaps in the presence of aldehyde excess or something? Wait, but when you do aldol addition with an enolate and an aldehyde, you get a β-hydroxy ketone? Let me think of the enolate as a carbanion at C2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition between cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde. The enolate of cyclohexanone would attack the benzaldehyde, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between the cyclohexanone's carbon (the one that was deprotonated) and the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde. The resulting compound would have a hydroxyl group on the α-carbon (since the enolate's negative charge was on the α-carbon, attacking the aldehyde would form a new bond there, with the aldehyde's oxygen now as a hydroxyl group). So the product would be a β-hydroxy ketone. 

Therefore, let's clarify step by step:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with LDA at low temp: forms enolate. The enolate is the conjugate base of the ketone. The enolate ion is resonance stabilized. The structure of cyclohexanone enolate would have a negative charge on either the 2nd or 6th carbon (assuming the ketone is at C1).

Then, perhaps in the presence of aldehyde excess or something? Wait, but when you do aldol addition with an enolate and an aldehyde, you get a β-hydroxy ketone? Let me parse that structure again.

Therefore, maybe it's a crossed aldol addition between cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde. The enolate of cyclohexanone would attack the benzaldehyde, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between the cyclohexanone's carbon (the one that was deprotonated) and the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde.
