[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The state given is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what the energy is. The answer is supposed to be an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*hbar², but I need to work through why that is.

First, I recall that for spin systems, the Hamiltonian involving terms like S_i · S_j often relates to the total spin operators. The key here is probably to use the properties of the spin operators and the given state.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of the three basis states where two spins are up and one is down. Each term in the superposition has exactly two up spins and one down, and they are all symmetrized. Since the coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), it's a normalized symmetric state.

I need to apply the Hamiltonian H to this state and see if it just multiplies the state by a constant (which would be the eigenvalue) or if it produces a different state, in which case it's not an eigenfunction, and I have to compute the expectation value.

The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let me recall that S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). However, maybe there's a better way to handle this without expanding all components. 

Alternatively, I remember that S_i · S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2 / 2 - S_i²/2 - S_j²/2. Since each spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ² for each spin. But maybe that's not immediately helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this Hamiltonian in terms of the total spin. For three spins, the total spin operator S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Rearranging, the sum of the S_i·S_j terms is (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2. 

But the Hamiltonian H is A*(sum of S_i·S_j), so substituting from the above, H = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2 ). 

Hmm, but since each individual spin is 1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ². So S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². 

Thus, H can be written as A*( [S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 ). 

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ². 

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute step by step:

Starting with S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Then, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)

Therefore, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)] / 2 

Therefore, H = A*( [S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)] / 2 )

So H is proportional to S_total squared minus the sum of individual spin squares. Since the sum of individual spin squares is a constant (because each spin is fixed at 1/2), then H can be expressed as (A/2) S_total² minus a constant term. 

Therefore, if the given state is an eigenstate of S_total², then it would also be an eigenstate of H, because the other term is just a constant. 

Therefore, to check whether psi is an eigenstate of H, we can check whether it is an eigenstate of S_total². 

Alternatively, if we can compute the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi, then we can find the expectation value of H, and see if it's equal to the same for all the terms, which would imply it's an eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute H psi directly. Since that might be straightforward for a three-spin system.

Let me think of the state psi in terms of the basis states. The state psi is (1/sqrt(3)) times (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). Each term is a product state with two up spins and one down. Since the coefficients are the same, the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. 

Now, the Hamiltonian H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let me consider each term separately. Let me compute each term acting on the state psi, then sum them up.

First, I need to recall how S_i · S_j acts on a product state. Since each S_i is a vector operator (with components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z), then S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). However, acting on a product state, maybe we can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the state is symmetric, maybe we can use the properties of symmetric states and the commutation relations with the Hamiltonian. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the total spin of the state.

Wait, let me think again. Since the state is symmetric under permutation of particles, and it has two up spins and one down, its total spin can be computed. Let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2, 1/2, 1/2, 3/2. Wait, actually, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric combination of two up and one down is part of the S = 1/2 multiplet, perhaps? 

Alternatively, let me think of the state in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me see. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S_total² acting on psi. Let me try that.

But first, let me note that since the state is symmetric, perhaps it lies in a specific total spin subspace. Let's see.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of the three states with two up and one down. Let me see, for three particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric states usually correspond to spin 3/2 or 1/2? Wait, actually, the symmetric state with all up would be spin 3/2. The symmetric states with two up and one down should form part of the S=1/2 multiplet. Because, for example, when you combine three spins 1/2, the symmetric triplet (which would have S=3/2) would have the highest weight state as all up, and symmetric combinations with lower numbers of up spins. Wait, maybe I need to think carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is the singlet of the S=1/2 multiplet? Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total z-component of the spin, S_total_z. Since each term in psi has two up spins and one down, the total z-component is (2*(1/2) - 1/2) = 1/2. Therefore, the total S_z is 1/2 ħ. 

Therefore, if it's an eigenstate of S_total², then its eigenvalue would be s(s+1)ħ², where s is the total spin. Since S_z is 1/2, the possible s values could be 3/2 or 1/2. For s=3/2, the possible m values are ±3/2, ±1/2. Since we have m=1/2, it could be part of the 3/2 multiplet (as the next state down from 3/2), or part of the 1/2 multiplet (the only m=1/2 state). To distinguish, we can compute S_total² on the state.

Alternatively, let's try to compute S_total² psi. Since S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, expanding this gives S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, the S_total² operator includes the terms in the Hamiltonian.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)). 

Therefore, if I can compute S_total² psi, then I can get H psi. 

Alternatively, let's compute H psi directly. Let's see.

First, let's write the Hamiltonian term by term. Let me write H as H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, I can compute each term acting on psi, then add them up.

Let me first compute S1·S2 acting on psi, then S1·S3, then S2·S3, and add them.

First, let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the operator S_i · S_j = (3/4)ħ² if the two spins are in singlet or triplet? Wait, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (3/4)ħ² if they are in the triplet state, and (-1/4)ħ² if in the singlet.

But here, we are dealing with three particles, so the operators S_i · S_j act on each pair, while the third particle is in some state. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to act each term separately on the given state.

Let me first compute S1·S2 acting on psi. Let me write psi as:

psi = 1/√3 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So each term is a product state of the three particles. Let's denote each term as:

Term1 = |↑1↑2↓3⟩,

Term2 = |↑1↓2↑3⟩,

Term3 = |↓1↑2↑3⟩.

So the ket is (Term1 + Term2 + Term3)/√3.

Now, let's compute S1·S2 acting on each term.

First, S1·S2 acts non-trivially on particles 1 and 2, and leaves particle 3 alone. 

Let me recall that for two spins 1/2, the operator S1·S2 can be written as (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2². Since S1² = S2² = 3/4 ħ². 

Alternatively, in the basis of product states, S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me recall that for spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices, S_i = ħ/2 σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Thus, S1 · S2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ1 · σ2). The dot product of Pauli matrices is given by σ · σ' = I (for the same component) plus cross terms. Wait, more precisely, σ · σ' = 3I if the spins are in a triplet, or -I if in a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the singlet state (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2 is (-1/4)ħ², and in the triplet states, it's (3/4)ħ². But here, the terms are in different states.

Let me consider each term separately.

First, compute S1·S2 acting on Term1: Term1 is |↑1↑2↓3⟩. 

The state of spins 1 and 2 in Term1 is |↑1↑2⟩. The S1·S2 operator acting on this state:

Since S1·S2 for the first two spins, so on |↑1↑2⟩:

The total spin of spins 1 and 2 in this state is the triplet state (since both up), so their S1·S2 should give the triplet value. Let me compute:

S1·S2 (|↑↑⟩) = ( (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) ) |↑↑⟩.

Let me compute each component:

Since |↑⟩ is an eigenstate of S^z with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and S^x and S^y will mix the states. 

But let's compute it step by step. Let me use the basis for each spin. For the first two spins:

Let me write |↑1↑2⟩. 

Compute S1^z S2^z |↑1↑2⟩ = ( (ħ/2)(ħ/2) ) |↑1↑2⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑1↑2⟩.

Now, S1^x S2^x |↑1↑2⟩. The operator S1^x on |↑1⟩ gives (ħ/2)(|↓1⟩), similarly S2^x on |↑2⟩ gives (ħ/2)|↓2⟩. So the product is (ħ/2)^2 (|↓1↓2⟩). 

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑1↑2⟩ will also give (ħ/2)^2 |↓1↓2⟩, but multiplied by a factor of (-i)(i) which is -1? Wait, actually, for S^y, the operators have imaginary components. Let me recall the actual matrix elements.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the |↑↑⟩ state is ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / (2ħ²) ?

Wait, let me compute (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2, so rearranged, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2.

For the state |↑↑⟩, S1 + S2 has eigenvalues corresponding to the triplet state. Since |↑↑⟩ is the triplet with m = 1, so the total spin is 1 (in terms of ħ units, so spin 1), so (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = ħ²*(1)(1 + 1)|↑↑⟩ = 2ħ² |↑↑⟩. 

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ (2ħ²|↑↑⟩) - ( (3/4 ħ²)|↑↑⟩ ) - (3/4 ħ² |↑↑⟩ ) ] / 2 

Wait, S1² |↑1⟩ is ( (ħ/2)^2 (S^z + ...) but actually, S² for a spin 1/2 is S(S+1)ħ², so S1² = (3/4)ħ², same for S2². Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ 2ħ² - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² ] / 2 * |↑↑⟩ 

Wait, let me compute step by step:

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1² + 2 S1·S2 + S2²)|↑↑⟩ 

Therefore, 

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = ( (3/4 + 3/4 )ħ² + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑⟩ 

But we know that for the triplet state, (S1 + S2)^2 has eigenvalue 2ħ² (since spin 1, so 1*(1+1)). So,

2ħ² |↑↑⟩ = ( (3/2 ħ² ) + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑⟩ 

Therefore,

2 S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (2ħ² - 3/2 ħ² ) |↑↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ²)|↑↑⟩ 

Thus,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑⟩ 

Wait, that seems different from my initial thought. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me see again. Let's denote that for the triplet state (total spin 1), (S1 + S2)^2 has eigenvalue (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩ 

= [ (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩ 

= [ (2ħ² - 1.5 ħ² ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩ 

= (0.5 ħ² / 2 ) |↑↑⟩ 

Wait, 2 - 1.5 = 0.5, so 0.5 ħ² divided by 2 is 0.25 ħ². So that gives S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/4) ħ² |↑↑⟩? Wait but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, but the expectation value for S1·S2 in the triplet is (3/4)ħ². Hmm, perhaps I messed up the units. Wait, actually, the operator S_i has units of ħ, so S1·S2 has units (ħ)^2. So in the calculation above, S1·S2 would give (1/4)ħ². But the expectation value in the triplet is (3/4)ħ². Wait, now I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in splitting the equation. Let me check again:

Starting from (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + 2 S1·S2 + S2^2

So rearranged, 2 S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2

Therefore,

S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2

Therefore, acting on |↑↑⟩, which is in the triplet:

(S1 + S2)^2 has eigenvalue 2ħ² (since spin 1), S1² = S2² = 3/4 ħ² each.

Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²] / 2 |↑↑⟩ 

= [ (2 - 1.5 ) ħ² ] / 2 |↑↑⟩ 

= (0.5 ħ²)/2 |↑↑⟩ 

= (1/4 ħ²) |↑↑⟩ 

Wait, so this suggests that S1·S2 acting on |↑↑⟩ gives 1/4 ħ² |↑↑⟩. But that contradicts the expectation that in the triplet state, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (3/4)ħ². Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. 

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in units. The actual operator S·S is (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2². But when we write S_i in terms of the spin operators, the S_i here is in units of ħ. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the units. Let me define S_i as the operator with eigenvalues s(s+1), so S² = ħ² s(s+1). Therefore, perhaps the actual expression is:

S_i · S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ) / (2ħ²) * ħ^4 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the dimensionless form. Let me denote the operators without ħ for simplicity, so S_i^2 = s(s+1) in units where ħ=1. Then,

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2,

so S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ] / 2.

So, in the |↑↑⟩ state (which is a spin-1 state), S1 + S2 has eigenvalue 1*(1+1) = 2, so (S1 + S2)^2 = 2. Then S1² = S2² = 3/4 (since spin 1/2). Therefore,

S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 1/4. 

So in units where ħ=1, the eigenvalue is 1/4. But if we include ħ², then the actual value is (1/4)ħ^4? Wait no, the operator S1·S2 when written in terms of the dimensionless operators would have eigenvalues like 3/4, etc. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises here.

Let me clarify: Let me define the spin operators in terms of matrices. For spin 1/2, the Pauli matrices σ_i have eigenvalues ±1. The actual spin operator S_i is (ħ/2) σ_i, so S_i^2 = (ħ^2 /4) σ_i^2 = (ħ^2 /4)(3/2) ?

Wait, σ_i^2 = I (the identity matrix). Wait, actually σ_x^2 = σ_y^2 = σ_z^2 = I. So S_i^2 = (ħ/2)^2 σ_i^2 = (ħ² /4) I.

Therefore, S_i² gives (ħ² /4) for each component. Wait no, actually S_i² = (S_{xi}^2 + S_{yi}^2 + S_{zi}^2) ?

Wait, no, S_i² is the square of the vector operator, so (S_i)^2 = S_{xi}^2 + S_{yi}^2 + S_{zi}^2. For spin 1/2, each component squared is (ħ/2)^2 * σ², so:

(S_i)^2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z²) = (ħ/2)^2 (3 I) = (3ħ² /4) I.

Therefore, S_i^2 |any state⟩ = (3ħ²/4)|any state⟩. 

So when we compute S1·S2 acting on |↑↑⟩, using the previous equation:

S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ] / 2.

So plugging in,

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = ( (1)(1+1)ħ² ) |↑↑⟩ = 2ħ² |↑↑⟩,

and S1² |↑↑⟩ = (3ħ² /4)|↑↑⟩,

same for S2². Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = ( 2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 ) / 2 |↑↑⟩ 

= (2ħ² - 1.5ħ²)/2 |↑↑⟩ 

= (0.5ħ²)/2 |↑↑⟩ 

= 0.25ħ² |↑↑⟩. 

Therefore, the eigenvalue is 0.25ħ²? But the expectation value in the triplet is supposed to be 3/4 ħ². Wait, this is confusing. Wait, if the expectation value of S1·S2 in the |↑↑⟩ state is (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩ divided by |↑↑⟩, so it's 0.25ħ². But if the triplet state is |↑↑⟩, then why is that?

Wait, maybe the confusion is between the eigenvalue and the expectation value. Wait, no—here, the operator S1·S2 acts on the state |↑↑⟩, giving an eigenvalue of 0.25ħ²? That contradicts what I thought earlier, that the triplet has S1·S2 with eigenvalue 3/4 ħ². Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. 

Wait, let me compute S1·S2 in the triplet states. The triplet states are:

|↑↑⟩,

( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2),

|↓↓⟩,

and for the singlet it's (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but in the singlet, the eigenvalue of S1·S2 is -1/4 ħ². In the triplet, for the |↑↑⟩, as above, gives 0.25 ħ². Wait, but the triplet has total spin 1, so (S1 + S2)^2 = 2ħ², so (S1·S2) would then be (2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 ) / 2 = 0.25ħ², so that's correct. 

Wait, but the triplet states have different eigenvalues for S1·S2. Wait, actually, the triplet states have different eigenvalues?

Wait, no, the operator S1·S2 should have the same eigenvalue for all triplet states? Because they are in the same total spin state? Wait, perhaps not. Let me check for another triplet state, say ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ )/sqrt(2). Let me compute S1·S2 on that.

Let me denote |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ as states.

Compute S1·S2 on |↑↓⟩:

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = ( (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ) |↑↓⟩ )

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ/2)^2 (-1/2) ) |↑↓⟩ 

Wait, more precisely:

The z-component terms: S1^z |↑⟩ is (ħ/2)|↑⟩, and S2^z |↓⟩ is (-ħ/2)|↓⟩. So S1^z S2^z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|↑↓⟩ = -ħ²/4 |↑↓⟩.

Now, S1^x S2^x |↑↓⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(|↓⟩),

S2^x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

so the product is (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↓⟩:

S1^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩,

S2^y |↓⟩ = (-iħ/2)|↑⟩,

so S1^y S2^y |↑↓⟩ = (iħ/2)(-iħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ (since i*(-i)=1).

Therefore, adding all three terms:

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)|↑↓⟩ 

= [ (ħ²/4)(|↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩) - ħ²/4 |↑↓⟩ ]

Wait, wait:

Wait S1^x S2^x gives |↓↑⟩,

S1^y S2^y also gives |↓↑⟩,

and S1^z S2^z gives - |↑↓⟩.

Therefore,

Total: (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (-ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ 

= ( ħ²/2 |↓↑⟩ - ħ²/4 |↑↓⟩ )

Hmm, so the total S1·S2 acting on |↑↓⟩ is a combination of |↓↑⟩ and |↑↓⟩. Therefore, it's not an eigenstate. Wait, but the triplet states are eigenstates of S_total^2 and S_z. But S1·S2 doesn't commute with S_total^2? Wait, actually, S1·S2 is part of the Hamiltonian, which might not commute with S_total^2 unless the Hamiltonian is proportional to it. Wait, but S_total² is a Casimir, so it commutes with all the components of S_total, but not necessarily with the individual S_i·S_j terms. Hmm, this is getting a bit too deep. Let's get back.

Wait, since we're trying to compute H psi, perhaps going back to the original state.

So, in any case, perhaps it's better to compute H acting on each term of psi and see.

Let me recall that psi is (Term1 + Term2 + Term3)/sqrt(3).

First, compute H acting on Term1 = |↑↑↓⟩:

H = A*( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩. As above, on the first two spins (↑↑), S1·S2 gives (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ (from previous calculation). 

Second term: S1·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩. Here, the third spin is down. The first spin is up. Let's compute S1·S3 on |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S1 and S3 are the first and third particles. The state is |↑1↑2↓3⟩. So S1 acts on the first particle, S3 on the third.

So S1·S3 = (S1^x S3^x + S1^y S3^y + S1^z S3^z )

Acting on |↑1↑2↓3⟩, let's compute each component:

First, S1^z S3^z |↑1↑2↓3⟩ = ( (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) ) |↑1↑2↓3⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↑1↑2↓3⟩.

Similarly, S1^x S3^x |↑1↑2↓3⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩,

S3^x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

so the product gives (ħ/2)^2 |↓1↑2↑3⟩.

Similarly, S1^y S3^y |↑1↑2↓3⟩:

S1^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩,

S3^y |↓⟩ = (-iħ/2)|↑⟩,

so the product is (iħ/2)(-iħ/2)|↓1↑2↑3⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓1↑2↑3⟩.

Therefore, S1·S3 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ is:

[ ħ²/4 |↓1↑2↑3⟩ + ħ²/4 |↓1↑2↑3⟩ - ħ²/4 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ ]

= [ ħ²/2 |↓1↑2↑3⟩ - ħ²/4 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ ]

Similarly, the third term S2·S3 acting on |↑1↑2↓3⟩:

S2 acts on the second spin, S3 on the third spin.

The state is |↑1↑2↓3⟩.

So S2·S3 = (S2^x S3^x + S2^y S3^y + S2^z S3^z )

Compute each term:

S2^z S3^z gives ( (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) ) |↑1↑2↓3⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↑1↑2↓3⟩.

S2^x S3^x |↑1↑2↓3⟩:

S2^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩,

S3^x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

so the product is (ħ/2)^2 |↑1↓2↑3⟩.

Similarly S2^y S3^y:

S2^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩,

S3^y |↓⟩ = (-iħ/2)|↑⟩,

so product is (iħ/2)(-iħ/2)|↑1↓2↑3⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑1↓2↑3⟩.

Thus, adding these,

S2·S3 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ = [ ħ²/4 |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + ħ²/4 |↑1↓2↑3⟩ - ħ²/4 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ ]

= [ ħ²/2 |↑1↓2↑3⟩ - ħ²/4 |↑1↑2↓3⟩ ]

Therefore, putting all three terms together for H acting on Term1:

H Term1 = A*( S1·S2 Term1 + S1·S3 Term1 + S2·S3 Term1 )

First term: S1·S2 Term1 = (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩. Wait, actually, in the previous calculation for S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩, since the third spin is unaffected, the total result is (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩ + terms from other operators? Wait no, actually earlier I computed S1·S2 acting on the first two spins gives 1/4 ħ² times |↑↑↓⟩, because the third spin is just along for the ride. Wait, actually yes. Because when we computed S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩, that part gives (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑⟩, so when considering the third spin (down in Term1), the total effect is (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, wait my mistake: in the earlier calculation, when I computed S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩, I was considering only two spins. Here, the third spin is in a product state, so S1·S2 acting on the three-particle state |↑↑↓⟩ is indeed (S1·S2)(|↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩) = (S1·S2|↑↑⟩) ⊗ |↓⟩ = (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, that's much simpler! So because S1·S2 acts only on the first two particles, and leaves the third untouched, so the result is indeed (1/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩. Similarly, the other terms:

S1·S3 acting on Term1 gives the
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). If it is, I have to find its energy, and if not, compute the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*ħ². Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's recall that each S_i represents the spin operator for particle i. Since the particles are spin 1/2, each S_i has components S_i_x, S_i_y, S_i_z, and the dot product S_i·S_j would be the sum of the products of their components: S_i_x S_j_x + S_i_y S_j_y + S_i_z S_j_z.

The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3) times the sum of three terms: up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3. So, each term has exactly two spins up and one down. The coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), so it's symmetric in some way.

I need to check if this state is an eigenstate of H. To do that, I can apply the Hamiltonian to the state and see if it results in a scalar multiple of the state.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by looking at the symmetry of the state and the operators involved. Let me think first about the properties of the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is symmetric in all three particles, since each term is a product of two spin operators and each pair (1-2, 1-3, 2-3) is included. So H is a symmetric operator.

The given state psi is symmetric under certain permutations. Let me check the permutation symmetry of psi. If we swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2*up1*down3, which is the same as the original term since the spins are swapped but the state is the same (since the spins are both up). Similarly, the second term becomes up2*down1*up3, which is the same as the third term (down1*up2*up3) except for the order in the tensor product. Since tensor products are ordered, swapping the first two particles would turn the second term into the third term, and the third term into the second term. Wait, actually, the terms are:

Term1: up1 up2 down3

Term2: up1 down2 up3

Term3: down1 up2 up3

So swapping particles 1 and 2:

Term1 becomes up2 up1 down3, which is same as original term1 because the first two spins are both up, so order doesn't matter? Wait, no, tensor products are ordered. So up1 up2 down3 is different from up2 up1 down3? Wait, actually, no, because the tensor product is ordered. The first ket is particle 1, then 2, then 3. So up1 up2 down3 is particle1 up, particle2 up, particle3 down. If you swap 1 and 2, you get particle1 up, particle2 up, particle3 down? Wait, no. Wait swapping 1 and 2 would mean particle1 becomes particle2's original state, and vice versa.

Wait, let me clarify:

Original term1: particle1 up, particle2 up, particle3 down.

After swapping 1 and 2: particle1 (originally particle2) up, particle2 (originally particle1) up, particle3 down. So it's still up1_up2_down3. So it's the same term.

Wait, actually, yes, because the first two particles are both up. So swapping them doesn't change the term. Similarly, term2: up1 down2 up3. Swapping 1 and 2 gives down1 up2 up3, which is term3. Term3: down1 up2 up3, swapping 1 and 2 gives up1 down2 up3, which is term2. So overall, swapping 1 and 2 takes term2 <-> term3 and leaves term1 unchanged. Therefore the total state after swapping 1 and 2 would be (term1 + term3 + term2)/sqrt(3), which is the same as the original state. So the state is symmetric under swapping particles 1 and 2. Similarly, if we swap particles 1 and 3, let's see:

Term1: up1 up2 down3. Swapping 1 and 3 gives down3 up2 up1. But the order is particle1 becomes down, particle2 remains up, particle3 becomes up1? Wait, no, the labels are important. Let me think again:

After swapping 1 and 3, term1 becomes down1 up2 up3 (since the first entry (particle1) was originally particle3's down, and particle3 becomes particle1's original up, but actually confusion here. Wait, perhaps it's better to write them as |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

Term1: |↑↑↓⟩ (particles 1,2,3)

After swapping 1 and 3, it becomes |↓↑↑⟩. Similarly, term2: |↑↓↑⟩ becomes |↑↑↓⟩ when swapping 1 and 3? Wait no:

Wait term2 is |↑↓↑⟩ for particles 1,2,3. Swapping 1 and 3 would make it |↑↓↑⟩ becomes |↑↓↑⟩ with particles 1 and 3 swapped? Wait no:

Wait, particle1 and particle3 are swapped, so the first component (particle1) becomes the third component's original state (up), the third component (particle3) becomes the first's (up), but the second stays. Wait:

Original term2: |↑ (1), ↓ (2), ↑ (3)⟩

After swapping 1 and 3: |↑ (3) → first particle is third's original, which was up; second stays down; third becomes first's original up → so the new state is |↑ (1), ↓ (2), ↑ (3)⟩? Wait, no. Wait actually:

Wait, the first ket is for particle1, the second for 2, third for 3.

After swapping 1 and 3, the new first ket is original third, new second is same, new third is original first. So term2 becomes |↑ (from original third) , ↓ (still second), ↑ (from original first)⟩. Wait original term2 had particle3 up, so after swap, particle1 is up (from original third), particle2 stays down, particle3 is up (from original first). So the new state is |↑ (1), ↓ (2), ↑ (3)⟩, same as original term2? Wait, no, original third was up, so swapping 1 and 3 would make first ket (particle1) become up (from original third's up), the same as original third? Wait original term2 is |↑ (1), ↓ (2), ↑ (3)⟩. After swapping 1 and 3, it becomes |↑ (3 was up), ↓ (2), ↑ (1 was up)⟩ → which is |↑ (1), ↓ (2), ↑ (3)⟩, same as original. Wait that can't be.

Wait, no. Wait the original third particle in term2 was up, so when swapping 1 and 3, the first particle becomes the third's state (up), and the third becomes the first's state (up). So the first and third particles are still up, while the second is down. So the state remains the same as term2. Wait, but term3 is |↓↑↑⟩. Let me check term3:

Term3 is |↓ (1), ↑ (2), ↑ (3)⟩. Swapping 1 and 3 gives |↑ (3), ↑ (2), ↓ (1)⟩, which is |↑, ↑, ↓⟩, which is term1. So term3 swaps to term1. So swapping 1 and 3, the state becomes:

Original terms: term1 + term2 + term3.

After swapping 1 and 3: term1 swaps with term3, term2 stays. So the new state is term3 + term2 + term1, which is the same as original. Therefore, the state is symmetric under swapping 1 and 3 as well. Similarly, swapping 2 and 3 should also leave it invariant. Let me check:

Term1: |↑↑↓⟩. Swapping 2 and 3: |↑↓↑⟩, which is term2.

Term2: |↑↓↑⟩. Swapping 2 and3: |↑↑↓⟩, which is term1.

Term3: |↓↑↑⟩. Swapping 2 and3: |↓↑↑⟩ (since the second and third components are both up). So swapping 2 and3 leaves term3 unchanged.

Therefore, swapping 2 and3 would turn term1 into term2, term2 into term1, and term3 stays. So the total state becomes term2 + term1 + term3, which is the same as original. So the state is fully symmetric under all permutations of the three particles. Therefore, it is a totally symmetric state.

The Hamiltonian is also symmetric under permutation of the particles, so when acting on a totally symmetric state, the Hamiltonian might also produce a multiple of that state.

Therefore, maybe this state is an eigenstate of H. Let me try to compute H psi.

Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of angular momentum addition.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, perhaps we can think of it as a triplet state or something, but since it's three particles, things get more complicated.

Alternatively, compute H psi directly. Let me try that.

First, note that S_i · S_j = (S_i_x S_j_x + S_i_y S_j_y + S_i_z S_j_z). So for each pair, we can write their dot product, then sum over all pairs. Then multiply by A.

But since the state is a linear combination of three basis states, each with two spins up and one down, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value by calculating H acting on each term and then combining the results.

Alternatively, let me note that each S_i · S_j can be written as ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ) / 2. Since S_i² for a spin 1/2 is (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². Therefore, S_i · S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ² ] / 2.

Therefore, H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃) = A/2 [ (S₁+S₂)^2 + (S₁+S₃)^2 + (S₂+S₃)^2 - 3*3/2 ħ² ]

Wait, let me do this step by step:

Each term S_i · S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ] / 2

Thus, S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ = [ (S₁+S₂)^2 - S₁² - S₂² + (S₁+S₃)^2 - S₁² - S₃² + (S₂+S₃)^2 - S₂² - S₃² ] / 2

Combine terms:

Let me compute numerator:

= ( (S₁+S₂)^2 + (S₁+S₃)^2 + (S₂+S₃)^2 ) - [ S₁² + S₂² + S₁² + S₃² + S₂² + S₃² ] all divided by 2.

So simplifying the terms inside the brackets:

First part: (S₁+S₂)^2 + (S₁+S₃)^2 + (S₂+S₃)^2

Second part: 2S₁² + 2S₂² + 2S₃²

Therefore, the entire expression becomes [ (sum of squares of the pair sums) - 2(S₁² + S₂² + S₃²) ] / 2.

Hence,

H = A/2 [ (sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 ) - 2(S₁² + S₂² + S₃²) ] / 1 ?

Wait, wait, actually:

Wait, the original expression:

The numerator was (sum of (S_i + S_j)^2 terms) - 2*(sum of S_i squared terms). Then dividing by 2. So:

H = A*( [ (sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 ) - 2*(S₁² + S₂² + S₃²) ] ) / 2.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, note that for each pair, S_i · S_j is proportional to the square of their total spin. But given that the particles are spin 1/2, when adding two spins, we can get total spin 0 or 1, so their S² would be (0)(1)ħ² or (1)(2)ħ². Hmm, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value of H in the given state.

Let me denote the state psi as ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3).

Let me compute ⟨psi | H | psi⟩, since if it is an eigenstate, this would be the eigenvalue, otherwise it's the expectation value. The question is whether H psi equals something times psi.

Alternatively, compute H psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

First, let's compute H psi. H is A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). Let me compute each term separately.

Note that S_i · S_j acts on the state by acting on the i-th and j-th particles.

First, let's compute S₁·S₂ psi.

Since S₁·S₂ only acts on particles 1 and 2, so the third particle is unaffected. Similarly for the other terms.

Let me compute S₁·S₂ acting on each of the three terms in psi.

First term: |↑↑↓⟩

S₁·S₂ acts on first two particles. Let's compute S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ first (since third is down, but it stays).

For two spin 1/2 particles in |↑↑⟩:

S₁·S₂ = (S₁_x S₂_x + S₁_y S₂_y + S₁_z S₂_z ) |↑↑⟩

We know that for two spin 1/2 particles, S₁·S₂ = 3/4 ħ² when in a triplet state (which |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet), or -1/4 ħ² if in singlet. Since |↑↑⟩ is triplet, so S₁·S₂ = 3/4 ħ² times the same state. Wait, but actually, let me compute it explicitly.

Alternatively, since for any two spins, the expectation value of S₁·S₂ in |↑↑⟩ is:

⟨↑↑| S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (S₁·S₂) |↑↑⟩ ?

Wait actually S₁·S₂ is an operator, so applying it to |↑↑⟩ would give (S₁·S₂) |↑↑⟩. Let me recall that S_z for the first spin is ħ/2 |↑⟩⟨↑| - ħ/2 |↓⟩⟨↓|, similarly for the second. So S₁_z S₂_z |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑⟩. Similarly, S₁_x S₂_x and S₁_y S₂_y would involve terms that mix the states.

Alternatively, perhaps use the eigenvalues. Since |↑↑⟩ is an eigenstate of S_total^2 where S_total = S₁ + S₂. For two spins 1/2, the triplet state (total spin 1) has S_total^2 = 1*(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². The dot product S₁·S₂ is (S_total² - S₁² - S₂²)/2. Since S₁² = S₂² = 3/4 ħ² each, so:

S₁·S₂ = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 3/2)/2 ħ² = (1/2)/2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ². Wait but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait let me recast:

The formula S_i · S_j = (S_total² - S_i² - S_j²)/2. So yes, for the two particles 1 and 2:

(S₁ + S₂)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + 2 S₁·S₂. Therefore,

S₁·S₂ = [ (S₁ + S₂)^2 - S₁² - S₂² ] / 2.

So if the state is in a triplet (total spin 1), then (S₁ + S₂)^2 = (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ², so S₁·S₂ = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5/2 = 0.25 ħ². Wait so actually S₁·S₂ is 1/4 ħ² for the |↑↑⟩ state?

Hmm, but if I compute the matrix elements:

Let me write S_x, S_y, S_z in terms of Pauli matrices.

Let me take the basis for two spins |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩.

The operator S₁·S₂ in this basis:

Each component:

S₁_x S₂_x = (σ₁_x / 2) (σ₂_x / 2) = (σ_x ⊗ σ_x)/4.

Similarly for S₁_y S₂_y and S₁_z S₂_z.

The total S₁·S₂ is (σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z)/4.

The sum of these terms is (σ·σ)/4 where σ·σ = 3 for the identity matrix? Wait, actually the identity term?

Wait, the trace of σ_i⊗σ_i for i=x,y,z summed over i:

Wait, actually, the identity term comes from the following:

The Pauli matrices satisfy σ_i · σ_j = δ_ij I + iε_{ijk} σ_k, but when summed over i, maybe?

Alternatively, the sum σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z = 2 I (for each particle? Wait wait, actually, for two spins, the sum is equal to 2*(I⊗I) + ... Hmm, perhaps better to compute explicitly.

The operator S₁·S₂ is (σ₁·σ₂)/4 where σ₁ and σ₂ are Pauli matrices for each spin. The Pauli matrices satisfy σ₁·σ₂ = I⊗I + 2 S₁·S₂, but perhaps this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, let me write S₁·S₂ in terms of the basis states:

Let me consider the matrix element ⟨↑↑| S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩.

We can compute each component:

S_z₁ S_z₂ |↑↑⟩ = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| - ħ/2 |↓⟩⟨↓| )_1 ⊗ (same for 2) acting on |↑↑⟩.

So S_z₁ S_z₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩

S_x₁ S_x₂: The x component for each spin is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/2. So S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩ = ( (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/2 )_1 ⊗ (same for 2) acting on |↑↑⟩.

Compute:

First, (|↑⟩⟨↓|)_1 applied to |↑⟩ gives ⟨↓|↑⟩ |↑⟩ = 0, so the first term is zero. The |↓⟩⟨↑| term on the first spin gives |↓⟩⟨↑| first, so:

Wait, actually, S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩ = (σ₁_x/2)(σ₂_x/2)|↑↑⟩.

σ_x acting on the first spin |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, so σ₁_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, then σ₂_x acting on |↑⟩ is also |↓⟩, so overall:

σ₁_x σ₂_x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩, so S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)^2 |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S_y₁ S_y₂ will do the same but with a phase: since σ_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, so (σ₁_y σ₂_y)|↑↑⟩ = (i)^2 |↓↓⟩ = -|↓↓⟩, so S_y₁ S_y₂ |↑↑⟩ = - (1/2)^2 |↓↓⟩.

Therefore, S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = [ (1/4)(|↓↓⟩) - (1/4)(|↓↓⟩) + (1/4)|↑↑⟩ (from S_z term?) Wait, no.

Wait I think I need to re-examine:

The total S₁·S₂ is the sum of S_x₁ S_x₂ + S_y₁ S_y₂ + S_z₁ S_z₂.

We have S_z₁ S_z₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑⟩.

Then S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩ = (σ_x/2 ⊗ σ_x/2)|↑↑⟩ = ( (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓|)/2 ⊗ similar terms ) acting on |↑↑⟩.

Wait maybe my earlier calculation was oversimplified.

Wait actually, let me do this step by step:

First, let's compute each term:

First term: S_z₁ S_z₂ |↑↑⟩:

S_z₁ acts on first spin, S_z₂ on second:

(S_z₁ S_z₂)|↑↑⟩ = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| - ħ/2 |↓⟩⟨↓| ) ⊗ same for second spin acting on |↑↑⟩.

So the result is (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑⟩ since both project to |↑⟩.

Second term: S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩:

Expressed in terms of Pauli matrices: σ_x/2 ⊗ σ_x/2.

Each σ_x flips the spin, so:

σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

So S_x₁ S_x₂ |↑↑⟩ = ( (σ_x/2 ⊗ σ_x/2 ) |↑↑⟩ ) = (1/2)^2 |↓↓⟩.

Third term: S_y₁ S_y₂ |↑↑⟩:

σ_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, so σ_y ⊗ σ_y |↑↑⟩ = (i)^2 |↓↓⟩ = -|↓↓⟩.

Thus S_y₁ S_y₂ |↑↑⟩ = (σ_y/2 ⊗ σ_y/2)|↑↑⟩ = - (1/2)^2 |↓↓⟩.

Therefore, adding all components:

S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = [ ( (1/2)^2 ) (|↓↓⟩) + ( - (1/2)^2 ) |↓↓⟩ + ( (ħ/2)^2 ) |↑↑⟩ ].

Wait, hold on, no, actually each term is scaled by the components:

Wait, the total operator is (σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z)/4.

Wait, so S₁·S₂ = (σ₁·σ₂)/4, where σ₁·σ₂ = σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z.

Therefore, S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = [ (σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z ) /4 ] |↑↑⟩.

So compute each term:

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↑⟩ = -|↓↓⟩,

So adding them:

[ |↑↑⟩ + |↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ ] /4 = |↑↑⟩ /4.

Therefore S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑⟩.

Wait, so indeed the result is (1/4)|↑↑⟩. So the expectation value of S₁·S₂ in the state |↑↑⟩ is 1/4 ħ²? Wait, since the operator S₁·S₂ is (σ·σ)/4, but the actual operator must have units of (ħ)^2, so in terms of ħ², the coefficient is 1/4. Therefore, S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑⟩ in units of ħ². So the eigenvalue here is 1/4 ħ².

Wait, but the total S₁·S₂ in this case gives back the same state multiplied by 1/4 ħ². So that term is okay.

Now going back to the first term in psi: |↑↑↓⟩.

So when we apply S₁·S₂ to |↑↑↓⟩, since the third particle is unaffected, we get 1/4 |↑↑↓⟩ (from the first two spins) multiplied by ħ². Similarly, when applying S₁·S₂ to the second term, |↑↓↑⟩, we need to see what S₁·S₂ does here. Let's compute S₁·S₂ on the second term.

Second term in psi: |↑↓↑⟩. Applying S₁·S₂ (acting on first and second spins):

First, the state of the first two spins is |↑↓⟩. The third spin is up, but it's unaffected.

Compute S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩:

Using the same method as above, perhaps?

Let me compute S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩.

For the two spins in state |↑↓⟩, let's use the same approach.

Expressed in terms of Pauli matrices:

σ₁·σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ + σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ + σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩.

Compute each term:

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↑|⊗ |↓⟩⟨↓| - |↓⟩⟨↓|⊗ |↑⟩⟨↑| + ...) Wait, just compute:

σ_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, so σ_z⊗σ_z on |↑↓⟩ is ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ ) ⊗ ( (-ħ/2)|↓⟩ ) ?

Wait no, actually, more precisely:

σ_z⊗σ_z acting on |↑↓⟩ is (σ_z |↑⟩) ⊗ (σ_z |↓⟩) = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ ) ⊗ ( (-ħ/2)|↓⟩ ). So the result is - (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

Wait, but actually, σ_z⊗σ_z applied to |↑↓⟩ is (σ_z on first spin) * (σ_z on second spin) |↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| ) |↑⟩ ⊗ ( (-ħ/2)|↓⟩⟨↓| ) |↓⟩ ) = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ ) ⊗ ( (-ħ/2)|↓⟩ ). So the result is - (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

Wait, but in the operator S₁·S₂, we need to include the coefficients properly. Wait, actually the operator S₁·S₂ is (σ₁·σ₂)/4, so each term is divided by 4.

So σ_z⊗σ_z term gives - (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓⟩, so divided by 4, that's - (ħ² / 16) |↑↓⟩? Wait no, perhaps confusion between operator and its action.

Wait, no. Let me do it similarly to the previous case.

First, compute σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩:

σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩⊗|↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩: σ_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩, so σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ = (i|↓⟩) ⊗ (-i|↑⟩ ) = -i² |↓↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| - (ħ/2)|↓⟩⟨↓| ) on first, same for second.

Wait, but let me just compute the matrix:

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩: first component σ_z|↑⟩ is (ħ/2)|↑⟩, second is σ_z|↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, so overall (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|↑↓⟩ = - (ħ² /4)|↑↓⟩.

Wait, so:

σ_x⊗σ_x term gives |↓↑⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y gives |↓↑⟩,

σ_z⊗σ_z gives - |↑↓⟩ (times ħ²/4? Wait, no, the operator is (σ₁·σ₂)/4, so:

σ₁·σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = ( σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z ) |↑↓⟩.

So:

σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = -|↑↓⟩ (without the ħ terms yet).

Thus, adding them:

( |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ ), then multiplied by the operator's 1/4.

Wait the σ·σ operator is just the sum, so in terms of matrices, but in units, perhaps:

Wait the actual operator S₁·S₂ is (σ₁·σ₂)/4, where the Pauli matrices are in units of ħ/2. Wait, hold on, perhaps there's confusion between the Pauli matrices and the spin operators.

Wait, actually, the spin operators S_i are (ħ/2)σ_i, so S₁·S₂ = ( (ħ/2)^2 (σ₁·σ₂) ). So the total operator is (ħ²/4) (σ₁·σ₂). Therefore, the actual computation needs to include that.

So in terms of the previous computation:

σ₁·σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = (σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z ) |↑↓⟩ = ( |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ ). So that's (2|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩).

Therefore, S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4) (2|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩).

Thus, applying S₁·S₂ to the second term of psi: |↑↓↑⟩ (particles 1:↑, 2:↓, 3:↑):

The S₁·S₂ acts only on particles 1 and 2, so the third particle remains ↑. Therefore,

S₁·S₂ |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩_3 = (ħ²/4)(2|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩).

Similarly, moving on to the third term in psi: |↓↑↑⟩.

Applying S₁·S₂ to this term affects particles 1 and 2, which are |↓↑⟩.

Let's compute S₁·S₂ |↓↑⟩ for the first two spins:

We can note that |↓↑⟩ is just |↑↓⟩ with particles swapped, so due to the symmetry of the operator, it should be similar.

Compute σ₁·σ₂ |↓↑⟩:

σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩,

σ_z⊗σ_z |↓↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩*(-ħ/2)^2? Wait let's do it again step by step.

σ_z⊗σ_z acting on |↓↑⟩:

σ_z |↓⟩ = -ħ/2 |↓⟩,

σ_z |↑⟩ = +ħ/2 |↑⟩,

so σ_z⊗σ_z |↓↑⟩ = (-ħ/2)(+ħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = - (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ = σ_x |↓⟩ ⊗ σ_x |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = (iσ_y |↓⟩ ) ⊗ ( -i σ_y |↑⟩ ). Wait, σ_y |↓⟩ = i |↑⟩,

σ_y |↑⟩ = -i |↓⟩,

so σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = (i |↑⟩) ⊗ ( -i |↓⟩ ) = (-i²)|↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, σ₁·σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = ( σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z ) |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + ( -|↓↑⟩ ) (since σ_z term gives -|↓↑⟩).

Wait σ_z term was - (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩, but in the operator expression, the σ_z⊗σ_z term coefficient is -1 when considering the normalization? Wait, no, in terms of operators without units:

The total σ₁·σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) = 2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩.

So S₁·S₂ |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩).

Therefore, applying S₁·S₂ to |↓↑↑⟩ (third term):

particles 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩, so S₁·S₂ |↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) ⊗ |↑⟩_3 = (ħ²/4)(2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩).

Okay, so now we've computed S₁·S₂ acting on each term of psi.

Therefore, putting it all together, S₁·S₂ psi is:

First term contribution:

S₁·S₂ on |↑↑↓⟩ gives (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩,

Second term contribution: S₁·S₂ on |↑↓↑⟩ gives (ħ²/4)(2|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩),

Third term contribution: S₁·S₂ on |↓↑↑⟩ gives (ħ²/4)(2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩).

Adding these up, multiply each by 1/√3 (since psi has coefficient 1/√3), but actually, let's compute the total effect:

Wait actually, S₁·S₂ acts on psi, so compute:

S₁·S₂ psi = (1/√3)[ S₁·S₂ |↑↑↓⟩ + S₁·S₂ |↑↓↑⟩ + S₁·S₂ |
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). If it is, then I have to find its energy, and if not, calculate the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)Aħ². Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the state ψ is given as (1/√3)(|↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩). So it's a symmetric combination of three basis states where exactly two particles are spin-up and one is spin-down. The coefficients of each term are equal, and normalized since the total is divided by √3.

The Hamiltonian involves the dot products of the spin operators between each pair of particles. The spin operators for spin-1/2 particles can be represented by Pauli matrices. The dot product S_i·S_j is (S_i_x S_j_x + S_i_y S_j_y + S_i_z S_j_z). Since these are operators, we have to apply them to the state ψ and see what happens.

But maybe there's a smarter way instead of brute-forcing through all the terms. Let's recall that for spin systems, the total spin operators are often useful. The total spin squared operator is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, but here the Hamiltonian is not S², it's a combination of the pairwise dot products. Let me see if there's a relation between these terms and the total spin operators.

Wait, actually, expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 gives S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is part of the Hamiltonian, maybe we can express it in terms of S² and the individual spins.

But since each particle is spin-1/2, the individual S_i² for each particle is (ħ²)( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, the sum S1² + S2² + S3² is 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². Hence, we can write:

S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(H/A) because H/A is exactly S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. Therefore, rearranged, we have H/A = (S² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2. So H = [ S² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2 * A. 

But since S1² + S2² + S3² is a constant (each is 3/4 ħ²), then H can be written in terms of S² minus constants. Therefore, if the state ψ is an eigenstate of S², then it will also be an eigenstate of H. Alternatively, since the constants terms will just shift the energy by a constant. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of H in the given state. Since the question is whether it's an eigenstate, we can check if Hψ is proportional to ψ. Let's try to compute Hψ.

First, let me note that the state ψ is symmetric under permutations of the particles except for the positions of the down spin. Let me see the structure: each term has two up and one down, but each position for the down is different. So overall, it's symmetric under exchange of particles because the down is equally represented in each position. Hmm, so it's a symmetric state. That might be important because the Hamiltonian is also symmetric in all the particles, so symmetric states may be eigenstates.

Alternatively, maybe this state is the symmetric combination of two up and one down spins. Let's see. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or 1/2 again (maybe different multiplicity). The state given is a symmetric combination; since the total spin S=3/2 would have maximum symmetry? Let me recall the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles:

The possible total spin values are 3/2 (symmetric), 1/2 (antisymmetric?), but actually, the multiplicity might be different. Wait, three spin-1/2 can couple to total spin 3/2 (quartet state) or 1/2 (doublet or two different doublets?). Let me think: when coupling two spin-1/2, you get spin 1 and 0. Adding the third spin-1/2:

- Start with S1 and S2: S12 can be 1 or 0.

- Then S12 + S3: if S12 is 1, adding S3 gives 3/2 or 1/2. If S12 is 0, adding S3 gives 1/2.

Therefore, total spins: 3/2, 1/2, and 1/2 again (so total multiplicity 4 (3/2), 2 (from S12=1) + 2 (from S12=0) = 4? Wait, actually, total possible dimensions are 2^3 =8. 4 (S=3/2) + 4 (S=1/2) would be 8? Wait, no. Wait, the total spin multiplets:

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The 3/2 multiplet has dimension 4 (m=3/2,1/2,-1/2,-3/2) and the 1/2 multiplets have dimensions 2 each. Wait, but actually, there are two different S=1/2 states? Because when you have three particles, the symmetric and antisymmetric?

Wait, the total number of states is 8. For three spin-1/2, the total spin can be:

The triplet (S=1) and singlet (S=0) when you have two particles, but adding the third complicates it. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S² on the given state. Since if the state is an eigenstate of S², then H would be proportional to an eigenstate.

Alternatively, let me compute Hψ.

First, note that H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Each term like S1·S2 can be written as (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Wait, but S_i · S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2 /2 - (S_i² + S_j²)/2. So perhaps using that identity.

Therefore, S1·S2 = [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2²]/2. Therefore, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as H = A/2 [ (S1+S2)^2 + (S1+S3)^2 + (S2+S3)^2 - 3(S1² + S2² + S3²) ].

But since each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so maybe this comes into play. But this might complicate more.

Alternatively, let's try to compute the expectation value of H in the state ψ. Since the question is whether it's an eigenstate, we can check if Hψ is proportional to ψ. Let me see.

First, let me note that in the state ψ, each term has two spins up and one spin down, and all permutations of which spin is down. The coefficients are all 1/√3. So the state is symmetric under exchange of particles, except for the position of the down spin.

Now, let's compute the action of H on ψ. Since H is a sum of terms acting on pairs, so we can compute each term's contribution.

Let me first compute the expectation value of S1·S2. Since the Hamiltonian is symmetric, the expectation value of each pair term (S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3) will be the same, so we can compute one and multiply by three.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩) = 3A⟨S1·S2⟩.

So if I compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, then multiply by 3A, that's the expectation value.

Alternatively, if the state is an eigenstate, then ⟨H⟩ would be the eigenvalue. So let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Let me write out the state ψ:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩_{123} + |↑↓↑⟩_{123} + |↓↑↑⟩_{123} ]

Each term is a product state of the three spins. Let's denote |↑↑↓⟩ as the state with particle 1 up, 2 up, 3 down, etc.

First, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩. The operator S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, so let's consider how it acts on each term of ψ.

Let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i · S_j between two spins can be calculated using the formula:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ²/4 * [ ⟨(S1_z + S2_z)^2⟩ - ⟨S1_z^2⟩ - ⟨S2_z^2⟩ + ... ] Wait, actually, maybe better to note that for two spins,

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1+S2)^2 - (S1² + S2²)/2. Since each S_i² = (ħ²)(s(s+1)) with s=1/2, so 3ħ²/4. Therefore,

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1+S2)^2 - (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4)/2 = (1/2)(S1+S2)^2 - (3ħ²/4).

Alternatively, this might not be necessary here. Maybe it's easier to compute in terms of the basis.

Alternatively, since the state is expressed in the z-basis, and S1·S2 has terms like S1z S2z, S1x S2x, S1y S2y. But perhaps easier to compute the expectation value in the given basis.

Alternatively, note that for two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state |a⟩|b⟩ is ⟨a|⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩|b⟩. Since S1 acts on the first and S2 on the second, the expectation value would be (ħ²/4)( (a_z)(b_z) + a_x b_x + a_y b_y ), but since in the z-basis, the x and y components of the spin projectors would give zero except when the spins are in superposition. Alternatively, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, for two spin-1/2 particles in the state |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be calculated for each pair.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that in any basis, for two spins:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)( ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ )

Which simplifies to:

= (1/4)(⟨S1^2 + 2S1·S2 + S2^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ )

Wait, actually that's circular, so scratch that.

Alternatively, let's recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1+S2)^2 - (S1² + S2²)/2. Therefore,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - (⟨S1²⟩ + ⟨S2²⟩)/2.

Since S1² and S2² are just constants (3ħ²/4 each), so their expectation values are same. Therefore,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S1+S2)^2⟩ - (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4)/2 = (1/2)⟨(S1+S2)^2⟩ - (3ħ²/4).

Therefore, to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, we need to compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩. But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + 2S1·S2 + S2². Therefore, this seems circular again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps just compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ directly in the given state. Let's proceed term by term.

First, let's consider the state ψ. Each term in ψ is a product of three spins. Let me first compute S1·S2 acting on each term.

Take the first term: |↑1↑2↓3⟩.

The action of S1·S2 on this term is S1·S2 on the first two spins, since the third is unaffected. Let's compute S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩.

Similarly for other terms.

First, compute S1·S2|↑↑⟩. Let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles:

The operator S1·S2 can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. Since S1 = ħ/2 σ1, S2 = ħ/2 σ2, so S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2).

The Pauli matrices dot product has the property that σ1·σ2 = I (identity) when acting on |↑↑⟩ or |↓↓⟩, and σ1·σ2 = -I when acting on |↑↓⟩ or |↓↑⟩. Wait, actually that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.

Actually, σ_i · σ_j = σ_i_x σ_j_x + σ_i_y σ_j_y + σ_i_z σ_j_z. So for the state |↑↑⟩ in z-basis, the z components are both +1, so σ_z terms give +1 for each, so σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩. The x and y components: σ_x on |↑⟩ gives (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/√2, but multiplied with σ_x on the second particle, so the cross terms might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe better to recall that the eigenvalues of σ1·σ2 in the z-basis:

For the state |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 acts as ( (σ_x1 σ_x2 + σ_y1 σ_y2 + σ_z1 σ_z2 ) |↑↑⟩ )

Compute each term:

σ_z1 σ_z2 |↑↑⟩ = (1)(1)|↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

σ_x1 σ_x2 |↑↑⟩: Let's write σ_x on |↑⟩:

σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ (times a factor?), wait no, actually σ_x is a matrix:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

So σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So applying σ_x1 on the first spin and σ_x2 on the second:

σ_x1 σ_x2 |↑↑⟩ = σ_x1 |↑⟩ ⊗ σ_x2 |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ_y1 σ_y2 |↑↑⟩: σ_y has an i factor, but if we ignore constants for now (since we can work with the anticommutators... Wait, actually, perhaps the eigenvalue here might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps better to recall that the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in a state can be related to the spin part.

Alternatively, maybe we can recall that the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state |a⟩|b⟩ is (ħ²/4)(3 cosθ + 1), where θ is the angle between the spins? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me compute it numerically.

Let me compute ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩.

Expressed in terms of σ matrices, S1·S2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ1 · σ2). Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ²/4)⟨↑↑| σ1 · σ2 |↑↑⟩.

Compute σ1 · σ2 in matrix form when acting on the basis |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩.

The σ1 · σ2 matrix can be written as:

σ1 · σ2 = 
[ σ_x1 σ_x2 + σ_y1 σ_y2 + σ_z1 σ_z2 ]

Let me write it in matrix form:

For two qubits, the Pauli matrices tensor products are as follows:

σ_x1 σ_x2 = σ_x ⊗ σ_x,

σ_y1 σ_y2 = σ_y ⊗ σ_y,

σ_z1 σ_z2 = σ_z ⊗ σ_z.

So, σ1 · σ2 = (σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z).

Let me compute this matrix:

First, the identity matrix is I⊗I = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]

σ_x⊗σ_x:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so tensor product with itself is:

[ [0*0, 0*1, 1*0, 1*1;

0*1, 0*0, 1*1, 1*0;

1*0, 1*1, 0*0, 0*1;

1*1, 1*0, 0*1, 0*0 ] ]

Wait, actually it's better to write matrices step by step.

Actually, the tensor product σ_x⊗σ_x would be a 4x4 matrix where the (i,j) element is (σ_x)_a,b (σ_x)_c,d, but arranged appropriately. Alternatively, let's note the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, note that σ1·σ2 has eigenvalues of 3ħ²/4 for the triplet states (S=1) and -ħ²/4 for the singlet (S=0). Wait, but for two spin-1/2 particles, S can be 1 or 0, so the eigenvalues of (σ1·σ2) would be (S(S+1) - 3/4 )? Wait, S² for two spins: S² = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2S1·S2. Therefore,

S1·S2 = (S² - S1² - S2²)/2

So for S=1, S² = 2ħ² (since s=1 gives S²=2ħ²). So S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2)/2 = ( (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 ) /2 = (ħ²/2)/2 = ħ²/4. Wait, but S²=2ħ², so S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2)/2 = ( (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 ) /2 = (ħ²/2)/2 = ħ²/4. Hmm, so S1·S2 would have eigenvalue ħ²/4 for S=1.

For S=0, S² =0, so S1·S2 = (0 - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 = (- 3ħ²/2)/2 = -3ħ²/4.

But the operator σ1·σ2 (without the ħ²/4 factor) would have eigenvalues 1 (for triplet) and -1 (for singlet). Therefore, S1·S2 (with the 1/4 factor) would have eigenvalues ħ²/4 *1 and ħ²/4*(-1). Therefore, the eigenvalues are 3ħ²/4? Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, let's do this carefully. Let me consider S1·S2 as (ħ/2 σ1)·(ħ/2 σ2) = (ħ²/4) (σ1 · σ2). Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2). The eigenvalues of σ1 · σ2 are 1 for the triplet (S=1) and -1 for the singlet (S=0). Therefore, S1·S2 has eigenvalues (ħ²/4)(1) and (ħ²/4)(-1). So eigenvalues 3ħ²/4 divided by 3? Wait no, 1*(ħ²/4). Wait, so the eigenvalues are ħ²/4 and -ħ²/4. 

Wait, so when acting on a state with S=1, the eigenvalue is ħ²/4, and for S=0, it's -3ħ²/4? Wait no. Wait, if σ1 · σ2 has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then S1·S2 has eigenvalues (ħ²/4)*1 and (ħ²/4)*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ħ²/4 and -ħ²/4. Wait, but for the triplet, which has S=1, then S1·S2 would be (S² - S1² - S2²)/2. Since S² is (ħ²)1(1+1)=2ħ², so (2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2)/2 = ( (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 ) / 2? Wait, let me compute again:

S1² = (3/4)ħ²,

S2² is same,

so S1·S2 = (S12² - S1² - S2²)/2,

so (S12² - 3ħ²/2)/2.

For S12=1: S12² = (ħ)^2*(1)(1+1)= 2ħ²,

so S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2)/2 = ( (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 ) /2? Wait: 2ħ² - 3ħ²/2 = (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 = ħ²/2.

Then dividing by 2: (ħ²/2)/2 = ħ²/4. 

For S12=0: S12²=0,

so S1·S2= (0 - 3ħ²/2)/2 = - 3ħ²/4. 

Ah right, so the eigenvalues are ħ²/4 for triplet (S=1) and -3ħ²/4 for singlet (S=0). Therefore, in terms of σ1·σ2 operator (which is without the ħ²/4 factor), the eigenvalues would be 1 and -3? Wait no, since S1·S2 is (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2). So the operator σ1 · σ2 has eigenvalues 1 (for triplet) and -3 (for singlet)? Wait, because (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2) = S1·S2, so:

S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2). 

So if S1·S2 has eigenvalues ħ²/4 (for S=1) and -3ħ²/4 (for S=0), then σ1 · σ2 has eigenvalues 1 and -3. Wait, but if S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ · σ), so setting eigenvalues equal:

For triplet: (ħ²/4)(σ · σ) = ħ²/4 ⇒ σ · σ =1,

For singlet: (ħ²/4)(σ · σ) = -3ħ²/4 ⇒ σ · σ = -3.

Ah, so σ1 · σ2 has eigenvalues 1 and -3. 

Therefore, in the |↑↑⟩ state, which is part of the triplet (since |↑↑⟩ is a part of the S=1, M=1 state). Therefore, the eigenvalue for σ1 · σ2 on |↑↑⟩ would be 1? Wait, but |↑↑⟩ is actually a singlet component? Wait no. Wait, the triplet states are symmetric under exchange. The state |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet (symmetric) since it's symmetric. The singlet is antisymmetric. Let me confirm:

The triplet states are:

|1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

|1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2,

|1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩,

and the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Therefore, the state |↑↑⟩ is the |1,1⟩ state, which is a triplet, so the eigenvalue of σ1 · σ2 on this state is 1. Therefore, ⟨↑↑| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↑⟩ =1.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)*1 = ħ²/4.

Similarly, let's compute the expectation of S1·S2 on the state |↑↓⟩.

First, note that |↑↓⟩ can be written as a combination of triplet and singlet. Specifically, the triplet state |1,0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, and the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2. Therefore, |↑↓⟩ = ( |1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩ ) / √2.

Therefore, applying σ1 · σ2 to |↑↓⟩:

σ1 · σ2 |↑↓⟩ = σ1 · σ2 [ (|1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩)/√2 ]

Since σ · σ has eigenvalue 1 on the triplet and -3 on the singlet:

= [1 |1,0⟩ + (-3)|singlet⟩ ] /√2

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↓⟩ = ⟨ (1,0| + singlet| ) /√2 [1 |1,0⟩ + (-3)|singlet⟩ ] /√2 )

= (1)(⟨1,0|1,0⟩ + ⟨1,0|(-3)|singlet⟩ + (-3)⟨singlet|1,0⟩ + (-3)(-3)⟨singlet|singlet⟩ ) / 2

But ⟨1,0|singlet⟩ =0 and ⟨singlet|1,0⟩=0 since they are orthogonal. Similarly, ⟨singlet|singlet⟩ =1,

⟨1,0|1,0⟩ =1,

Thus,

= [1*1 + (-3)(-3)*1 ] /2 = (1 +9)/2 = 10/2=5? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, actually, perhaps I made an error here.

Wait, let's re-express the expectation value:

⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↓⟩ = ⟨ (|1,0⟩ - |singlet⟩)/√2 | σ1 · σ2 | (|1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩)/√2 ⟩

Wait, actually, the state |↑↓⟩ is (|1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩)/√2, right? Or is it (|↑↓⟩ = (|1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩)/√2)? Wait, no:

Actually, the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2,

and the triplet |1,0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Therefore, |↑↓⟩ can be written as:

|↑↓⟩ = (|1,0⟩ + |singlet⟩)/√2 + (something?) Wait, let's do it properly.

Let me write |↑↓⟩ as a combination of |1,0⟩ and the singlet:

Let me denote the triplet state as T = |1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2,

and the singlet S = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Then, solving for |↑↓⟩:

Let me write:

T + S = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2 = (2 |↑↓⟩ )/√2 = √2 |↑↓⟩,

so |↑↓⟩ = (T + S)/√2

Similarly, T - S = (2|↓↑⟩)/√2,

so |↓↑⟩ = (T - S)/√2.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| is (√2)(T - S)/2 ?

Wait maybe better to just compute:

⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↓⟩ = ⟨ (T + S)/√2 | σ1 · σ2 | (T + S)/√2 ⟩.

Since σ1 · σ2 T = T (since T is a triplet state, which has eigenvalue 1),

and σ1 · σ2 S = -3 S (since the singlet has eigenvalue -3).

Therefore,

⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↓⟩ = ( ⟨T + S | /√2 ) ( σ1 · σ2 (T + S)/√2 )

= (1/2) ⟨T + S | [ σ1·σ2 T + σ1·σ2 S ] / √2 ?

Wait, sorry, let's compute step by step.

First, expand the inner product:

⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2) |↑↓⟩ = ⟨ (T + S)/√2 | σ1 · σ2 | (T + S)/√2 ⟩

= ⟨ T | σ1 · σ2 | T ⟩/(2) + ⟨ T | σ1 · σ2 | S ⟩/(2) + ⟨ S | σ1 · σ2 | T ⟩/(2) + ⟨ S | σ1 · σ2 | S ⟩/(2).

But ⟨T | σ1 · σ2 | T ⟩ = ⟨T | 1*T⟩ = 1,

⟨ S | σ1 · σ2 | S ⟩ = ⟨S | -3*S⟩ = -3,

The cross terms ⟨ T | σ1 · σ2 | S ⟩ and ⟨ S | σ1 · σ2 | T ⟩ are zero because T and S are orthogonal (they are different eigenvectors of σ1 · σ2).

Therefore, total expectation value is (1 + (-3))/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| (σ1 · σ2)|↑↓⟩ = -1, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ for |↑↓⟩ is (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4.

Therefore, to recap:

- For the state |↑↑⟩, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ²/4,

- For |↑↓⟩, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -ħ²/4,

- Similarly, for |↓↑⟩ would also give ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -ħ²/4,

- For |↓↓⟩, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ²/4 (since |↓↓⟩ is part of the triplet state with S=1).

Wait, let me confirm for |↓↓⟩:

|↓↓⟩ is the |1,-1⟩ state, so part of the triplet, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ would be ħ²/4.

Alright. Now, returning to the original problem. The given state ψ is a combination of three terms:

|↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. Let's look at each term and compute S1·S2 acting on them.

First, take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩.

This is a product state of the first two spins being ↑↑ and the third being ↓. So S1·S2 acts on the first two spins, which are ↑↑. As we saw, this gives (ħ²/4)*1. The third spin is unaffected, so the whole term becomes (ħ²/4)*|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, the second term is |↑↓↑⟩. Here, the first spin is ↑, second is ↓, third is ↑. The operator S1·S2 acts on the first two spins (↑↓). For the first two spins, which are ↑↓, the expectation value is -ħ²/4. So acting with S1·S2 on this term gives (-ħ²/4)*|↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, the third term is |↓↑↑⟩. The first spin is ↓, second is ↑, third is ↑. The operator S1·S2 acts on the first two spins (↓↑), which is similar to the second term, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ is -ħ²/4. So acting on this term gives (-ħ²/4)*|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, putting this all together, when we apply S1·S2 to the entire state ψ:

S1·S2 ψ = (1/√3)[ (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ + (-ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ ]

Similarly, we have to do the same for S1·S3 and S2·S3 terms in the Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian is symmetric in all pairs, the results for S1·S3 and S2·S3 should be similar, but acting on different pairs.

Let me compute S1·S3 ψ:

First, note that S1·S3 acts on the first and third spins. Let's go through each term in ψ:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. The first and third spins are ↑ and ↓. S1·S3 acts on these two. So the first spin ↑, third spin ↓. The state of the first and third spins is ↑↓. So similar to before, ⟨S1·S3⟩ for ↑↓ is -ħ²/4. Therefore, S1·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives (-ħ²/4)*(first and third spins being ↑↓), so the entire term becomes (-ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩. 

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩. Here, the first spin is ↑, third is ↑. The first and third spins are ↑↑, so ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ħ²/4. Thus, acting on this term gives (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩. The first spin is ↓, third is ↑. So first and third spins are ↓↑, which is again ↑↓ under exchange, so ⟨S1·S3⟩ for this pair is also -ħ²/4. Wait, actually the state is ↓ and ↑, so the pair is ↓↑. The expectation value for S1·S3 here would be the same as for ↑↓, which is -ħ²/4.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H, which is A times the sum of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. The state psi is 1 over sqrt(3) times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a state to be an eigenstate of an operator. If applying the Hamiltonian to psi just gives back a scalar multiple of psi, then psi is an eigenstate of H with that eigenvalue. 

First, let me make sure I remember how the spin operators work. Each spin-1/2 particle has spin operators S_i (for i=1,2,3) which can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. But maybe I don't need to go into the matrix representation here. Instead, maybe I can use some properties of the spin operators and the symmetry of the state.

The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The spin operators for each particle interact pairwise. The given state psi is symmetric in some way. Let me see: the state has each of the three terms with two spins up and one down, but rotated around the different particles. That is, each term has exactly two up spins and one down spin, but each term has a different particle in the down position. So, the state is symmetric under permutations of the particles? Let me check that. 

Suppose I swap particles 1 and 2, then the first term up1 up2 down3 becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the original term because the order of the spins doesn't matter in the tensor product as long as the positions are correct. Wait, actually, the notation up1 up2 down3 means particle 1 is up, particle 2 is up, particle 3 is down. If you swap 1 and 2, it becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as up1 up2 down3 because the tensor product is ordered, so actually no, swapping particles 1 and 2 would change the first term to up2 up1 down3, which is a different term unless the state is symmetric. Wait, but the original state has three terms: each with two up spins and one down spin, but each term has a different particle down. So, the three terms are cyclic permutations. Therefore, the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles. That's an important point because the Hamiltonian is also symmetric with respect to permutations of the particles since it treats all pairs equally. So, if the state is symmetric, maybe it's in a symmetric subspace, and the Hamiltonian preserves that symmetry? 

So perhaps the state is part of a symmetric subspace, and the Hamiltonian acts within that subspace. That might mean that the expectation value can be found using some symmetry arguments. But we need to check whether psi is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value directly. Let me see. The energy expectation value <H> is equal to A times the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. Since the state is symmetric in all three particles, the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 should be the same. So, I can compute the expectation of one of them and multiply by 3. 

But let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S·S between them can be written in terms of the total spin. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term individually. Let me recall that S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). So, the dot product is the sum of the products of each component. Therefore, for each S_i · S_j term, we can compute the expectation value over the given state. Let me try this approach.

First, let's note that the state is given as:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

where each term is in the order of particles 1, 2, 3. 

Let me first compute the expectation of S1·S2. Since S1 and S2 are operators acting on particles 1 and 2 respectively. 

The expectation value <S1·S2> would be <psi | S1·S2 | psi>.

Similarly, we have <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>, but as the state is symmetric, they should all be equal, so let's just compute one and multiply by three.

First, let me compute <S1·S2>. Let me expand this:

First, note that S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). 

So, the expectation of S1·S2 is the sum over the components.

Let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the operators can be represented as Pauli matrices divided by 2. So, S_i^x = (σ_i^x)/2, etc. But maybe it's easier to use the fact that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation of S1·S2 is (3/4) if they are in a triplet state and (-1/4) if in a singlet state. But here, the state is a three-particle state, so maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of the z-components. 

Alternatively, perhaps first compute the expectation of S1_z S2_z, then the expectation of (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y). Since S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z). Let me note that:

The cross terms (the x and y parts) can be related to the total spin operators. In particular, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y = (S1_x)^2 (S2_x)^2 + ...? Wait, maybe better to recall that S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 all over 2? Wait, no, the formula is S·S = (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 over 2? Wait, actually, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2]/2. But since each S_i^2 for a spin-1/2 particle is (3/4)ħ². So, if we can compute (S1 + S2)^2 acting on the state, but given that the state is a three-particle state, perhaps this complicates things, but maybe we can still proceed.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, perhaps we can consider the total spin of the system. Let me see. The total spin S_total^2 might commute with the Hamiltonian, but maybe the Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise interactions, so maybe the total spin is not necessarily conserved unless the interactions are invariant under SU(2), but the pairwise interactions are.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of the system as three spins, each interacting with the others, so the total spin may not be conserved, but maybe the Hamiltonian is symmetric, so it will preserve some symmetry. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's try to compute the expectation value directly.

First, let me compute <S1_z S2_z>. Let's see, for each term in the state:

The first term is |↑↑↓⟩. So particle 1 is up, 2 is up, 3 is down. So for S1_z S2_z on this term: S1_z is +1/2, S2_z is +1/2, so the product is (+1/2)(+1/2) = 1/4. 

The second term is |↑↓↑⟩. Here, particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down, particle 3 is up. So S1_z is +1/2, S2_z is -1/2, so their product is (+1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Third term is |↓↑↑⟩. Here, particle 1 is down, particle 2 is up, particle 3 is up. So S1_z is -1/2, S2_z is +1/2, product is (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4.

Therefore, when we sum over the terms, the expectation of S1_z S2_z is (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) divided by 3 (since the state is normalized with 1/sqrt(3)), so:

< S1_z S2_z > = [ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] / 3 = (1/4 -1/4 -1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Wait, let me check that again. Each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(3), so the square is 1/3. But expectation value is the sum over all terms in psi of the inner product of each term with the operator acting on each term. Wait, actually, maybe my approach was wrong. Let me clarify:

The expectation value <S1_z S2_z> is computed as:

psi^{dagger} S1_z S2_z psi. Since the operators act only on the first two particles, the third particle is unaffected. 

Let me write the state as:

psi = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So when we apply S1_z S2_z to each term:

First term: S1_z S2_z (|↑↑↓⟩) = (1/2)(1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ = 1/4 |↑↑↓⟩

Second term: S1_z S2_z (|↑↓↑⟩) = (1/2)(-1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ = -1/4 |↑↓↑⟩

Third term: S1_z S2_z (|↓↑↑⟩) = (-1/2)(1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ = -1/4 |↓↑↑⟩

Therefore, the entire operator applied to psi is (1/√3)[1/4 |↑↑↓⟩ -1/4 |↑↓↑⟩ -1/4 |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Now, to compute the inner product <psi | S1_z S2_z | psi >, we need to take the conjugate transpose of psi, which is the same as the dagger of the vector, so (1/√3) times the sum of the conjugate terms. Since all the spins are in the z-basis, the conjugation doesn't change anything. So, the inner product will be:

(1/√3) [⟨↑↑↓| + ⟨↑↓↑| + ⟨↓↑↑| ] multiplied by (1/√3)[1/4 |↑↑↓⟩ -1/4 |↑↓↑⟩ -1/4 |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Multiplying these out, we get (1/3) times the sum over all terms of ⟨term i | term j multiplied by the coefficients.

So, each term:

The first term: ⟨↑↑↓| * (1/4 |↑↑↓⟩) gives 1/4, multiplied by 1/3. 

The second term: ⟨↑↓↑| * (-1/4 |↑↓↑⟩) gives -1/4, multiplied by 1/3.

Third term: ⟨↓↑↑| * (-1/4 |↓↑↑⟩) gives -1/4, multiplied by 1/3.

Additionally, cross terms? Wait, but in the product, the terms like ⟨↑↑↓| multiplied by -1/4 |↑↓↑⟩ would be zero because the states are orthogonal. Similarly, all cross terms will vanish because the basis vectors are orthogonal. Therefore, the expectation value is (1/3)[1/4 -1/4 -1/4] = (1/3)(-1/4) = -1/12. So that's correct. 

So the expectation of S1_z S2_z is -1/12. But we need the expectation of all components: S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z. 

Now, what about the other components? Let's recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be computed as follows:

The total expectation value of S1·S2 is equal to (3/4)(⟨1 | 2⟩)^2 - 1/4, where ⟨1 | 2⟩ is the overlap in some basis. Wait, maybe that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1+S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2

Wait, let me verify that formula. 

Starting from (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + 2 S1·S2 + S2^2. Therefore,

(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 = 2 S1·S2 => 

S1·S2 = [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2]/2. 

So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, if we can compute the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2, then we can find the expectation of S1·S2. But in our case, the operators are acting on a three-particle state. Let me see. The total spin squared (S_total)^2 would be different, but here we are dealing with (S1 + S2)^2 acting on the first two particles. Let me see:

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 is equal to ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩. 

But S1^2 for a spin-1/2 particle is ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) )ħ² = (3/4)ħ², so each S_i^2 is 3/4. Since we are working in units where ħ=1 (since the answer is given in terms of ħ², so maybe we can set ħ=1 for now and multiply back at the end). Let's assume ħ=1 for simplicity, so S1^2 = 3/4. 

Therefore, ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = (3/4 + 3/4) + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 3/2 + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩. 

Therefore, solving for ⟨S1·S2⟩, we have:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 3/2 ] / 2.

So if I can compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩, then I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the other components. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe compute the expectation of S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y, then sum those with the z-component.

Alternatively, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state can also be computed using the singlet and triplet states. 

If the two spins are in a triplet state (total spin 1), then ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) = ( ( ( (3/2)(3/2 +1) ) - 3/4 - 3/4 )) / 2 

Wait, let me compute:

(S1 + S2)^2 for triplet (spin 1): (1)(1+1) = 2, so (S1 + S2)^2 = 2. 

Therefore, (2 - 3/4 -3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25. So ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 3/4 ? Wait, 0.25=1/4? Wait, no, wait:

Wait the formula gives [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2]/2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25. So yes, 1/4.

In the singlet state (total spin 0), (S1 + S2)^2 = 0, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = ( - 1.5)/2 = - 0.75 = -3/4. Wait but that contradicts what I remember. Let me check:

Wait, actually for a singlet state, S1·S2 is -3/4. For triplet state, it's +1/4? Wait that can't be. Wait, hold on. Wait the formula gives for the triplet (spin 1):

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ (S_total^2)^triplet - S1^2 - S2^2 ] /2 = ( ( ( (3/2)(3/2 +1) ) - 3/4 -3/4 )) / 2. Wait actually, if S_total^2 is for spin 1, then S_total^2 = 1*(1+1) = 2. So 2 - 1.5 divided by 2 is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25, which is 1/4. 

For the singlet (S_total^2 =0):

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (0 - 3/4 -3/4)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -0.75 = -3/4. 

Wait so in the singlet state, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -3/4, and in the triplet, it's +1/4. Hmm, that seems correct? Because the total spin squared in the triplet is 2, so the formula gives that. But actually, I thought the expectation of S1·S2 in the singlet would be more negative, but maybe that's correct. So in that case, if the two spins are in a singlet, their interaction energy would be negative, which makes sense as antiparallel spins have lower energy. 

But in our case, particles 1 and 2 in the given state. Let's see, the given three-particle state has terms where particles 1 and 2 are both up, both down, or one up and the other down. So actually, the two-particle states of particles 1 and 2 can be in a variety of states. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the state of particles 1 and 2 in each term of the three-particle state. 

Breaking down the three-particle state:

Each term is:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, particle 3 down.

2. |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 up, 2 down, 3 up.

3. |↓↑↑⟩: particles 1 down, 2 up, 3 up.

Therefore, the two-particle states for particles 1 and 2 are:

- |↑↑⟩ in the first term,

- |↑↓⟩ in the second term,

- |↓↑⟩ in the third term.

Therefore, the combined state of particles 1 and 2 in each case is a superposition of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩. The third term has |↓↑⟩, which is different from the second term's |↑↓⟩, but if we consider that in the total three-particle state, the third particle's spin is also varying, so the combined state might not factorize. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the two-particle reduced density matrix for particles 1 and 2. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's compute the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 on the given state. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ directly. Let's see:

The operator (S1 + S2)^2 acts on the first two particles. Let's compute its expectation in each term of the state.

Starting with the first term |↑↑↓⟩:

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ 

Compute (S1 + S2)^2 on |↑↑⟩:

First, S1 |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑⟩,

S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑⟩,

Therefore, (S1 + S2)|↑↑⟩ = (1/2 +1/2)|↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

So (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1 + S2)|↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩. Wait, no, wait, hold on:

Wait, actually, S1 and S2 are vector operators, so (S1 + S2)^2 is the sum over components squared. Wait, perhaps I confused something here. 

Wait, let me clarify: The operator (S1 + S2)^2 is the same as the sum over components:

(S1 + S2)^2 = (S1_x + S2_x)^2 + (S1_y + S2_y)^2 + (S1_z + S2_z)^2.

When acting on |↑↑⟩, let's compute each component. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation by breaking into components. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value directly.

Let me try again. 

The expectation value ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ is:

ψ† (S1 + S2)^2 ψ. 

Let me first compute (S1 + S2)^2 term by term:

First, write out (S1 + S2)^2 on the first term |↑↑↓⟩:

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩. Since S1 and S2 act on the first two particles, the third particle's state remains |↓⟩, so we can focus on the first two particles. 

For particles 1 and 2 in the state |↑↑⟩, let's compute (S1 + S2)^2.

We can use the formula for (S1 + S2)^2:

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

So for |↑↑⟩, S1^2 |↑↑⟩ = (3/4)|↑↑⟩, same for S2^2, so total S1^2 + S2^2 = (3/4 + 3/4)|↑↑⟩ = 3/2 |↑↑⟩.

Then 2 S1·S2 acting on |↑↑⟩: 

Earlier we have S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ is S1·S2 applied to |↑↑⟩. Since both spins are up, their dot product is (S1_z S2_z + ...), but more precisely, since they are in the z-basis, the x and y components would be zero because the expectation of S_x and S_y for an up state is zero. Wait, but actually, the operator S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z applied to |↑↑⟩:

S1_z S2_z |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)|↑↑⟩ = 1/4 |↑↑⟩

The S_x and S_y terms: Since |↑⟩ has S_x and S_y components as well. Let's compute S1_x S2_x |↑↑⟩:

The operator S1_x on |↑⟩ is (1/2)(|↓⟩) because:

S_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(|↓⟩), but since we're in natural units, let's say S_x |↑⟩ = (1/2)(|↓⟩), similarly S_y |↑⟩ = (1/2i)(|↓⟩). But since the state is |↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩, then S1_x S2_x |↑↑⟩ is S1_x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↑⟩ = (1/2 |↓⟩) ⊗ (1/2 |↓⟩ ) = (1/4)|↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |↑↑⟩ = ( -1/4)|↓↓⟩ (since S_y has an i factor, but when squared, the i's cancel). 

Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, since S1·S2 for two spins in a triplet state (like |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet) has an expectation value of +1/4. Because when both spins are up, the total spin is 1, so using the earlier result, the expectation of S1·S2 is +1/4. 

Wait, in the triplet state |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet manifold (along with |↑↓ + ↓↑⟩/√2 and |↓↓⟩), the expectation of S1·S2 in the |↑↑⟩ state is actually (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩:

Let me compute S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩:

S1_z S2_z |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)|↑↑⟩ = 1/4 |↑↑⟩.

Now S1_x S2_x |↑↑⟩:

As before, S_x |↑⟩ = 1/2 (|↓⟩), so S1_x S2_x |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)^2 |↓↓⟩.

Similarly S1_y S2_y |↑↑⟩ = ( (-i/2)(|↓⟩) ) (from S_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩ ) so squared would be (i^2)/4 |↓↓⟩ = -1/4 |↓↓⟩. 

Therefore, the sum S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y = (1/4 |↓↓⟩ -1/4 |↓↓⟩ ) = 0. 

Therefore, S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩ is (S_z term) 1/4 |↑↑⟩, and the x and y terms give 0. So total S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = 1/4 |↑↑⟩. 

Therefore ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = 1/4. Therefore the expectation of S1·S2 in |↑↑⟩ is 1/4. 

So going back to (S1 + S2)^2 acting on |↑↑⟩:

S1^2 + S2^2 = 3/4 + 3/4 = 3/2, so (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (3/2 + 2*(1/4)) |↑↑⟩ = (3/2 + 1/2)|↑↑⟩ = 2 |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 |↑↑⟩, so the eigenvalue is 2, which matches the triplet state (since S(S+1) with S=1 gives 2). 

Similarly, let's look at the second term in the three-particle state: |↑↓↑⟩. The first two particles are |↑↓⟩. Let's compute (S1 + S2)^2 on |↑↓⟩. 

First, let's note that |↑↓⟩ can be part of either the triplet or the singlet. The singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), while the triplet has a symmetric combination. 

But here we have just |↑↓⟩. Let's compute (S1 + S2)^2 on |↑↓⟩:

Again, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. 

Compute each term:

S1^2 |↑↓⟩ = (3/4)|↑↓⟩,

Same for S2^2: (3/4)|↑↓⟩,

Total S1^2 + S2^2 = (3/4 + 3/4)|↑↓⟩ = 3/2 |↑↓⟩.

Now compute S1·S2 |↑↓⟩. Let's do this component-wise:

S1_z S2_z |↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)|↑↓⟩ = -1/4 |↑↓⟩.

S1_x S2_x |↑↓⟩:

S1_x |↑⟩ = 1/2 |↓⟩,

S2_x |↓⟩ = 1/2 |↑⟩,

So S1_x S2_x |↑↓⟩ = (1/2 |↓⟩) ⊗ (1/2 |↑⟩ ) = (1/4)|↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |↑↓⟩:

S1_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩,

S2_y |↓⟩ = (-i/2)|↑⟩,

So their product is (i/2)(-i/2)|↓↑⟩ = ( -i^2 /4)|↓↑⟩ = (1/4)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y = (1/4 |↓↑⟩ + 1/4 |↓↑⟩ ) = 1/2 |↓↑⟩.

So adding the z-component:

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = ( -1/4 |↑↓⟩ ) + 1/2 |↓↑⟩.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe instead of breaking it down, we can compute the expectation value.

Wait, actually, the state is |↑↓⟩, which is not an eigenstate of S1·S2 or (S1 + S2)^2. Therefore, the expectation value might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 on |↑↓⟩.

Alternatively, let's compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

First, (S1 + S2)^2 = 2 S1·S2 + S1^2 + S2^2. Wait no, it's S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. 

We already have S1^2 + S2^2 = 3/2, so we need 2 S1·S2 |↑↓⟩.

We need to compute S1·S2 |↑↓⟩. Let me do that again:

The z-component gives -1/4 |↑↓⟩,

The x-components: 

S1_x S2_x |↑↓⟩ = (1/2 |↓⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↓⟩) ? Wait earlier calculation:

Wait, S1_x acts on the first particle, S2_x on the second. So S1_x |↑⟩ is (1/2)|↓⟩, S2_x |↓⟩ is (1/2)|↑⟩. Therefore, their product is (1/2)(1/2)|↓↑⟩ = 1/4 |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |↑↓⟩ = (i/2 |↓⟩) * (-i/2 |↑⟩) = ( -i^2 /4 ) |↓↑⟩ = (1/4)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y gives 1/4 |↓↑⟩ + 1/4 |↓↑⟩ = 1/2 |↓↑⟩.

Therefore, total S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ is:

(S_z term) (-1/4)|↑↓⟩ + (S_x + S_y terms) 1/2 |↓↑⟩. 

Therefore, the total is -1/4 |↑↓⟩ + 1/2 |↓↑⟩.

Thus, 2 S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ is -1/2 |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩. 

Adding S1^2 + S2^2 (which is 3/2 |↑↓⟩):

Total (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ is 3/2 |↑↓⟩ - 1/2 |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = (3/2 - 1/2)|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩.

Hmm, so (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩.

The expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2 when the state is |↑↓⟩ would be the inner product of |↑↓⟩ with this result:

⟨↑↓| (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓| (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩) = 1*1 + ⟨↑↓| |↓↑⟩ = 1 + 0 =1. Wait, no, since |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are orthogonal, so it's ⟨↑↓| |↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓| |↓↑⟩ = 1 +0 =1. 

Wait but the operator acted on |↑↓⟩ gives |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩, so the inner product with ⟨↑↓| is 1, and the inner product with ⟨↓↑| would be 1, but since the original state is |↑↓⟩, then the expectation is 1. So ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ for |↑↓⟩ is 1. 

So if particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↓⟩, then the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 is 1. 

Similarly, for the third term |↓↑⟩, by symmetry, the expectation would be the same as for |↑↓⟩, so also 1.

Therefore, going back to the three-particle state:

The overall expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 is the average over the three terms. Let me compute the expectation over the state psi. 

The operator (S1 + S2)^2 acts on each term:

First term |↑↑↓⟩ gives (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 2 |↑↑↓⟩ (since the first two particles give 2, the third is untouched),

Second term |↑↓↑⟩ gives (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ (for particle 3) → which is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩,

Third term |↓↑↑⟩ gives (S1 + S2)^2 |↓↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ → which would be (since |↓↑⟩ is similar to |↑↓⟩, so (|↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩.

Therefore, the operator applied to the entire state:

(S1 + S2)^2 ψ = 1/√3 [ 2 |↑↑↓⟩ + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)⊗|↑⟩ + (|↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩)⊗|↑⟩ ]

Simplify the third term: (|↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩)⊗|↑⟩ = same as second term's operator result.

Therefore, combining terms:

= 1/√3 [ 2 |↑↑↓⟩ + (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) + (|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ) ]

Wait, let's parse each component:

The second term's operator result is (|↑↓⟩ + |
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*ħ², but I need to verify that.

First, let me recall that for spin 1/2 particles, each spin operator S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z, and the dot product S_i·S_j is given by (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). The Hamiltonian H is the sum of these dot products for all pairs of spins multiplied by A.

The state ψ given is (1/√3)(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). Each of these terms corresponds to a configuration where two spins are up and one is down, but arranged cyclically. Since it's symmetric in a way, maybe there's some symmetry here that makes it an eigenstate?

I remember that for systems of spins, eigenstates can often be found by considering the total spin. However, with three spins, the total spin can be different, but maybe the given state is a singlet or something? Wait, three spin 1/2 particles can have total spin S = 3/2, 1/2, or 1/2 again? Wait, actually, combining three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2, 1/2, and 1/2 (since 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 can sum to 3/2, or 1/2 in different ways). Hmm, so maybe this state is a part of one of those multiplets?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of the interaction terms. Let me consider the action of H on ψ. Since H is a sum of terms S_i·S_j for each pair, I can compute each term separately and then combine them.

First, let me write out ψ explicitly. Since the particles are distinguishable (since they're labeled 1,2,3), each term in ψ is a tensor product of the individual spin states. The normalization is 1/√3, so that's fine.

The state is symmetric under cyclic permutations of the particles: swapping particle 1→2→3→1, the state remains the same. Because each term in the sum is a cyclic permutation of each other. So maybe the state is symmetric under such permutations. Since the Hamiltonian is also symmetric under permutation of particles (since all pairs are included equally), perhaps the state is an eigenstate?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a symmetric combination, so when we act with H, which is symmetric, we get a multiple of the original state.

To confirm, I can compute the action of each S_i·S_j term on ψ and see if the result is proportional to ψ.

Let me start by recalling that S_i·S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). For spin 1/2 particles, the components of the spin operators are 1/2 times the Pauli matrices. However, in the basis of spin-up and spin-down, the z-component S_i^z is diagonal with eigenvalues ±1/2. The other components mix the up and down states.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H in the state ψ. Since ψ is a symmetric combination of three terms, each with two spins up and one down, arranged cyclically. Let's see.

The expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be A*(⟨S₁·S₂⟩ + ⟨S₁·S₃⟩ + ⟨S₂·S₃⟩). Due to the symmetry of the state, the expectation values of S₁·S₂, S₁·S₃, and S₂·S₃ should all be the same. So I can compute one, say ⟨S₁·S₂⟩, and multiply by 3, then multiply by A to get the total expectation value.

So first, let's compute ⟨S₁·S₂⟩. Let me write down the state ψ in terms of tensor products:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term is a tensor product of states for particles 1,2,3. So for example, |↑↑↓⟩ is |↑₁⟩⊗|↑₂⟩⊗|↓₃⟩, etc.

Now, S₁·S₂ acts only on the first two spins. So for each term in ψ, we can compute the action of S₁·S₂ on the first two spins, and then see how it affects the third spin (which is untouched by S₁·S₂). Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's compute S₁·S₂ on each term of ψ.

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. The first two spins are ↑ and ↑. Let's compute S₁·S₂ on this.

The dot product S₁·S₂ is (S₁^x S₂^x + S₁^y S₂^y + S₁^z S₂^z). 

In the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis for each spin, the operators can be represented as matrices. Let's recall that:

For a single spin, S^z has eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2, so in units of ħ, the matrices would be:

S^z = ħ/2 σ_z where σ_z is the Pauli matrix. But perhaps for simplicity, let's work with the Pauli matrices scaled by 1/2, so that the eigenvalues are ±1/2. Let me confirm:

Actually, the standard convention is S_i^x = ħ/2 σ_x, similarly for y and z. But since the problem mentions "spin operators", which typically are in units where ħ is included, so the actual operators S_i have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So when we compute S₁·S₂, the value would be (S₁^x S₂^x + S₁^y S₂^y + S₁^z S₂^z) evaluated on the states. But maybe in this problem, since the final answer is given in terms of ħ², perhaps we can just compute in units where ħ is factored out, and then reinsert at the end. Alternatively, maybe they just use ħ^2 as part of the constant. Let me see the final answer is 2/3 A ħ², so likely, we need to keep track of that.

Alternatively, perhaps if I work in units where ħ = 1, then the energy would be 2/3 A. But let me see.

Alternatively, let me remember that S_i·S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ). Since for spin 1/2, S_i^2 = (ħ²)( (1/2)(1/2 +1 )) = (3/4)ħ², so each S_i² is (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S₁·S₂ = (1/4)( (S₁ + S₂)^2 - 3/2 ħ² ). But maybe this approach complicates things?

Alternatively, for two spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The expectation value of S₁·S₂ for a symmetric state like |↑↑⟩ would be?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute directly.

Let me denote the basis states as |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩ for the first two spins. For each term in the first two spins of the given state, compute S₁·S₂.

First term in ψ: |↑↑↓⟩. The first two spins are |↑↑⟩. Let's compute S₁·S₂ on |↑↑⟩.

The operators S₁^z and S₂^z acting on |↑↑⟩ gives ( (ħ/2)^2 (1)(1) ) since both spins are up. The x and y components: S₁^x |↑⟩ is (ħ/2)(|↓⟩) and similarly for S₁^y (with an i factor, but squared terms would be positive). Wait, actually, the expectation value of S₁·S₂ in the state |↑↑⟩ is (S₁^x S₂^x + S₁^y S₂^y + S₁^z S₂^z) evaluated on |↑↑⟩.

Let me compute each term:

First, S₁^z S₂^z |↑↑⟩ = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4) |↑↑⟩.

Now, S₁^x S₂^x |↑↑⟩:

S₁^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓⟩, and similarly S₂^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩. Therefore:

S₁^x S₂^x |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓⟩. But in the state |↑↑⟩, this term would act as follows:

Wait, actually, S₁^x acts on the first spin, S₂^x on the second. So, applying S₁^x first to the first spin: S₁^x |↑₁⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓₁⟩, then S₂^x acts on |↑₂⟩ to give (ħ/2)|↓₂⟩. So the total is (ħ/2)^2 |↓₁↓₂⟩.

Similarly for S₁^y S₂^y, but with an i^2 = -1 factor, so it would be - (ħ/2)^2 |↓₁↓₂⟩.

Therefore, the total expectation value of S₁·S₂ on |↑↑⟩ is:

The sum of the three terms: S₁^z S₂^z term gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩, plus the S₁^x S₂^x term (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩, plus the S₁^y S₂^y term (-ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩.

Wait, actually, when you write S₁·S₂ as an operator, when acting on |↑↑⟩, you have to apply each term:

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value in |↑↑⟩:

⟨↑↑| S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑| [ (S₁^x S₂^x + S₁^y S₂^y + S₁^z S₂^z ) ] |↑↑⟩

Let me compute each term:

⟨↑↑| S₁^x S₂^x |↑↑⟩ = [⟨↑| S₁^x |↑⟩][⟨↑| S₂^x |↑⟩]^* since it's hermitian? Wait, maybe better to compute in components.

Wait, the operator S₁^x S₂^x acting on |↑↑⟩ is:

First, S₂^x acts on the second spin: S₂^x |↑₂⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓₂⟩, then S₁^x acts on first spin. But actually, operator order matters.

Wait, actually, the operator S₁^x S₂^x is S₁^x acting on the first spin and S₂^x on the second. So:

(S₁^x S₂^x)|↑↑⟩ = S₁^x |↑₁⟩ ⊗ S₂^x |↑₂⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓₁⟩ ⊗ (ħ/2)|↓₂⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓₁↓₂⟩.

Similarly, (S₁^y S₂^y)|↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 (-i)^2 |↓↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1)|↓↓⟩, because S^y has an i factor? Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices for y have an i in the off-diagonal elements, so maybe the components are with factors of i. Let me clarify.

The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]],

σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]],

σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So S^x = (ħ/2)σ_x,

S^y = (ħ/2)σ_y,

S^z = (ħ/2)σ_z.

Therefore, S₁^y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-i)|↓⟩,

and similarly S₂^y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(i)|↓⟩? Wait, no. Let me check:

For the first term, applying S₁^y to |↑₁⟩:

S₁^y |↑₁⟩ = (ħ/2)(σ_y) |↑₁⟩ = (ħ/2)(0*|↑₁⟩ + i|↓₁⟩ )

Wait, σ_y matrix acting on the first component (|↑⟩ is the first basis vector):

σ_y |↑⟩ = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [1; 0] = [ -i*0 ; i*1 ] ?

Wait, no, σ_y's matrix is first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0].

So multiplying by |↑⟩, which is a column vector [1; 0], gives [0; i]. So:

σ_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩.

Therefore, S^y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(i |↓⟩)

Similarly, S^y |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(σ_y |↓⟩ ) = (ħ/2)(-i |↑⟩ )

Therefore, S₁^y S₂^y |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2 i |↓₁⟩ ) ⊗ ( (ħ/2) i |↓₂⟩ )

Wait, let me do step by step:

S₁^y acts on |↑₁⟩: (ħ/2) i |↓₁⟩

S₂^y acts on |↑₂⟩: (ħ/2) i |↓₂⟩

Therefore, the product operator S₁^y S₂^y acting on |↑₁↑₂⟩ is (ħ/2)^2 (i * i) |↓₁↓₂⟩ = (ħ²/4)(i²)|↓₁↓₂⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1)|↓₁↓₂⟩.

Similarly, S₁^x S₂^x |↑↑⟩ is (ħ/2)^2 |↓₁↓₂⟩ as before.

Now, the S₁^z S₂^z term:

S₁^z |↑₁⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑₁⟩, so S₁^z S₂^z |↑₁↑₂⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑₁↑₂⟩.

So putting all three terms together for S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩:

S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (S₁^z S₂^z term) + (S₁^x S₂^x term) + (S₁^y S₂^y term )

= (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩

The x and y terms cancel out for the |↓↓⟩ parts?

Wait, no. Wait, the S₁^x S₂^x term gives (ħ²/4)|↓₁↓₂⟩, and the S₁^y S₂^y term gives - (ħ²/4)|↓₁↓₂⟩. Therefore, adding them cancels those terms, leaving only the S_zS_z term.

Therefore, S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ + (0 for the other terms).

Wait, no, the S_xS_x term contributes to |↓↓⟩, but the other terms don't interfere with |↑↑⟩. Wait, actually, the result is that:

Wait, no, actually, the total S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/4 - ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ ?

Wait, no, the S_x and S_y terms produce the |↓↓⟩ term, but they cancel each other?

Wait, the S_x term gives + (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ and the S_y gives - (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩, so they cancel. So the total is only the S_z term, so S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩.

So the expectation value ⟨↑↑|S₁·S₂|↑↑⟩ is (ħ²/4).

Wait, but that's only the expectation value when the state is |↑↑⟩. But in our case, the first term in ψ is |↑↑↓⟩, so S₁·S₂ acts on the first two spins as we found, giving (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩. So for the first term, when we apply S₁·S₂, it's (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, let's compute the action on the second term of ψ, which is |↑↓↑⟩. Let me consider S₁·S₂ acting on the first two spins here: the first spin is up, second is down. So the first two spins are |↑↓⟩. Let's compute S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩.

Again, breaking it into components:

First, S₁^z S₂^z |↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ/2)(↑₁) )*( (ħ/2)(↓₂) ) = ( (ħ/2)^2 )(+1/2)(-1/2) ? Wait, actually, in operator terms:

S₁^z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

S₂^z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩,

Therefore, S₁^z S₂^z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|↑↓⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

Then the other terms:

S₁^x S₂^x |↑↓⟩:

First, S₁^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩,

S₂^x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

Thus S₁^x S₂^x |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 (|↓⟩⊗|↑⟩) = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S₁^y S₂^y |↑↓⟩:

S₁^y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)i |↓⟩,

S₂^y |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-i)|↑⟩,

Thus, S₁^y S₂^y |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(i) |↓⟩ ⊗ (ħ/2)(-i)|↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(i)(-i)|↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(1)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, adding the x and y terms:

S₁^x S₂^x + S₁^y S₂^y contributes (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩.

Adding the z term:

Total S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩ = [ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ ] + (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩.

So the result of S₁·S₂ acting on the first two spins of the second term |↑↓↑⟩ is:

- (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ ⊗ |↑₃⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩ ⊗ |↑₃⟩.

Therefore, the second term in ψ, when acted upon by S₁·S₂, gives:

- (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, the third term in ψ is |↓↑↑⟩. Let's compute S₁·S₂ on |↓↑⟩ (first two spins):

First two spins are |↓↑⟩. Let's do the calculation:

S₁^z S₂^z |↓↑⟩ = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

S₁^x S₂^x |↓↑⟩:

S₁^x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩,

S₂^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩,

Thus S₁^x S₂^x |↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S₁^y S₂^y |↓↑⟩:

S₁^y |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-i)|↑⟩,

S₂^y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(i)|↓⟩,

Thus, S₁^y S₂^y |↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 (-i)(i)|↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(1)|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, the x and y terms give |↑↓⟩ with total ħ²/2, so:

Total S₁·S₂ |↓↑⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩.

Hence, acting on the third term |↓↑↑⟩, we get:

- (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

So now, compiling all three terms after applying S₁·S₂ to each term in ψ:

First term contribution:

(1/√3)(ħ²/4 |↑↑↓⟩ )

Second term contribution:

(1/√3)[ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ]

Third term contribution:

(1/√3)[ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩ ]

Now, let's add all these contributions together:

First term: (ħ²/4)(1/√3)|↑↑↓⟩.

Second term contributions: 

- (ħ²/4)(1/√3)|↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)(1/√3)|↓↑↑⟩.

Third term contributions:

- (ħ²/4)(1/√3)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)(1/√3)|↑↓↑⟩.

Now, let's combine the terms for |↑↓↑⟩:

The second term has - (ħ²/4) and the third term has + (ħ²/2). The coefficients add to (-1/4 + 1/2) = 1/4. So total coefficient for |↑↓↑⟩ is (1/4)(ħ²/√3).

Similarly for |↓↑↑⟩: the second term has +(ħ²/2) and the third term has -(ħ²/4). That sums to (1/2 - 1/4) = 1/4, so coefficient (1/4)(ħ²/√3).

The first term only has |↑↑↓⟩ with coefficient (1/4)(ħ²/√3).

Therefore, the total result of S₁·S₂ acting on ψ is:

(ħ²/(4√3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Which is exactly (ħ²/(4√3)) * ψ * √3 = (ħ²/4) ψ. Wait, let me check:

Wait, ψ is (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), so each term in the square brackets is √3 * ψ. Wait no:

Wait, the total is (ħ²/(4√3)) times the sum of the three terms, which is (ħ²/(4√3))*(√3 ψ), since the sum of the three terms is √3 ψ. Wait, actually, if you factor out 1/√3, then the sum |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ is √3 times ψ multiplied by √3? Hmm.

Alternatively, let me see:

The result is (ħ²/(4√3)) multiplied by ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = (ħ²/(4√3)) * (√3 ψ) because ψ is 1/√3 times those terms. So that would be (ħ²/4)*ψ.

Therefore, S₁·S₂ ψ = (ħ²/4) ψ.

Wait, so that's the result for S₁·S₂ acting on ψ. Similarly, due to the symmetry of the state, the same must hold for S₁·S₃ and S₂·S₃. Let's verify one of the others to be sure.

Let me check S₁·S₃. Since the state is symmetric under exchange of particles, the expectation value should be the same. But let's see.

Take S₁·S₃, which acts on particles 1 and 3. Let's compute S₁·S₃ acting on ψ.

Starting with the first term |↑↑↓⟩:

The first and third spins here are |↑₁⟩ and |↓₃⟩. So S₁·S₃ on |↑↑↓⟩ would act on |↑₁↓₃⟩.

Similarly to how we did for S₁·S₂, but now on spins 1 and 3.

Let me compute S₁·S₃ on the first term |↑↑↓⟩ (which is |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩):

So focusing on spins 1 and 3: |↑₁↓₃⟩. Let me compute S₁·S₃ |↑₁↓₃⟩.

Following similar steps:

First, S₁^z S₃^z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|↑↓⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

Then S₁^x S₃^x |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓₁↑₃⟩,

Similarly, S₁^y S₃^y |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 (-i)(i)|↓₁↑₃⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓₁↑₃⟩,

Therefore, adding the x and y terms gives (ħ²/2)|↓₁↑₃⟩,

So S₁·S₃ |↑₁↓₃⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, acting on |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩, the result is:

- (ħ²/4)|↑₂↑₁↓₃⟩ → Wait, need to track the full state. Let me do step by step:

The full state is |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩.

After applying S₁·S₃ to spins 1 and 3, we have:

First, the S_z term gives - (ħ²/4)|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩,

plus the x and y terms give (ħ²/2)|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩,

since S₁^x S₃^x flips the first spin to down and third to up, so the full state becomes |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩,

hence the total contribution is:

- (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, we can process the other terms in ψ. However, since the state is symmetric under permutation of particles, the action of S₁·S₃ on the entire ψ will be the same as S₁·S₂. Therefore, S₁·S₃ ψ = (ħ²/4) ψ,

and similarly S₂·S₃ ψ = (ħ²/4) ψ.

Hence, each term in H (which is A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃)) acts on ψ to give (ħ²/4)*ψ for each term. Therefore, adding them up:

H ψ = A*( (ħ²/4)ψ + (ħ²/4)ψ + (ħ²/4)ψ ) = A*( 3*(ħ²/4) ) ψ = (3Aħ²/4) ψ.

Wait, but the given answer is 2/3*Aħ². Hmm. There's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my calculation must have an error.

Wait, so according to this calculation, each S_i·S_j term gives a factor of (ħ²/4) when acting on ψ, so total Hψ = 3*(ħ²/4)*A ψ. So eigenvalue would be (3/4)*Aħ², but the problem states the answer is 2/3*Aħ². So clearly, I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, let me retrace.

First, in computing S₁·S₂ acting on |↑↑⟩, I concluded that S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩. But let me confirm that again:

When I calculated S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩, the S_xS_x and S_yS_y terms gave |↓↓⟩ which canceled. The S_z term gave (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩. So that's correct.

But when acting on the first term of ψ, which is |↑↑↓⟩, then S₁·S₂ gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, for the second term |↑↓↑⟩, S₁·S₂ gave a combination which, when summed over all terms, gave (ħ²/4)*ψ. Wait, but when I added the contributions from all three terms, I ended up with:

After S₁·S₂ acting on ψ gives (ħ²/(4√3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) which is (ħ²/4)*ψ because (1/√3)(sum terms) is ψ. Therefore, that part is correct.

So each term in H, which is the three S_i·S_j terms, each contribute (ħ²/4)*ψ, so total Hψ = 3*(ħ²/4)*A ψ = (3Aħ²/4)ψ.

But the answer is supposed to be (2/3 A ħ²). Hmm, so there's a problem here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of S₁·S₂ acting on the first term. Let me go back to the first term:

First term in ψ: |↑↑↓⟩. Then S₁·S₂ acting on first two spins gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩⊗|↓₃⟩, so that term is (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩. Correct.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩. S₁·S₂ acting on first two spins (↑↓) gives:

We had:

- (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩⊗|↑₃⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩⊗|↑₃⟩.

So the first part is - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩,

and second part is (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩, S₁·S₂ acting on first two spins (↓↑) gives:

- (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩⊗|↑₃⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩⊗|↑₃⟩,

Wait, actually, let me redo the third term:

Wait, the third term in ψ is |↓↑↑⟩, so spins 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩. When applying S₁·S₂ on spins 1 and 2:

We had earlier:

S₁·S₂ |↓↑⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S₁·S₂ acting on the full term |↓↑↑⟩ gives:

- (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

Thus, the contributions are:

First term: (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩,

Second term: - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩,

Third term: - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

Adding all together:

For |↑↑↓⟩: (ħ²/4),

For |↑↓↑⟩: [ - (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/2) ] comes from second and third terms.

Similarly for |↓↑↑⟩: [ (ħ²/2) - (ħ²/4) ] comes from second and third terms.

Therefore:

Coefficient of |↑↑↓⟩: (ħ²/4),

Coefficient of |↑↓↑⟩: ( -1/4 + 1/2 ) = (1/4). So (ħ²/4),

Coefficient of |↓↑↑⟩: (1/2 -1/4)=1/4, so (ħ²/4).

Thus, each term has coefficient (ħ²/4), so total is (ħ²/4)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = (ħ²/4)(√3 ψ) * (1/√3) ? Wait, no.

Wait, the total is (ħ²/4)(each term with coefficient 1). The original ψ is (1/√3)(each term). So the total result is (ħ²/4) times the sum of the terms, which is (ħ²/4)*(√3)*(ψ)*√3? Wait no, let me think differently.

The total of the terms is:

(ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

But that sum is exactly √3*(ψ) * sqrt(3)? Wait, ψ is (1/√3)(sum of terms). Therefore, the sum is √3 ψ. Therefore,

Total is (ħ²/4)*(√3 ψ). Therefore, S₁·S₂ ψ = (ħ²/4)*(√3)ψ / √3 ?

Wait, no, actually:

The total sum ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) is equal to √3 * (ψ) * sqrt(3)? No, ψ is (1/√3)*(sum). So the sum is √3 ψ. So the total S₁·S₂ ψ is (ħ²/4)*(√3 ψ), but actually, the total of the terms in the brackets is (sum of |...⟩), so S₁·S₂ acting on ψ is (ħ²/4) multiplied by the sum of those terms, which is (ħ²/4)*(√3 |ψ⟩ )?

Wait:

Wait, if the sum is ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), and ψ is (1/√3)( that sum ), then that sum is √3 ψ. Therefore,

S₁·S₂ ψ = (ħ²/4) * (sum terms) = (ħ²/4)*(√3 ψ). Wait but ψ is (1/√3)(sum terms), so:

Wait, no. Let me note that:

ψ = (1/√3)(A), where A is the sum of the three terms. Then S₁·S₂ ψ = (ħ²/4) A = (ħ²/4)(√3 ψ * sqrt(3)/sqrt(3))? Hmm, confusion here.

Let me think numerically:

Let me denote:

Let S₁·S₂ ψ = (ħ²/4)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given spin state psi is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). If it is, I need to find the energy eigenvalue; if not, compute the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*hbar², but I need to verify this.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators Si·Sj are given by (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2S_i·S_j) or something else? Wait, actually, Si·Sj is the scalar product of the spin vectors. Since each spin is 1/2, the scalar product operator is (S1·S2) = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z). Similarly for the other terms. 

Alternatively, there's a formula that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i² + S_j²)/2. Since for spin 1/2, S_i² = (3/4)ħ² for each particle. So maybe we can use that identity to rewrite the Hamiltonian?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H in the given state psi. Let me think. Since the state is symmetric in the spins, maybe it's an eigenstate?

First, let me note that the given state is psi = 1/sqrt(3) [up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3]. So, the three terms correspond to each particle having one down spin, and the others up. So the total spin is... Hmm, maybe the total spin S_total is important here? Let me see.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is a sum of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3. Each term is a scalar product between two spins. For spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j for two spins can be calculated if we know their states. Since the state is a superposition of all three possible configurations where exactly one spin is down and the other two are up. Each term in the Hamiltonian involves two particles, so let's see how each term acts on the state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H in psi. Let's proceed step by step.

First, note that the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, the expectation value <H> = A* [<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>].

So, I need to compute each of these three expectation values and add them up. Since the state is symmetric in the particles, all three terms should have the same expectation value, so I can compute <S1·S2> and multiply by 3, then times A. Let's confirm symmetry first.

Looking at the state psi, it's symmetric under exchange of particles 1, 2, or 3. For example, swapping particles 1 and 2, the terms become down1 up2 up3 (originally the last term) and up1 down2 up3 (the second term) and the first term becomes up2 up1 down3 which is the same as up1 up2 down3. Wait, actually, each term is cyclically permuted. Since the state is 1/sqrt(3) times (up1up2down3 + up1down2up3 + down1up2up3), swapping two particles will permute the three terms cyclically, but the overall state remains the same up to a phase. Since all coefficients are equal and real, the state is symmetric under permutation of particles. Therefore, all three terms <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3> should be equal. So I just need to compute one of them and multiply by 3.

So let's compute <S1·S2>. Since the expectation value is linear, we can compute it term by term for each component of the state, then add them up and divide by sqrt(3)^2=3.

Let me write psi as:

psi = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term is a product state of the three particles. Let me denote the basis states as |s1 s2 s3⟩ where si is ↑ or ↓.

First, note that S1·S2 acting on the three-particle state will act only on the first two spins. The third spin is unaffected. Similarly, S1·S3 acts on the first and third, etc.

So, to compute <S1·S2>, let's look at each term in the superposition and see what S1·S2 does.

First term: |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1·S2 on this term.

In the standard basis (eigenstates of S_z for each particle), the S1·S2 operator can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, the scalar product S_i · S_j is (3/4) if the two spins are aligned, and (-1/4) if opposite? Wait, actually, let me recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state |↑↑⟩ is (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩ = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)|↑↑⟩.

Since S_z |↑⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑⟩, so S1z S2z |↑↑⟩ = ( (1/2)ħ )^2 |↑↑⟩. Similarly, S1x and S1y on |↑⟩ will have terms involving |↓⟩, but when acting on |↑↑⟩, the cross terms might vanish?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value directly. Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a given state can be calculated.

In the state |↑↑⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩ = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)|↑↑⟩.

Compute each term:

S1z S2z |↑↑⟩ = ( (ħ/2)(ħ/2) ) |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩

S1x S2x |↑↑⟩: S1x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(|↓⟩), so S1x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, similarly S2x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩. Therefore,

S1x S2x |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(-i)|↓↓⟩? Wait, hold on, actually, the Pauli matrices in terms of operators:

The Sx operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, similarly for Sy and Sz. So S1x = (ħ/2) σ_x ⊗ I, S2x = (ħ/2) I ⊗ σ_x. So S1x S2x is (ħ²/4) σ_x ⊗ σ_x on the first two spins.

Similarly, so applying S1x S2x to |↑↑⟩:

σ_x |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σ_x |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so (σ_x ⊗ σ_x)|↑↑⟩ = |↓⟩⊗|↓⟩. Therefore,

S1x S2x |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩. Similarly for S1y S2y. Let's compute S1y S2y:

σ_y |↑⟩ = -i|↓⟩, so (σ_y ⊗ σ_y)|↑↑⟩ = (σ_y |↑⟩)⊗(σ_y |↑⟩) = (-i|↓⟩) ⊗ (-i|↓⟩) = (-i)^2 |↓↓⟩ = -|↓↓⟩. Therefore,

S1y S2y |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1)|↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1z S2z |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩. So adding up the three components:

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)|↑↑⟩

= (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ + (-ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩

= (0) |↓↓⟩ + (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩.

Wait, that's only the S_z term. Wait, hold on, let me recalculate:

Wait S1x S2x gives (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩,

S1y S2y gives (ħ²/4)(-1)|↓↓⟩,

So S1x S2x + S1y S2y = (ħ²/4 - ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩ = 0,

So then S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ + 0.

Wait, so actually the cross terms canceled out. So the total is (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩.

So the expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↑↓⟩ is the inner product of the state with S1·S2 applied to it. Since the third spin is down, but the operator S1·S2 doesn't act on the third spin. So if we have the state |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value is the same as for the first two spins in |↑↑⟩, so it's (1/4)ħ².

Wait, but in the full three-particle state, the S1·S2 operator acts non-trivially only on the first two particles. So when we compute <S1·S2>, we can consider the first two spins and trace out the third? Wait, but here the entire state is a pure state, so the expectation value would be the sum over all terms of the expectation over each term.

Alternatively, perhaps more straightforwardly:

For the term |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acting on this gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩, so the expectation value contribution from this term is (1/3)* <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓> + cross terms? Wait, but expectation value is linear over the entire state. Let me actually compute <psi | H | psi>, but let's first compute <S1·S2>.

Wait, let me think of it this way:

The expectation value <S1·S2> in the state psi is:

<psi|S1·S2|psi> = (1/3)[ <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↓↑> + <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↓↑↑> + similar terms for each term in the superposition].

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, maybe compute the expectation value for each term in the superposition and then average.

Wait, actually, psi is a normalized state, so the expectation value of S1·S2 is:

1/3 [ <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓> + <↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑> + cross terms ]

Hmm, but cross terms will involve products of different basis states. It might be better to compute each term.

Alternatively, since all terms are symmetric, maybe each of the three basis states gives the same expectation value? Wait not exactly. Let me see:

Take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩

Compute S1·S2 acting on this: as above, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, the second term: |↑↓↑⟩

Here, the first and third spins are up, second is down. So S1·S2 acts on first and second (which is down). Let's compute S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩:

First, S1·S2 will act on the first two spins |↑↓⟩. Let's compute S1·S2 on |↑↓⟩.

Again, using the earlier approach:

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)|↑↓⟩

Compute each term:

S1x S2x |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(σ_x⊗σ_x)|↑↓⟩. 

σ_x |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, σ_x |↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩⊗|↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩

Thus S1x S2x |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩. Similarly,

S1y S2y |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(σ_y⊗σ_y)|↑↓⟩. 

σ_y |↑⟩ = -i|↓⟩, σ_y |↓⟩ = i|↑⟩, so σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ = (-i|↓⟩)⊗(i|↑⟩) = (-i)(i)|↓↑⟩ = (1)|↓↑⟩. Therefore,

S1y S2y |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Then S1z S2z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓⟩ because S1z |↑⟩ is (ħ/2)|↑⟩, S2z |↓⟩ is (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, so the product is (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) |↑↓⟩ = -ħ²/4 |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, adding all components:

S1x S2x term: (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

S1y S2y term: (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

S1z S2z term: (-ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, total S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩

= (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ (since the third spin is up, it's just |↑⟩ in the tensor product) is:

[ (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ ] ⊗ |↑⟩

= (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩.

Therefore, the expectation value contribution from the second term |↑↓↑⟩ when we compute <↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑> would be:

<↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑> = <↑↓↑| [ (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ ]

= (ħ²/2) <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> - (ħ²/4) <↑↓↑|↑↓↑>

The first term is zero because <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> is 0 (the states differ in the first spin: first is ↑ vs ↓). The second term is - (ħ²/4) * 1.

Therefore, <↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑> = - (ħ²/4).

Similarly, the third term in psi is |↓↑↑⟩, so let's compute <↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑>.

First, S1·S2 acts on the first two spins |↓↑⟩:

Compute S1·S2 |↓↑⟩.

Again, similar to the previous steps:

S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z)|↓↑⟩.

Compute each term:

S1x S2x |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(σ_x⊗σ_x)|↓↑⟩

σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

Thus S1x S2x |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

S1y S2y |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(σ_y⊗σ_y)|↓↑⟩.

σ_y |↓⟩ = i|↑⟩, σ_y |↑⟩ = -i|↓⟩, so σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = (i|↑⟩)⊗(-i|↓⟩) = ( -i² ) |↑↓⟩ = (1)|↑↓⟩.

Hence S1y S2y |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

S1z S2z |↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Adding up the terms:

S1x S2x + S1y S2y gives (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩,

plus S1z S2z term: - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

Thus total S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = [ (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ ] ⊗ |↑⟩,

Wait, actually, the third spin is |↑⟩, so:

Wait, the full state is |↓↑↑⟩, so the first two spins are |↓↑⟩, third is |↑⟩.

So S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = [ (ħ²/2)|↑↓⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ ] ⊗ |↑⟩,

So when calculating the expectation value <↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑>:

= <↓↑↑| [ (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ ]

The first term is (ħ²/2) <↓↑↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 0 (since first spin is ↓ vs ↑),

Second term is - (ħ²/4) <↓↑↑|↓↑↑> = - (ħ²/4).

Therefore, <↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑> = - (ħ²/4).

So putting this all together, for each of the three basis states in psi:

1. For |↑↑↓⟩: <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4)

2. For |↑↓↑⟩: < here > = - (ħ²/4)

3. For |↓↑↑⟩: same as above, also - (ħ²/4)

Therefore, the total expectation value of S1·S2 in psi is (1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ]

Wait, let's compute:

Each term is:

First term contribution: (1/3)*(ħ²/4)

Second term: (1/3)*(-ħ²/4)

Third term: (1/3)*(-ħ²/4)

Adding them up: (1/3)*( (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ² ) = (1/3)*( -1/4 ħ² ) = - (1/12) ħ²

Wait, that gives a negative value, but that can't be right? Wait, but let's check calculations again.

Wait, in the first term, <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓> was (ħ²/4), right? Because S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩, so the inner product is (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓> squared, so it's (ħ²/4) * 1 (since the state is normalized).

Wait, actually, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recast the problem:

When we have a term like |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 in that term is (S1·S2 |↑↑↓>, which is (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩, so the expectation value contribution is (1/3)* (⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩) = (1/3)*(ħ²/4).

For the second term |↑↓↑⟩, the expectation value contribution is (1/3)* ⟨↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩ = (1/3)*(-ħ²/4).

Similarly for the third term, also (1/3)*(-ħ²/4).

So total is (1/3)(ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4) = (1/3)(-ħ²/4) = -ħ²/(12).

Hmm, that gives a negative value for <S1·S2>, but the other terms in the Hamiltonian like S1·S3 and S2·S3 would contribute similarly? Wait, but let's check S1·S3 instead.

Wait a second, maybe we have a mistake here. Let me check the calculation for the second term again. For |↑↓↑⟩, which is the second term in the superposition, the first particle is up, second down, third up. So when we act S1·S2 on this state, we get:

Wait, the operator is S1·S2, so acts on the first and second particles. The first is up, second is down.

As calculated above, S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ gives us (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩, so when you compute the expectation value, the inner product with |↑↓⟩ is:

(ħ²/2) * ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4) * ⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩.

But ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ is zero, because the first spin is up vs down, second down vs up. So the first term is zero. The second term is - (ħ²/4) * 1. So that gives -ħ²/(4). So that part is correct.

Similarly for the third term, the result is also -ħ²/(4). So overall, the total expectation value is indeed (1/3)( ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 ) = - ħ²/(12). That seems correct. Hmm, but this is odd because the total Hamiltonian would then have expectation value A*( -ħ²/12 - ħ²/12 - ħ²/12 ) ?

Wait, no, hold on. Wait the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, the expectation value is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ). 

Earlier, I assumed that all three terms would have the same expectation value because of permutation symmetry. Let me confirm whether that is true.

Because the state is symmetric under permutation of all three particles, the expectation values should indeed be equal. So since <S1·S2> = -ħ²/(12), then each of the three terms would also be -ħ²/(12). Therefore, the total expectation value would be A*(3*(-ħ²/12)) = A*(-ħ²/4), but this contradicts the given answer. Wait, but the supposed answer is positive 2/3 Aħ². So something is wrong here.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back. Wait, let's recast the problem using another approach, perhaps using total spin.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state |↑↑↓⟩. Let me check again.

Wait, for the first term |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins are |↑↑⟩. Therefore, S1·S2 acting on the first two spins is (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩.

Earlier, I computed that S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩. Therefore, the expectation value for that term is (ħ²/4) times the norm squared, so yes, that part is correct. Then in the second term, when the first and second spins are |↑↓⟩, then S1·S2 gives us the terms which resulted in -ħ²/4. So that's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the entire three-particle system's total spin. Let me think about that.

The given state is symmetric under particle exchange, so it must be an eigenstate of the permutation operators. Since the Hamitonian is also symmetric under exchange, the operator commutes with permutation, so the state should be an eigenstate? Hmm, not necessarily. Wait, the Hamiltonian is symmetric, so if the state is symmetric, then it might be an eigenstate, but not necessarily unless it's an eigenvector of the symmetric operator in the symmetric subspace. Alternatively, maybe in the symmetric subspace, the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized, and we need to see if this state is an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total spin operators. Let me think in terms of total spin.

The total spin operator squared is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since each spin is 1/2, S1² = S2² = S3² = 3/4 ħ². Therefore, S² = 3*(3/4 ħ²) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, rearranged:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S² - 9/4 ħ²).

Therefore, if we can compute the expectation value of S² in the given state, then we can compute <H>.

This might be easier. Let me try that.

So, <H> = (A/2)( <S²> - 9/4 ħ² ). So if I can compute <S²> for the given state.

To compute <S²>, we need the total spin squared of the state. Let me see what the total spin is for the given state.

The given state is a symmetric combination of three states each with two up and one down spin. Let me note that for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me see.

The state psi is symmetric, so it must be a part of the symmetric subspace. Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (symmetric) or 1/2 (antisymmetric?), but actually, the symmetry isn't directly the same as the total spin. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the possible total spins.

In the case of three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric combination of three particles with two up and one down would form part of the total spin 1/2 representation. Alternatively, let's see:

The state given is:

psi = 1/√3 ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

This is actually the same as the state with exactly one down spin. So when you have three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be calculated by adding the individual spins. 

Each of the states in the superposition has two up and one down spin. The total spin for each term would be similar. Let me compute the total spin for such a state.

Take for example |↑↑↓⟩. The total spin of this state can be calculated by first adding spins 1 and 2, which are both up, so their total spin is 1 (since 1/2 +1/2=1). Then adding the third spin (down).

Adding spin 1 (total S=1) with spin 3 (S=1/2). The possible total spins are 3/2 or 1/2.

The state |↑↑↓⟩ can be rewritten as |↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩. First, |↑↑⟩ is the triplet state (S=1, m_S=+1). Then adding the third spin (which is down, so m_S=-1/2), the total spin could be S=3/2 with m_S=1 - 1/2 = 1/2, or S=1/2 with m_S=1 - 1/2 -1 = ? Wait, actually, maybe better to use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the total spin of the three spins with one down and two up is actually 1/2. Let me think. For three particles, each with spin 1/2:

The possible total spins are 3/2, 1/2, 1/2, 3/2 for combinations with different numbers of up spins? Wait, actually, perhaps when you have an odd number of particles, the total spin can be half-integer.

Wait, let me recall: For three spin 1/2 particles:

The total spin can be 3/2 (all aligned) or 1/2 (with one opposite). So in the case where two are up and one down, the total spin is 1/2.

Similarly, for one up and two down, also total spin 1/2. If all are up or all down, total spin 3/2.

Therefore, the state given here, which has two up and one down, must be a total spin 1/2 state. Since all three terms in the superposition have two up and one down, the total spin is 1/2.

Therefore, S² for this state is (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, <S²> = 3/4 ħ².

Hence, substituting into the expression for H:

<H> = (A/2)(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)( -6/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)( -3/2 ħ² ) = -3/4 A ħ².

Wait, but this contradicts the supposed answer of 2/3 A ħ². There's a problem here. Maybe my assumption that the total spin is 1/2 is wrong?

Wait, let's verify the total spin. Let's compute S² for the given state.

The state is a symmetric combination of three states with one down spin. Let me think of it as the state with one down spin. To compute the total spin, perhaps we can think of the state as the totally symmetric combination of the three particles with exactly one down spin. 

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue (S(S+1))ħ² where S is 1? Wait, no, S must be 3/2 or 1/2 in three particles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the total spin. Let me compute S² for the given state.

The state is symmetric. To compute S², let's note that S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding this gives S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already know S1² = S2² = S3² = 3/4 ħ², so each term contributes 3/4 ħ². So the total of these three terms is 9/4 ħ².

Then the cross terms, 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S² = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then S² = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(H/A).

Therefore, solving for H:

H = (A/2)(S² - 9/4 ħ²).

So if I can compute <S²>, then I can compute <H>.

Now, let's compute <S²> for the given state. Since the state is symmetric and has two up, one down spins, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the total spin is indeed 1/2, as I thought earlier, leading to S(S+1) = 3/4, so <S²> = 3/4 ħ², which would give H as (A/2)(3/4 - 9/4)ħ² = (A/2)(-6/4)ħ² = -3/4 A ħ². But the correct answer is supposed to be positive 2/3 A ħ². Hmm. Clearly discrepancy here. So I must have made an error in assuming the total spin.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that the total spin of the state is 1/2. Let me actually compute S² acting on the state.

Let me compute S² |ψ>.

Since S² is a scalar operator, it commutes with permutations, so since |ψ> is symmetric, the result should also be symmetric, so it's an eigenstate. Let me compute the action of S² on the state.

First, note that S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding:

S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2S1·S2 + 2S1·S3 + 2S2·S3.

So, when acting on |ψ>, S² |ψ> = (9/4 ħ²) |ψ> + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|ψ>,

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so this can be written as:

S² |ψ> = (9/4 ħ²)|ψ> + (2/A)* H |ψ>.

But if H |ψ> = E |ψ>, then S² |ψ> = (9/4 ħ² + 2E/A ) |ψ>.

But also, S² is a Hermitian operator, so it has eigenvalues. Let me see what the possible eigenvalues can be for this state.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute S² directly on the state.

Let me compute S² |ψ>.

Expressed as S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 acting on each term of |ψ>.

Take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

First, compute S1 + S2 + S3 in terms of their components. Since the state is in z-basis, let me consider the z-components.

The operator S_z = (S1_z + S2_z + S3_z). The square of S² includes more terms, but perhaps it's easier to compute S² as (S1 + S2 +
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The given state is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what the energy is. The answer is supposed to be an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*ħ², but I need to verify that.

First, I should recall that the spin operators for each particle can be written in terms of Pauli matrices, but maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without getting bogged down in matrix multiplication. Since the state is a combination of three basis states, each with two spin-ups and one spin-down, maybe there's some symmetry here. The state is symmetric under permutations of the first three particles? Wait, actually, let me see: the first term is up1, up2, down3; second is up1, down2, up3; third is down1, up2, up3. So each term has exactly two spin-ups and one spin-down, but in different positions. So the state is symmetric in that sense. That might be useful.

The Hamiltonian involves the scalar products of the spin operators between each pair. For spin 1/2 particles, the scalar product S_i·S_j is equal to 1/4 (S_i + S_j)^2 - 1/4 (S_i - S_j)^2, but maybe more straightforwardly, since S_i·S_j = (S_i_x S_j_x + S_i_y S_j_y + S_i_z S_j_z). Alternatively, since for spin 1/2, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2). Wait, actually, let me recall the formula correctly. The scalar product can be written as S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2)/2. Hmm, but maybe I should just work in the z-basis since the state is written in terms of up and down states.

Alternatively, since we need to compute the expectation value of H in the given state, which might be the same as checking if it's an eigenstate. So maybe let's compute H psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

First, let's note that each term in H is a product of pairs of spins. Since the Hamiltonian is linear in each of these terms, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Each term like S1·S2 acts on the first and second particles, etc.

Given that psi is a symmetrized state with two up spins and one down, maybe each of the terms S_i·S_j will act similarly on each pair. Let me see: since the state is symmetric under permutations, perhaps each term will have the same contribution.

Alternatively, let's consider each term in the Hamiltonian separately. Let's first compute the expectation value of S1·S2, then S1·S3, then S2·S3, and add them up, multiplied by A. Since the state is symmetric, maybe all three terms have the same expectation value, so we can just compute one and multiply by three.

First, let's compute <S1·S2>. To compute this, we can note that in the given state, the particles are in a symmetric combination where each pair has either both spins up, one up and one down, or both down? Wait, actually, looking at the terms in psi:

The three basis states are:

1. up1 up2 down3

2. up1 down2 up3

3. down1 up2 up3

So, in the first state, S1 is up, S2 is up, so S1·S2 would be the product of their spin operators. But in the z-component, which is the most straightforward to compute since the states are eigenstates of S_z.

Wait, actually, S_i·S_j is a scalar operator, which can be written as the sum of the three components. The expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each component. However, in the given state, which is a combination of states with definite spin-z, the expectation value of S_i^z S_j^z is straightforward. But the x and y components might be more complicated. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in each of the basis states and then combine.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that for spin 1/2 particles, S_i·S_j has eigenvalues depending on the total spin of the pair. For example, if the pair is in a singlet state, S_i·S_j = -3ħ²/4, and if they are in a triplet state, S_i·S_j = +ħ²/4. Wait, is that right?

Let me recall the formula for the expectation value of S_i·S_j. The operator S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin of the two particles. If we consider two spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The operator S1·S2 can be written as (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Since S1^2 = 3ħ²/4 and S2^2 = 3ħ²/4 for each spin 1/2 particle, so S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2/2 - 3ħ²/4. Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 for a state with total spin S is then (S(S+1)ħ² - 3ħ²/2)/2? Wait, let me recast:

The total spin squared (S1 + S2)^2 is S(S+1)ħ² for S=0 or 1. So substituting back, S1·S2 = [S(S+1)ħ² - (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4)] / 2 = [S(S+1)ħ² - 3ħ²/2]/2. 

Therefore, for S=1 (triplet), the expectation value is [2ħ² - 3ħ²/2]/2 = [ (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 ] / 2 = (ħ²/2)/2 = ħ²/4.

For S=0 (singlet), it's [0 - 3ħ²/2]/2 = -3ħ²/4.

Therefore, the expectation value of S_i·S_j between two spins is either +ħ²/4 (if they are in triplet) or -3ħ²/4 (if in singlet).

So, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the given state. Since the state is a combination of three terms, each of which has different configurations for the spins of particles 1 and 2.

Let me look at each of the three basis states:

First term: up1 up2 down3. In this term, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their total spin is 1 (since they are both up, which is part of the triplet state). Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in this state is +ħ²/4.

Second term: up1 down2 up3. Here, particles 1 and 2 are in up and down. So their total spin is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet)? Wait, up and down can be either a singlet or triplet?

Wait, particles 1 and 2 in states up and down are in a singlet state? Let's see. The singlet state is (up1 down2 - down1 up2)/sqrt(2), so the combination up1 down2 is part of both the singlet and triplet? Hmm. Wait, actually, the product state up1 down2 has a total spin of 0 or 1?

If two spin-1/2 particles are in a product state like up and down, their total spin can be either 1 or 0, but the product states are not eigenstates of the total spin. Wait, actually, the total spin will have to be calculated.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Since in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so that's a triplet (since they are parallel). In the second term, they are up and down, so their total spin could be either 1 or 0. Hmm, so maybe I need to compute the expectation value in that basis.

Alternatively, maybe compute the expectation value <S1·S2> for each of the three terms, then sum them with the coefficients.

The given state is psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So, let's compute <S1·S2> for each term:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. For particles 1 and 2, both up, so S1·S2 term here is (S1·S2)^z + (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y). But in the z-basis, only the z-components contribute to the expectation value unless we consider cross terms. Wait, maybe I should instead note that in the z-basis, the expectation value of S1·S2 is the sum over the components. Since each spin has S_i^z = ± ħ/2. For the first term, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their S_i^z is +ħ/2 each, so their S1_z S2_z is (+ħ/2)(+ħ/2) = ħ²/4. The other components, like S1_x S2_x, etc., might be computable as well. Alternatively, since the expectation value of S1·S2 can also be found using the formula:

For two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a state with spins 1 and 2 in states |a⟩ and |b⟩ is (3/4 ħ²) * [ (a_z b_z) + (a_x b_x + a_y b_y) ]? Not sure, maybe better to use the eigenvalues.

Wait, S1·S2 is an operator in the Hilbert space of the first two particles, so perhaps it's easier to compute its matrix elements in the basis of those two particles. Since each particle has spin 1/2, the two-particle space is 4-dimensional. The states |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩. 

The operator S1·S2 in the z basis can be written as:

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

The expectation value of S1·S2 in the state |↑↑⟩ is:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) ] in this state. Since in |↑↑⟩, S1^z and S2^z are both +ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z is (ħ/2)^2. The other terms, S1^x and S1^y on |↑↑⟩: the spin-up state in z has S_x and S_y components which when acting on |↑⟩ give terms involving |↓⟩, but since the state is |↑↑⟩, applying S1^x or S1^y would take |↑⟩ to |↓⟩ or something, but multiplied by S2^x or S2^y, which would then annihilate the second spin's expectation? Hmm, maybe this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, recall that S1·S2 has eigenvalues ±3ħ²/4 and +ħ²/4, but perhaps the expectation value in a product state can be calculated as follows.

The expectation value of S1·S2 in the product state |↑1↑2⟩ is:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨↑1↑2| (S1·S2) |↑1↑2⟩

The operator S1·S2 includes S1^z S2^z, which in this case is ( (ħ/2)(ħ/2) ) = ħ²/4. Similarly, the x and y components. Since in the z basis, S^x and S^y can be written in terms of raising and lowering operators. Let me recall that S^x = (S_+ + S_-)/2 and similar for S^y.

But maybe an easier way is to note that for two spin-1/2 particles:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (⟨↑|S1_z|↑⟩)(⟨↑|S2_z|↑⟩) + ⟨↑|S1_x|↑⟩⟨↑|S2_x|↑⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_y|↑⟩⟨↑|S2_y|↑⟩

But S_x and S_y of a spin-up state in z are both zero? Wait no, actually the operators S_x and S_y do not vanish on |↑⟩. Wait, the expectation value <↑|S_x|↑> is zero because S_x is hermitian and its expectation in the z basis is zero. Similarly for S_y. So the cross terms (x and y components) will be zero in expectation for the product state |↑↑⟩, because each individual expectation of S_x is zero.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑|S1·S2|↑↑⟩ = ( (ħ/2)^2 + 0 + 0 ) = ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the state |↑↓⟩, then:

⟨↑↓|S1·S2|↑↓⟩ = ( (⟨↑|S1_z|↑⟩)(⟨↓|S2_z|↓⟩) + ⟨↑|S1_x|↑⟩⟨↓|S2_x|↓⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_y|↑⟩⟨↓|S2_y|↓⟩ )

Again, the x and y components would have zero expectation because <↑|S_x|↑> = 0 and <↓|S_x|↓> = 0. So only the z-component contributes:

( (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) ) = -ħ²/4.

Wait but hold on, actually, S_x and S_y operators might not necessarily vanish in the product state. Let me think again. For example, ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ = (1/2)⟨↑| (S_+ + S_-)|↑⟩ = (1/2)(⟨↑|S_+|↑⟩ + ⟨↑|S_-|↑⟩). Since S_+|↑⟩ = 0 and S_-|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|S_-|↑⟩ = 0. Therefore, ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ = 0. Similarly, S_y would also give zero. So yes, the cross terms (x and y) in the product state would vanish. So the total expectation value in |↑↓⟩ is just -ħ²/4.

Wait but hold on, for the cross terms like S1_x S2_x, it's (S1_x)(S2_x). The expectation value is ⟨↑|S1_x|↑⟩⟨↓|S2_x|↓⟩ = 0 * 0 = 0? Wait, actually, expectation of S1_x S2_x in the state |↑↓⟩ would be ⟨↑|S1_x|↑⟩⟨↓|S2_x|↓⟩, but since ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ is zero and ⟨↓|S_x|↓⟩ is also zero? Wait, actually, ⟨↓|S_x|↓⟩ would be similar. Let me check:

⟨↓|S_x|↓⟩ = (1/2)⟨↓| (S_+ + S_-)|↓⟩ = (1/2)(⟨↓|S_+|↓⟩ + ⟨↓|S_-|↓⟩). Here, S_+|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|S_+|↓⟩ = 0, and S_-|↓⟩ = 0, so ⟨↓|S_-|↓⟩ = 0. So yes, both are zero. So the cross terms indeed vanish.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the product state |↑↓⟩ is just the z-component, which is -ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the state |↓↑⟩, the expectation value would be the same as |↑↓⟩, so also -ħ²/4. 

Finally, the state |↓↓⟩ would give ⟨↓↓|S1·S2|↓↓⟩ = ( (-ħ/2)^2 + 0 + 0 ) = ħ²/4.

Therefore, putting this together:

In the given state psi, which is (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), we can compute <S1·S2>.

Let me compute each term's contribution:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. Here, S1 and S2 are |↑⟩ and |↑⟩, so their expectation of S1·S2 is ħ²/4.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩. Here, S1 is |↑⟩, S2 is |↓⟩, so their expectation is -ħ²/4.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩. Here, S1 is |↓⟩, S2 is |↑⟩, so again, their expectation is -ħ²/4.

Therefore, the total expectation value <S1·S2> for the entire state is (1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ] = (1/3)[ (ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4) ] = (1/3)(-ħ²/4) = -ħ²/12.

Wait, that's negative? Hmm, but the question states that the answer is positive. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, but hold on, the third term is |↓↑↑⟩, so particles 2 and 3 are up, but S1 is down and S2 is up, so S1 and S2 in that term are |↓⟩ and |↑⟩, so that's like |↓↑⟩, so their expectation value is -ħ²/4. So yes, that's correct. So adding up the three terms gives (1/3)(ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4) = -½ * ħ²/4? Wait, let's recalculate:

Wait first term contribution: 1/3 * (1/4)ħ²,

Second term contribution: 1/3 * (-1/4)ħ²,

Third term contribution: 1/3 * (-1/4)ħ²,

So total: (1/3)( (1/4) - (1/4) - (1/4) )ħ² = (1/3)(-1/4)ħ² = -1/12 ħ².

Hmm, so that's the expectation value of S1·S2. But since the state is symmetric, the expectation values of S1·S3 and S2·S3 should be the same?

Let me check S1·S3. 

To compute <S1·S3> in the state psi.

Again, the three terms:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 is up, 3 is down. So S1 and S3 are up and down, so their expectation is -ħ²/4.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 and 3 are up and up. Wait, no, particles 1 is up, 2 is down, 3 is up. So S1 and S3 are both up. So their expectation is ħ²/4.

Wait, let me clarify:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩: S1 is up, S3 is down. So S1·S3 between them would be like |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so -ħ²/4.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩: S1 is up, S3 is up. So their expectation is +ħ²/4.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩: S1 is down, S3 is up. So S1·S3 is -ħ²/4 (since down and up).

Therefore, the contributions:

First term: 1/3*(-ħ²/4),

Second term: 1/3*(+ħ²/4),

Third term: 1/3*(-ħ²/4),

Total expectation value: (1/3)( -1/4 + 1/4 -1/4 )ħ² = (1/3)( -1/4 )ħ² = same as before, -1/12 ħ².

Similarly for S2·S3.

Let me compute <S2·S3>.

First term: |↑↑↓⟩: S2 is up, S3 is down. So their expectation is -ħ²/4.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩: S2 is down, S3 is up. So their expectation is -ħ²/4.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩: S2 is up, S3 is up. Their expectation is +ħ²/4.

Therefore contributions:

First term: 1/3*(-1/4)ħ²,

Second term: 1/3*(-1/4)ħ²,

Third term: 1/3*(1/4)ħ²,

Adding up: ( -1/12 -1/12 + 1/12 )ħ² = ( -1/12 )ħ².

Therefore, all three terms S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 each have expectation value of -1/12 ħ².

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*( (-1/12) + (-1/12) + (-1/12) ) ħ² = A*(-3/12)ħ² = -A*(1/4)ħ².

But the question says the answer is 2/3*Aħ². That's a discrepancy. So either I messed up the calculations, or perhaps the state is an eigenstate. But according to this, the expectation value is -1/4 A ħ². Hmm.

Wait, but this contradicts the given answer. So where did I go wrong?

Let me check my calculation again step by step.

First, compute <S1·S2>:

First term |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, so S1·S2 expectation is +ħ²/4,

Second term |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 up, 2 down, so expectation -ħ²/4,

Third term |↓↑↑⟩: particles 1 down, 2 up, so S1·S2 between them is -ħ²/4,

So summing up:

(1/√3)^2 * ( +1/4 -1/4 -1/4 ) = (1/3)*(-1/4) = -1/12. That's correct.

Similarly for S1·S3:

First term |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 3 are up and down → -1/4,

Second term |↑↓↑⟩: 1 and 3 both up → +1/4,

Third term |↓↑↑⟩: 1 down, 3 up → -1/4,

So again, ( -1/4 +1/4 -1/4 ) /3 = -1/12,

Same with S2·S3:

First term |↑↑↓⟩ → up and down: -1/4,

Second term |↑↓↑⟩ → down and up: -1/4,

Third term |↓↑↑⟩ → up and up: +1/4,

So again, same result.

Thus total expectation value H = A*( -1/12 -1/12 -1/12 ) = -1/4 A ħ². But this contradicts the supposed answer of 2/3 A ħ². So clearly, there's a problem here.

Hmm. Maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that in the scalar product S·S, the operators are in terms of ħ, but perhaps I missed a factor of ħ somewhere? Wait, the formula I used was for dimensionless spins, but actually the spin operators have units. Wait, let me recall:

The spin operators for spin 1/2 are in units of ħ. The z-component S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The spin matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the scalar product S_i · S_j has units of (ħ)^2. The expectation value I computed would then be (ħ)^2 times (1/4 or -1/4). But in my calculation above, I assumed that the eigenvalues of S_i · S_j are (ħ)^2 /4 etc. So that part is correct. The result -A*(ħ)^2 /4 is in units of ħ². But the given answer is 2/3 Aħ². So this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the definition of the scalar product. Maybe in the problem statement, the scalar product is defined without the ħ² factor? Like sometimes in the literature, people write S·S where each S is in units of ħ. So then, the scalar product would have eigenvalues 0.25 or -0.75, but then multiplied by A, so the eigenvalue would be A*(0.25 or -0.75). If that's the case, then the units would be different. Wait, but the problem says eigenvalue 2/3 A hbar². So the answer must include hbar squared. Therefore maybe my calculation is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value. Let's try a different approach.

Another way to approach this is to note that the given state is symmetric under permutations of the three particles. Since the Hamiltonian is also symmetric (each pair is treated equally), perhaps the state is an eigenstate of H. To check that, let's see if H psi is proportional to psi.

Let me try to compute H psi.

First, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let's compute each term's action on psi.

First, let me denote the three terms in psi as follows:

psi1 = |↑↑↓⟩,

psi2 = |↑↓↑⟩,

psi3 = |↓↑↑⟩,

so psi = 1/√3 (psi1 + psi2 + psi3).

We need to compute H psi = A*( (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) (psi1 + psi2 + psi3) )

Compute each term:

First, compute S1·S2 acting on each psi_i:

S1·S2 psi1: acting on |↑↑↓⟩, as we saw earlier, S1·S2 here has eigenvalue +ħ²/4, so this would be (ħ²/4) psi1.

Wait, but actually, S1·S2 is an operator, so the eigenvalue is (S1·S2) |psi1> = (3/4)( (S1^2 + S2^2)/2 - (S1 + S2)^2 / 2 ) but maybe better to think in terms of the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps when acting on a state like |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 would just multiply it by the eigenvalue? Wait, is the state |↑↑↓⟩ an eigenstate of S1·S2?

Yes, because S1·S2 acts only on the first two particles. The state |↑↑↓⟩ is an eigenstate of S1·S2 with eigenvalue ħ²/4. Because the first two particles are in a triplet state, so their S1·S2 has eigenvalue ħ²/4.

Similarly:

S1·S2 psi2 = S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩. Here, the first two particles are in |↑↓⟩, which is not an eigenstate of the total spin, but their S1·S2 would act as follows. Wait, but as an operator, acting on |↑↓⟩:

The operator S1·S2 on |↑↓⟩ would give:

(S1·S2)|↑↓⟩ = ( (S1_z S2_z + S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y) ) |↑↓⟩

We can compute this:

S1_z S2_z |↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) ) |↑↓⟩,

S1_x S2_x |↑↓⟩ = ( (S1_x |↑⟩ ) (S2_x |↓⟩ ) )

Wait, better to write in terms of matrix elements. Alternatively, let's note that in the basis of the first two particles, the state |↑↓⟩ is a combination of triplet and singlet. So perhaps S1·S2 acting on |↑↓⟩ would produce a combination?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ as:

The operator S1·S2 in the first two spins can be written as (S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2)/2. Wait, no, actually earlier formula was S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. Wait, let's get that right.

The identity is (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. So rearranged, S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2. 

Therefore, acting on |↑↓⟩:

Because S1^2 |↑⟩ = (3ħ²/4)|↑⟩, similarly S2^2 |↓⟩ = 3ħ²/4 |↓⟩. 

(S1 + S2)^2 is the total spin squared of the first two particles. The state |↑↓⟩ is part of the total spin 0 and 1. Let me write |↑↓⟩ as a combination:

The total spin 0 (singlet) is ( |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2),

The total spin 1 states are:

|1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

|1,0⟩ = ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2),

|1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩,

Therefore, |↑↓⟩ can be expressed as ( |1,0⟩ + singlet )?

Specifically,

|↑↓⟩ = ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2? Hmm, perhaps better:

Wait, to decompose |↑↓⟩ into total spin states:

Let me denote the total spin operator as S = S1 + S2. Then,

|↑↓⟩ = ( |↑1↓2⟩ )

Expressed in the total spin basis:

It's 1/√2 (|1,0⟩ + |0⟩ )

Wait, where |1,0⟩ is the triplet state (↑↓ + ↓↑)/sqrt(2), and |0⟩ is the singlet (↑↓ - ↓↑)/sqrt(2). Therefore,

|↑↓⟩ = 1/√2 ( |1,0⟩ + |0⟩ ) 

Therefore,

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = S^2 |↑↓⟩ = [ (1(1+1)ħ²) |1,0⟩ + (0(0+1)ħ²)|0⟩ ] * (1/√2)

So,

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ħ² ( |1,0⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + 0

Then,

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = [ (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ - S1^2 |↑↓⟩ - S2^2 |↑↓⟩ ] / 2

= [ ( ħ² |1,0> / sqrt(2) ) - (3ħ²/4 |↑>⊗|↓⟩ ) - (3ħ²/4 |↑⟩⊗|↓⟩ ) ] /2 

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, compute the expectation value as before:

Alternatively, since <S1·S2> in the state |↑↓⟩ is -ħ²/4, then as an operator, S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ would give an operator acting on the state, but perhaps the result is a combination which, when projected back into the original basis, may not just be a scalar multiple, so the expectation value is -ħ²/4 but the state itself is not an eigenstate. Therefore, when acting on psi, which is a combination of these terms, the operator S1·S2 will mix the terms.

This complicates things. Maybe instead of trying to compute H psi directly, we need to use the fact that the given state is a symmetric combination and perhaps lies in a particular total spin subspace.

Alternatively, let's think about the total spin of the three particles. The given state has two up spins and one down. The total spin can range from 3/2 (all aligned) down to 1/2 (if two up and one down are arranged to cancel). But since it's symmetric, perhaps the total spin is 1/2 or something else?

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2 or other? Wait, the total spin S_total for three spin-1/2 particles can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me check:

The possible total spin values when adding three spin-1/2 particles:

Start with first two particles: their total spin can be 0 or 1. Adding the third spin-1/2:

- If first two total spin 0, adding third spin 1/2 gives total spin 1/2.

- If first two total spin 1, adding third spin 1/2 gives total spins 3/2 or 1/2.

Therefore, the total spin for three spin-1/2 particles can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state given has two up and one down, so it's in the spin-1/2 or spin-3/2 subspace?

Wait, the symmetric combination given:

psi=1/√3 (↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑)

This is the symmetric combination of two up and one down. This is actually the totally symmetric state of three spin-1/2 particles. Because if you have three spins, the fully symmetric state under permutation would be this one (since permuting the particles cycles the positions of the down spin but keeps the overall structure the same).

For three spin-1/2 particles, the totally symmetric state has total spin 3/2. Because the symmetric combination is the highest possible spin. Wait, but when you have three spin-1/2 particles, the maximum total spin is 3/2, so the symmetric state is the 3/2 state. However, the given state is symmetric, so it must be in the 3/2 subspace? 

Wait, let me verify:

The fully symmetric state for three spin-1/2 particles is indeed the |3/2, 3/2⟩ state, which is ↑↑↑. The next one is |3/2, 1/2⟩ which is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, which is exactly what we have here. Wait, actually:

The state psi is 1/√3 (↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑), which is the same as the state |3/2, 1/2⟩ for the total spin. Because in the total spin 3/2, the states are:

|3/2, 3/2⟩ = ↑↑↑,

|3/2, 1/2⟩ = (↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑)/√3,

[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles and their Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The spin state is given as ψ = 1/√3*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what's the energy. If not, then find the expectation value of E. The answer is supposed to be it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3 A ℏ², but I need to work through it.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators Si·Sj can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The dot product S·S between two spins can be expressed as (S1·S2 + S2·S1)/2 plus some constants, but maybe I need to think in terms of total spin operators?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the expectation value of H in the given state. Since H is a sum of three terms, the expectation value will be the sum of each term's expectation value.

The given state ψ is symmetric under permutations of the particles. Let me see: each term in ψ has exactly two up spins and one down spin. So if I swap particles 1 and 2, for instance, the first term (up1 up2 down3) stays the same, and the other terms swap as well? Hmm, actually, the terms are:

1. up1 up2 down3,

2. up1 down2 up3,

3. down1 up2 up3.

If I swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2 up1 down3 which is the same as the original first term, since tensor products are ordered, but actually, the numbering changes. Wait, no, the first term after swapping 1 and 2 would be up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the original second term? Wait, no, the second term is up1 down2 up3. Hmm, maybe permutation symmetry isn't straightforward here. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe since each of the three terms in ψ have two up spins and one down spin, but each term is cyclic permutations. So ψ is symmetric under cyclic permutations of the three particles. However, for the purposes of the Hamiltonian, since the terms in H are symmetric over the pairs (1-2, 1-3, 2-3), maybe the state ψ is an eigenstate because it's symmetric in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps it's in a specific total spin state. Let me try to recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2 (either all aligned or some combination). The state given here might have some specific total angular momentum quantum number.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute H acting on ψ directly. Let me see.

First, note that the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ and see if it's equal to a scalar multiple of ψ.

Alternatively, if Hψ = Eψ, then it's an eigenstate. Let me try to compute Hψ.

First, let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i² + S_j²)/2. Since each S_i² = (3/4)ħ² for a spin-1/2 particle, so:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_total_ij)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, the Hamiltonian can be written as:

H = A [ (1/2)(S_total_12)^2 - 3ħ²/4 + (1/2)(S_total_13)^2 - 3ħ²/4 + (1/2)(S_total_23)^2 - 3ħ²/4 ]

Simplifying:

H = (A/2)[ (S_total_12)^2 + (S_total_13)^2 + (S_total_23)^2 ] - 9Aħ²/8

Hmm, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute Hψ directly term by term.

First, let me write down the Hamiltonian explicitly. Since each S·S term is the sum of the products of the components: S1·S2 = S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z. But maybe instead of dealing with components, since the given state has definite S_z values?

Alternatively, since the state is a combination of states with different z-components, but each term has exactly one down spin. Wait, actually each term in ψ has two up and one down. Wait, the first term is up1 up2 down3, so total S_z is (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 1/2. Similarly, all terms have S_z = 1/2. So the total S_z of the state is 1/2. But total spin S could be 3/2 or 1/2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a singlet or triplet? Wait, with three particles, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or maybe other configurations?

Alternatively, maybe we can think of the state as a symmetric combination. Let me see the given state is:

ψ = 1/√3 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

This is a symmetric state under permutation of the three particles. That is, swapping any two particles will permute the terms cyclically. Therefore, this state is symmetric under the exchange of particles, suggesting it might belong to a particular multiplet.

Alternatively, maybe this is the symmetric state with total spin S = 1/2? For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin is 3/2 and 1/2. The symmetric states would correspond to certain multiplicities.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator? Let me recall that the total spin squared operator is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Let's compute that.

But maybe first, to check if ψ is an eigenstate of H. Let me see if Hψ can be written as a scalar multiple of ψ.

Let me try to compute H acting on each term of ψ. Let me denote each term as follows:

Let term1 = |↑⟩1 ⊗ |↑⟩2 ⊗ |↓⟩3,

term2 = |↑⟩1 ⊗ |↓⟩2 ⊗ |↑⟩3,

term3 = |↓⟩1 ⊗ |↑⟩2 ⊗ |↑⟩3.

So ψ = 1/√3 (term1 + term2 + term3).

Now, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So let's compute H term1, H term2, H term3, then take the linear combination.

First, compute S1·S2 term1:

S1·S2 acts on term1. Since term1 has particles 1 and 2 both up. The S·S operator between particles 1 and 2 when both are up will have a value of (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ²? Wait, no, more precisely, for two spins, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²). For particles 1 and 2 both spin-up, the total spin squared is (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = [ (S_total)^2 - S1² - S2² ] / 2.

But when both spins are up, the total spin of 1 and 2 is 1 (since they are both up, spin-up + spin-up gives a triplet state with S=1). So S_total² = (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². Then S1·S2 = [2ħ² - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ² ] /2 = [2ħ² - (3/2)ħ²]/2 = ( (4/2 - 3/2) )ħ² /2 = (1/2 ħ²)/2 = (1/4)ħ².

Alternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way. For two spin-1/2 particles in the state |↑↑⟩, the S·S operator value can be calculated using the matrix elements.

Alternatively, for two spins, the operator S_i·S_j in the basis of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩ has specific matrix elements. Let's recall that in the |↑↑⟩ state, the value of S₁·S₂ is (S₁z S₂z + (1/2)(S₁+ S₂- + S₁- S₂+ )). Since S₁z = (ħ/2), S₂z = (ħ/2), so S₁z S₂z = (ħ/2)^2.

The cross terms: S₁+ |↑↑⟩ = 0, since S₁+ on the first spin up gives zero. Similarly, S₂+ acting on the second spin up also gives zero. Therefore the cross terms vanish. Therefore, S₁·S₂ acting on |↑↑⟩ is just (ħ/2)^2.

Wait but the cross terms might not vanish. Let me compute S1·S2 operator.

Actually, S₁·S₂ operator is (S_{1x} S_{2x} + S_{1y} S_{2y} + S_{1z} S_{2z}).

Since the first term is |↑⟩1 |↑⟩2,

the S_x terms: S_{1x} |↑⟩1 = (ħ/2)|↓⟩1,

and S_{2x} |↑⟩2 = (ħ/2)|↓⟩2,

so S_{1x} S_{2x} acting on |↑↑⟩ would be (ħ²/4)|↓↓⟩,

Similarly, S_{1y} and S_{2y} would contribute similarly, but with imaginary terms, but when taking the product, maybe the cross terms will combine.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value in the |↑↑⟩ state.

Alternatively, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles:

⟨↑↑ | S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = (S₁z S₂z + (S₁+ S₂- + S₁- S₂+ )/2 )⟨↑↑ | ... |↑↑⟩.

As before, the S₁+ and S₂+ terms when acting on |↑↑⟩ will produce |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩, but since the state is |↑↑⟩, when multiplied by S₁- and S₂- terms, perhaps it cancels?

Wait, let me do this step by step:

First, S₁·S₂ = (S₁z S₂z) + (S₁x S₂x + S₁y S₂y).

But S₁x S₂x + S₁y S₂y = ( (S₁x)^2 + (S₁y)^2 ) /2 * (similar for spin 2) ??? Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity:

S₁·S₂ = 1/2 (S₁ + S₂)^2 - 1/2 (S₁² + S₂²)

Which would be:

⟨↑↑ | S₁·S₂ |↑↑⟩ = 1/2 ⟨↑↑| (S₁ + S₂)^2 |↑↑⟩ - 1/2 (⟨S₁²⟩ + ⟨S₂²⟩ )

Since each spin is 1/2, S₁² = (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = 3/4 ħ², so same for S₂². So the second term is 1/2 (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² ) = 3/4 ħ².

Now, (S₁ + S₂)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + 2 S₁·S₂. Therefore,

⟨↑↑ | (S₁ + S₂)^2 |↑↑⟩ = ⟨S₁²⟩ + ⟨S₂²⟩ + 2 ⟨S₁·S₂⟩.

Hmm, but this seems circular. Wait, but in the |↑↑⟩ state, the total spin is S=1, so (S_total)^2 = (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2 ħ². Therefore,

⟨↑↑ | (S₁ + S₂)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ².

Therefore, substituting back:

⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = 1/2 * 2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² = ħ² - 3/4 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

So that's the same as before. So for the term1, which is |↑↑↓⟩, the S1·S2 term will contribute 1/4 ħ².

Then S1·S3 acting on term1. Let's compute S1·S3 for particles 1 and 3 in the state |↑↓⟩. Wait, in term1, particle 3 is down, so the state between particles 1 and 3 is |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩.

So S1·S3 between particles 1 and 3 in state |↑↓⟩. Let's compute that.

Again using the identity:

⟨↑↓ | S₁·S₃ |↑↓⟩ = 1/2 (⟨(S1 + S3)^2⟩ - ⟨S1²⟩ - ⟨S3²⟩).

The total spin of |↑↓⟩: the state is a singlet? Wait, no, |↑↓⟩ is not a singlet. Let me see:

The state |↑↓⟩ can be written as a combination of S=1 and S=0 states. Let me compute (S₁ + S₃)^2 on |↑↓⟩:

First, the total spin squared:

S_total² = (S1 + S3)^2 = S1² + S3² + 2 S1·S3.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨S1²⟩ + ⟨S3²⟩ + 2 ⟨S1·S3⟩.

But ⟨S_total²⟩ can be computed by noting that |↑↓⟩ is part of the total spin basis.

The state |↑↓⟩ can be expressed as (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2 for S=0 and (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 for S=1. But here we have just |↑↓⟩, which is a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute the expectation value.

Compute ⟨↑↓ | S₁·S₃ |↑↓⟩ using components:

S_z terms: S₁z is +ħ/2 for the first particle, S₃z is -ħ/2 for the third, so their product is - (ħ/2)^2.

The cross terms: S₁x S₃x + S₁y S₃y.

Similarly to earlier, let's compute each component:

S₁x |↑⟩1 = (ħ/2)|↓⟩1,

S₃x |↓⟩3 = (ħ/2)|↑⟩3,

Therefore S₁x S₃x |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩,

Similarly, S₁y |↑⟩1 = (iħ/2)|↓⟩1,

S₃y |↓⟩3 = (-iħ/2)|↑⟩3,

Thus S₁y S₃y |↑↓⟩ = (iħ/2)(-iħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = (-i^2 ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

Adding S₁x S₃x and S₁y S₃y gives:

( (1/4) + (1/4) ) ħ² |↓↑⟩ ?

Wait, actually, the cross terms contribute S₁x S₃x + S₁y S₃y. When acting on |↑↓⟩,

the result is (ħ/2)^2 ( |↓↑⟩ for x terms, and (i)(-i) gives +1 for y terms, so the total is (S₁x S₃x + S₁y S₃y)|↑↓⟩ = ( (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) ) |↓↑⟩. Wait, but actually:

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

The operator S₁x S₃x acting on |↑↓⟩ is (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩,

Similarly, S₁y S₃y acting on |↑↓⟩ is (iħ/2)(-iħ/2)|↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

so together, the sum is (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/2)|↓↑⟩,

But the expectation value ⟨↑↓ | S₁x S₃x + S₁y S₃y |↑↓⟩ is the inner product of ⟨↑↓| with that result. But ⟨↑↓| acting on |↓↑⟩ gives zero, since they are orthogonal. So the cross terms actually contribute zero to the expectation value?

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again:

The expectation value is ⟨↑↓| (S₁·S₃) |↑↓⟩. Since S₁·S₃ = S₁z S₃z + (S₁x S₃x + S₁y S₃y).

When we act with the cross terms on |↑↓⟩, we get terms proportional to |↓↑⟩, but when taking the inner product with ⟨↑↓|, which is orthogonal to |↓↑⟩, those terms vanish.

Therefore, only the S_z term survives. So,

⟨↑↓| S₁·S₃ |↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓| S₁z S₃z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = - (ħ/2)^2.

Therefore, S₁·S₃ acting on |↑↓⟩ gives the expectation value of - (ħ²)/4.

Therefore, in term1, which is the state |↑↑↓⟩, the S1·S3 contribution is -1/4 ħ².

Similarly, the next term in the Hamiltonian is S2·S3 acting on term1. Let's see, in term1, the second and third particles are |↑⟩2 and |↓⟩3. So their state is |↑↓⟩ between particles 2 and 3. The calculation for S2·S3 is the same as S1·S3 above, so also -1/4 ħ².

Therefore, altogether, for term1 = |↑↑↓⟩,

H acting on it would be A*( [S1·S2 term1] + [S1·S3 term1] + [S2·S3 term1] )

= A*( (1/4 ħ²) + (-1/4 ħ²) + (-1/4 ħ²) )

= A*( -1/4 ħ² )

Hmm, so H term1 = - (Aħ²)/4 * term1.

Wait but need to confirm again:

Wait, S1·S2 for particles 1 and 2 in |↑↑⟩ gives +1/4 ħ²,

S1·S3 for 1 and 3 in |↑↓⟩ gives -1/4 ħ²,

S2·S3 for 2 and 3 in |↑↓⟩ gives -1/4 ħ²,

Adding those: 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4 ħ²,

So indeed, H term1 = - (Aħ²)/4 term1.

Similarly, let me compute H term2 and H term3.

Take term2 = |↑↓↑⟩. Let's compute each term in H:

First S1·S2: particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↓⟩. So similar to previous calculation, the expectation of S1·S2 here is computed as follows:

⟨↑↓ | S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = ?

Again, using the same method as before, since |↑↓⟩ is for two particles:

The total spin squared for particles 1 and 2 is (S1 + S2)^2. Since |↑↓⟩ can be part of a singlet or triplet, but the expectation value would be similar.

Alternatively, we can compute:

⟨↑↓ | S₁·S₂ |↑↓⟩ = (S₁z S₂z + (S₁x S₂x + S₁y S₂y) )⟨↑↓ | ... |↑↓⟩.

The S_z terms: S₁z = +ħ/2, S₂z = -ħ/2. So their product is - (ħ/2)^2.

The cross terms: S₁x S₂x |↑↓⟩ is (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩,

Similarly S₁y S₂y |↑↓⟩ is (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩,

So the cross terms acting on |↑↓⟩ give (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² |↓↑⟩, but when taking the expectation value with ⟨↑↓|, which is orthogonal, so those cross terms contribute zero.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓|S₁·S₂|↑↓⟩ = - (ħ/2)^2 = -1/4 ħ².

Then, S1·S3 in term2 is between particles 1 and 3: particles 1 and 3 are both up. Wait, term2 is |↑⟩1 |↓⟩2 |↑⟩3. So between 1 and 3, it's |↑↑⟩.

So S₁·S3 (particles 1 and 3) here is the same as earlier when they were both up: +1/4 ħ².

Then S2·S3: particles 2 and 3 are |↓↑⟩, which is similar to |↑↓⟩ but swapped. The calculation is the same: ⟨↓↑ | S2·S3 |↓↑⟩ = same as before, -1/4 ħ². Because S_z terms: -ħ/2 * ħ/2 = - (ħ/2)^2,

and cross terms again vanish in expectation value.

Therefore, S2·S3 contribution is -1/4 ħ².

Therefore, for term2:

H term2 = A*( (-1/4 ħ²) + (1/4 ħ²) + (-1/4 ħ²) ) = A*( -1/4 ħ² )

Similarly, term3 is |↓↑↑⟩. Let's compute the same:

S1·S2: particles1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩, so similar to |↑↓⟩, the S1·S2 term is -1/4 ħ²,

S1·S3: particles 1 and3: particles 1 is down, 3 up → state is |↓↑⟩, so S1·S3 = -1/4 ħ²,

S2·S3: particles 2 and 3 are both up: |↑↑⟩, so S2·S3 = +1/4 ħ²,

Thus summing them: (-1/4) + (-1/4) + (1/4) = -1/4 ħ²,

Hence H term3 = A*(-1/4 ħ²) term3.

Therefore, putting all together, Hψ is:

Hψ = A/4 * [ - term1 - term2 - term3 ]

But wait, each term is multiplied by -Aħ²/4,

Wait more precisely,

Hψ = A*(-ħ²/4) [ term1 + term2 + term3 ] = - (Aħ²)/4 * ψ,

since ψ = 1/√3 (term1 + term2 + term3). Wait, but Hψ would be - (Aħ² /4 ) times the vector (term1 + term2 + term3), but the given ψ is 1/√3 times that. So actually,

Hψ = - (Aħ² /4 ) * √3 ψ.

Wait, no, let me write it step by step:

ψ = 1/√3 (term1 + term2 + term3),

then Hψ = 1/√3 [ H term1 + H term2 + H term3 ]

But H term1 = - (Aħ²/4) term1,

Similarly for term2 and term3,

Therefore,

Hψ = 1/√3 [ - (Aħ²/4)(term1 + term2 + term3) ] = - (Aħ²/4) * (term1 + term2 + term3)/√3,

But (term1 + term2 + term3)/√3 is exactly ψ. Therefore,

Hψ = - (Aħ²/4) ψ,

Wait but that would mean that ψ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue -Aħ²/4.

But the problem states the answer is 2/3 Aħ². So I must have messed up the calculations.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me check the calculation again step by step.

Starting with S1·S2 on term1 (|↑↑↓⟩):

As before, S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩ gives +1/4 ħ²,

S1·S3 on |↑↓⟩ gives -1/4 ħ²,

S2·S3 on |↑↓⟩ gives -1/4 ħ²,

Total: 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4. So that's correct.

Same for the other terms.

Thus, each term in Hψ gets multiplied by -Aħ²/4, so Hψ = (-Aħ²/4)ψ,

which would mean eigenvalue -Aħ²/4,

But this contradicts the given answer of 2/3 Aħ². So clearly, I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation of S1·S2 when both spins are up again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign?

Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1² - S2²). Since S_total^2 for two spins in triplet (S=1) is (1)(2)ħ² = 2ħ²,

so (1/2)(2ħ² - 3/4ħ² - 3/4ħ² ) = (1/2)(2ħ² - 3/2ħ²) = (1/2)( (4/2 - 3/2 )ħ² ) = (1/2)(1/2 ħ²) = 1/4 ħ²,

so that's correct.

Hmm, but then the result suggests eigenvalue -Aħ²/4. But the question says the answer is 2/3 Aħ². Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the signs? Let me check S_z components again.

Wait, when calculating S1·S3 for term1 (particles 1 and 3 in |↑↓⟩):

⟨↑↓ | S1·S3 |↑↓⟩,

the S_z terms are (↑,↓): (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = - (ħ/2)^2,

so that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the cross terms actually contribute?

Wait, in the calculation above, for S1·S2 in |↑↓⟩, the cross terms (x and y components) when acting on |↑↓⟩ would result in |↓↑⟩, and the expectation value is zero because ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ =0.

But maybe when acting on the full state, there's more?

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that H acts only on individual terms, but since H is a sum of pairwise interactions, each term in H will act on the entire state. Wait, no, actually, when H is written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), it's a sum of three terms. Each term is an operator acting on the entire state. So when I compute Hψ, it's indeed equivalent to computing each term separately and summing.

But in my calculation above, I considered each term1, term2, term3 individually, but actually, each term in H (like S1·S2, etc.) acts on the entire state ψ, not just each term of ψ individually. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because ψ is a linear combination of the terms, so Hψ is the same as H applied to each term and then added.

Wait, the problem is in the calculation of H term1. Let me make sure.

Wait, term1 is |↑↑↓⟩. So when you act S1·S2 on term1, you get the expectation value contribution, but actually, in operator form, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ would give a scalar multiple of the state? Or create other states?

Wait, actually S1·S2 is an operator, so acting on |↑↑↓⟩, it might not leave the state as a multiple of term1, but might mix with other terms. Wait, that's a key mistake I made earlier. I assumed that S1·S2 acting on term1 would leave it in the same term, but that's not necessarily true.

Oh no! I think this is the problem. I treated Hψ as if each term of ψ is an eigenstate of each S_i·S_j term, which is not the case. The operators S_i·S_j can mix different terms. For example, acting with S1·S2 on |↑↑↓⟩ might produce terms with different spin orientations.

Therefore, my previous calculation is incorrect because it assumed that S_i·S_j acting on a term would stay within that term, but actually it can mix into other terms. Therefore, I need to redo the calculation properly, considering that each S·S operator can act nontrivially and produce different states.

This complicates things. Hmm. So perhaps a better approach is to note that the given state is symmetric. Let me consider the total spin of the system.

Since all three particles are spin-1/2, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The given state is symmetric under exchange of particles.

The symmetric states for three spin-1/2 particles:

The total spin 3/2 has a symmetric state (the four-fold multiplet), and the total spin 1/2 also has a symmetric state (the two-fold multiplet). Wait, actually, the symmetric combination for three spin-1/2 particles would result in total spin 3/2 (symmetric) and 1/2 (antisymmetric?), but maybe not exactly.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, the total spin for three spin-1/2 particles:

The possible total spins are 3/2, 1/2, and maybe 3/2 and 1/2 again? Let me recall the decomposition:

The combination of three spin-1/2 particles:

Start by combining the first two, which can give spin 1 or 0. Then combine the third with those.

Combining spin 1 with spin 1/2: gives 3/2 or 1/2,

Combining spin 0 with spin1/2 gives 1/2.

Therefore total spins possible are 3/2 (from spin1 + spin1/2), and 1/2 (from spin0 + spin1/2 and spin1 + spin1/2). So total spins are 3/2 (multiplicity 4?), and 1/2 (multiplicity 2 + 2 = 4? Wait perhaps different multiplicities.

Alternatively, the total dimension is 2^3 =8, and the total spins are 3/2 (dimension 4) and 1/2 (dimension 4). Wait, actually, spin 3/2 has 4 states, spin 1/2 has 4 states? That adds up to 8. Hmm, possible.

The symmetric states would belong to certain of these.

The given state is symmetric under all permutations, so it must be in the symmetric irreducible representation. The symmetric combination for three spin-1/2 particles corresponds to the total spin 3/2 and some parts of the 1/2 spin states?

Wait, actually the symmetric combination would correspond to the total spin 3/2 state. Because the symmetric triplet (S=1) for two spins combined with a third spin gives a symmetric total spin 3/2 state. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the fully symmetric state is the |↑↑↑⟩ state for S=3/2, M=3/2. But the given state has one down spin, so M=1/2, so it can't be the highest weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is part of the S=1/2 representation?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of the total spin operators?

Alternatively, let me compute the total spin squared S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

If the given ψ is an eigenstate of S², then it has a definite total spin.

Compute S² ψ.

Since S² commutes with the Hamiltonian H (if H is written in terms of pairs, but in this case H is S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which also commutes with S².

Therefore, if H and S² commute, their eigenstates can be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates. So maybe the given state is an eigenstate of both.

Alternatively, let me try to compute S² acting on ψ.

First, S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2.

Given that each S_i² = 3/4 ħ²,

Thus,

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - 3*(3/4 ħ²)) /2 )

= (A/2)(S² - 9/4 ħ²)

Therefore, H = (A/2) S² - (9A/8) ħ².

Therefore, if I can find S² acting on ψ, then I can find Hψ.

Therefore, perhaps it's easier to compute S² ψ.

Let me compute ⟨ψ | S² | ψ ⟩.

Alternatively, maybe compute S² ψ directly.

But since ψ is symmetric, and if it's an eigenstate of S², then Hψ would be proportional to ψ.

Let me see, to compute S² ψ:

Let me note that ψ is 1/√3 (term1 + term2 + term3). Let me compute S² on each term, then combine.

First, term1 = |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S² term1:

First, S1 + S2 + S3 acting on term1:

The z-component is (1/2 +1/2 -1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ,

so S_z = 1/2 ħ,

then S² term1 = |S(S+1)|² ħ²,

but need to know what S is here.

Alternatively, compute S² explicitly.

Alternatively, note that S² can be written in terms of the individual spins and their dot products:

S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, S² term1 = (3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 +
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem here about three spin 1/2 particles and their Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state vector provided is ψ = 1/√3*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what's the energy? If not, find the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*ħ². Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to recall some spin operator properties. Each spin operator Si·Sj is the dot product of the spin vectors for particles i and j. For spin 1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be written as (S_i_x S_j_x + S_i_y S_j_y + S_i_z S_j_z). Alternatively, there's a formula that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i+j}² - S_i² - S_j²). Wait, actually, the identity is S·S' = (S_total)^2 - S² - S'² all over 2. Maybe that can be helpful here?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly. Since the state is given, maybe we can compute ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ and see if it's proportional to ψ, which would mean it's an eigenstate. Alternatively, check if the state is invariant under H up to a scalar factor. Hmm.

First, let me note that the state ψ is symmetric in some way. Looking at the three terms:

1. up1 up2 down3
2. up1 down2 up3
3. down1 up2 up3

Each term has two up spins and one down spin, but the down spin is on a different particle each time. So the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles? Wait, actually, let's see. If I swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the original first term (since spin-up is the same if particles are swapped?), but actually, spin states are tensor products, so swapping particles 1 and 2 would swap the first and second components. However, the original terms are ordered as up1, up2, down3. So swapping 1 and 2 would give up2 up1 down3, which is not exactly the same as the first term unless we consider that the order doesn't matter? Wait, no, since each position in the tensor product corresponds to a specific particle. So the term up1 up2 down3 is different from up2 up1 down3 unless the spins are symmetric. Since the given state has all three terms with different positions for the down spin, it is symmetric in a cyclic permutation? Maybe it's symmetric under cyclic permutations? Not sure, but perhaps the key is that the state is fully symmetric under exchange of the particles?

Wait, actually, let me see the coefficients. The state is (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), where each term is a different permutation of having two up spins and one down. So this is a symmetric combination, so ψ is symmetric under exchange of particles. Since the Hamiltonian also treats particles symmetrically (since it's the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is symmetric in all three particles, maybe the state is an eigenstate?

Alternatively, maybe we can figure out the total spin of the state. For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric combination here might correspond to a particular total spin state.

But perhaps the easiest way is to compute the expectation value ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩). Since the state is symmetric, all three terms should have the same expectation value, so we can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ and multiply by 3.

Therefore, first compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ in the given state.

Let me first recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 between two states can be computed if I know their spin.

Alternatively, maybe we can express S1·S2 in terms of the total spin operators? Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2). Hmm, so maybe that's useful here. Let me think.

Alternatively, since each term in H is S_i·S_j, so H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let me compute H acting on ψ and see if it's proportional to ψ.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, maybe it's an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian? Let me try to see.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is the symmetric state with one down spin and two up spins, and the Hamiltonian is symmetric, so maybe H commutes with the permutation symmetries, so that symmetric states are eigenstates?

Alternatively, let me proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the expectation value of S1·S2. Since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩, so we can just compute one of them and multiply by 3.

To compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, we can write the state ψ as (1/√3)(|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩). Let's first consider the first term, |↑↑↓⟩. Let me compute S1·S2 acting on this term.

First, S1 and S2 are the spin operators for the first and second particles. So when acting on |↑↑↓⟩, let's see:

S1 is for particle 1, S2 for particle 2. Let me recall that for spin operators, S_i^2 = (ħ²/4)(1), so S1^2 acting on any single particle state gives ħ²/4. Wait, but here S1 and S2 are vector operators, so S1·S2 is the sum over components. Maybe it's easier to compute each component.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1² + S2²). Since S1 and S2 are spin 1/2 operators, their squares are (3ħ²/4) for each, so S1² = S2² = 3ħ²/4.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4) ) = (1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - 3ħ²/2 )

Hmm, so maybe better to compute (S1 + S2)^2 first?

Alternatively, let me consider that for two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be written as (⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩)/2. Since in this case, for the two spins 1 and 2, their total spin squared operator is (S1 + S2)^2. So maybe compute the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 and then subtract the individual terms.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value directly by matrix elements. Since we have the state, let's compute the expectation of S1·S2 on each term and then combine them.

Let me first consider the basis: each spin can be either up or down. Since we're dealing with three particles, but when considering S1·S2, perhaps we can treat the third particle as a spectator for that term.

Wait, actually, the operator S1·S2 acts only on the first and second particles, so when computing ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩, each term in the expansion can be evaluated by looking at the first two spins. Let me consider the first term in ψ: |↑↑↓⟩. Let me compute S1·S2 acting on this term.

First, S1·S2 on |↑↑↓⟩. Since the third particle is down, but the operator doesn't act on it. The first two particles are both up. Let me recall that S1·S2 on |↑↑⟩ for two spins is:

The eigenvalues of S_total^2 for two spins: |↑↑⟩ has total spin 1, so S_total^2 = ( (1)(1+1) )ħ² = 2ħ². Then since S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1² - S2²)/2, so substituting:

= (2ħ² - (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4)) / 2

Wait, S1² is (ħ/2)^2 times (1/2)^2 * 3? Wait no. Wait S1 for each particle is spin 1/2, so the square operator gives (ħ²/4)( (1/2)(1/2 +1) )? Wait no, actually, the spin operators for a single particle have eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ² where S=1/2. So S1² acting on a single particle gives (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So for two particles, S1² and S2² each contribute 3ħ²/4. So:

S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 = (S_total^2 - 3ħ²/2)/2.

Therefore, for state |↑↑⟩, which is a triplet state (total spin 1), S_total^2 = (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2 ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩ ?

Wait no, actually that would be the expectation value. Wait, actually, the operator S1·S2 is (S_total^2 - (S1² + S2²))/2. So acting on the state |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet with S=1, then S_total^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2ħ² |↑↑⟩. Therefore,

S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = [ (S_total^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩

= [ (2ħ² - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4)/2 ] |↑↑⟩

= [ (2ħ² - 3ħ²/2 ) / 2 ] |↑↑⟩

Compute the numerator: 2ħ² - 3ħ²/2 = (4ħ² - 3ħ²)/2 = (ħ²)/2. Therefore, divided by 2 gives (ħ²/2)/2 = ħ²/4.

Therefore S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4) |↑↑⟩.

Similarly, when acting on |↑↑⟩, the S1·S2 operator gives ħ²/4. Wait, but let me check another way.

Alternatively, the expectation value of S1·S2 for two up spins is ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩. Let me compute that using the components.

The spin-up state for each particle is eigenvector of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The S_x and S_y components would involve raising and lowering operators.

Alternatively, perhaps easier to recall that for two spin 1/2 particles in the singlet or triplet states. For the triplet, which includes |↑↑⟩, the S1·S2 expectation value is ( (S(S+1) - S1² - S2²)/2 )ħ². So S=1, so S(S+1)=2, so (2 - 3/2)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4. So yes, that gives (1/4)ħ². So that's the expectation value for two up spins.

Now, let's go back to the first term in ψ: |↑↑↓⟩. The action of S1·S2 on this term will give (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩, because the third particle is unaffected. Similarly, when acting on |↑↓↑⟩, which is the second term in ψ, we need to compute S1·S2 acting on the first two spins (which are up and down). Let's see:

So the first two spins here are |↑↓⟩. Let me compute S1·S2 on |↑↓⟩. Let me think. The state |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet or singlet?

The triplet states are:

|↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, and |↓↓⟩.

The singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.

So |↑↓⟩ can be a combination, but let's compute the expectation value.

Again, using the formula for S1·S2:

First, compute S_total^2 for the state |↑↓⟩. Since it's in the triplet, the triplet has S=1, so S_total^2 = 2ħ². Therefore, using the same formula:

S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = [ (S_total^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2 ] |↑↓⟩

Wait, but actually, the state |↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2 unless it's combined with |↓↑⟩. Hmm, so maybe I need to compute the expectation value directly?

Alternatively, compute ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩.

Let me recall that S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z). Let's compute each component.

First, S1_z S2_z acting on |↑↓⟩ is (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

For the x and y components, since S1_x and S2_x etc. are operators that flip spins. Let me compute the expectation value of S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z in the state |↑↓⟩.

Expressed in terms of Pauli matrices:

S_i · S_j = (ħ²/4)(σ_i · σ_j), where σ are Pauli matrices.

So the Pauli dot product for |↑↓⟩:

Let me write the spin-up state as |↑⟩ = (1,0), spin-down as |↓⟩ = (0,1).

So the state |↑⟩_1 ⊗ |↓⟩_2 is a column vector (1 0 0 0)^T? Wait, actually, arranging as |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, so |↑↓⟩ is the second component, but regardless, let's compute the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use the fact that:

For two spin states |a⟩ and |b⟩, ⟨a| S1 · S2 |b⟩ = (ħ²/4)(⟨a|σ₁ · σ₂ |b⟩).

The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z=[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Therefore,

σ₁ · σ₂ = σ_x¹ σ_x² + σ_y¹ σ_y² + σ_z¹ σ_z².

So for |↑⟩_1 ⊗ |↓⟩_2:

Let me write this as |↑↓⟩. Let me compute each term:

First, σ_x¹ σ_x² acting on |↑↓⟩:

σ_x on the first particle flips its spin, and σ_x on the second particle flips its spin. So σ_x¹ |↑⟩₁ = |↓⟩₁, and σ_x² |↓⟩₂ = |↑⟩₂. Therefore, σ_x¹ σ_x² |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, σ_y¹ σ_y² |↑↓⟩: σ_y on first particle gives -i|↓⟩₁, and σ_y on second gives i|↑⟩₂, so overall: (-i)(i)|↓↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

σ_z¹ σ_z² |↑↓⟩: σ_z on first is +1, second is -1, so total is -1, times |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, summing up the terms:

σ₁ · σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = (σ_x¹ σ_x² + σ_y¹ σ_y² + σ_z¹ σ_z²)|↑↓⟩

= |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ + (-1)|↑↓⟩.

So σ₁ · σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = 2|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| (σ₁ · σ₂) |↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓| 2|↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓||↑↓⟩ = 2⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩.

But ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ is zero because they are orthogonal, and ⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩ is 1. Therefore, this gives -1.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓|σ₁·σ₂|↑↓⟩ = -1, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4.

Wait, so S1·S2 in this case has an expectation value of -ħ²/4 for the state |↑↓⟩.

Hmm, that seems different from the previous case where for |↑↑⟩ it was +ħ²/4. Interesting.

Therefore, returning to the term |↑↓↑⟩ in the state ψ, which is the second term: when we act S1·S2 on this, we have the first two spins as |↑↓⟩, so the expectation value contribution from this term would be -ħ²/4. Wait, but actually, we need to compute the full expectation value over the entire state.

Wait, let's step back. Let me write down the full computation of ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩.

First, ψ = (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ). Let's denote the three terms as |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ for simplicity.

Therefore, ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩ = (1/√3)(⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c| ) S1·S2 (1/√3)( |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ )

= (1/3)[ ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ ]

Now, let's compute each term:

First, compute ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩:

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, so the first two spins are |↑↑⟩. As we saw before, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑⟩ gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩, so ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩ = (ħ²/4).

Similarly, ⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩. Here, the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, so as above, the expectation value here is -ħ²/4. Wait, but the third spin is up, but it doesn't affect S1·S2. Wait, actually, the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, so same as before. So yes, ⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ = -ħ²/4.

Similarly, ⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩. Here, first two spins are |↓↑⟩. Let's compute that. Let me note that |↓↑⟩ is the same as swapping the first two spins in |↑↓⟩, so swapping would give the same as |↑↓⟩ but with a possible minus sign? Wait, no, in terms of spin operators, S1 and S2 are just the operators on their respective particles, so the expectation value of S1·S2 on |↓↑⟩ should be the same as on |↑↓⟩, but let me confirm.

Indeed, S1·S2 for spins |↓↑⟩ would be similar. Let's compute it:

Compute ⟨↓↑| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩.

Again, using the Pauli matrices, similar to the previous case, but now the state is |↓↑⟩.

σ₁ · σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = ?

Let's go through:

σ_x¹ σ_x² |↓↑⟩: σ_x on first gives |↑⟩, σ_x on second gives |↓⟩, so |↑↓⟩.

σ_y¹ σ_y² |↓↑⟩: σ_y on first gives -i|↑⟩, σ_y on second gives i|↓⟩, so multiplying gives (-i)(i)|↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

σ_z¹ σ_z² |↓↑⟩: σ_z on first is -1, σ_z on second is +1, so total -1, so -|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, σ₁ · σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ = 2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↓↑| σ₁ · σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = ⟨↓↑| 2|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↓↑| |↓↑⟩ = 0 - 1 = -1. So same as before, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4. So ⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ is also -ħ²/4.

Therefore, the diagonal terms are:

⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩ = +ħ²/4,

⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ = -ħ²/4,

⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ = -ħ²/4.

Now, the off-diagonal terms. Let's compute ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩.

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩. So the first two spins in |a⟩ are |↑↑⟩, and in |b⟩ first two are |↑↓⟩. The operator S1·S2 acts only on first two spins. So:

⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ ⊗ ⟨↓|↑⟩. But the third component has ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0, so the entire term is zero. Wait, actually, the third spin in |a⟩ is down and in |b⟩ is up, so the scalar product between them is zero. Therefore, ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩ = 0.

Wait, but actually, the operator S1·S2 doesn't act on the third spin, so the term would be ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ * ⟨down | up⟩ = (⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ ) * 0. Since the third spin parts are orthogonal, yes, so it's zero.

Similarly, ⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩. Here, |c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩. The first spin is down, second is up, third is up. So the first two spins in |c⟩ are |↓↑⟩. So:

⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ * ⟨down|up⟩. Again, the third component scalar product is ⟨down|up⟩ = 0. So this is zero.

Similarly, ⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩ is the conjugate of ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩, which is 0.

Now, ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩. Let's see:

|b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩. Acting with S1·S2 on |c⟩ gives S1·S2 on the first two spins |↓↑⟩, then multiplied by the third spin up.

The scalar product ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ is ⟨↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ * ⟨↑|↑⟩.

The third spin part is ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1.

Now compute ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩.

We can use the Pauli matrices again. Let me compute ⟨↑↓| (σ₁ · σ₂) |↓↑⟩.

Earlier, we saw that σ₁ · σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = 2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩. So:

⟨↑↓| (σ₁ · σ₂) |↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓| (2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩) = 2⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ = 2(1) - 0 = 2.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2) = ħ²/2.

Therefore, ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2) * 1 = (ħ²/2). Wait, wait, actually, S1·S2 is (ħ²/4)(σ₁ · σ₂), so actually, the matrix element is (ħ²/4)*2 = ħ²/2. So yes, that term is ħ²/2. Hmm, but let me confirm:

Wait, the Pauli matrix calculation gave us ⟨↑↓| (σ₁ · σ₂)|↓↑⟩ = 2, so multiplying by ħ²/4 gives ⟨S1·S2⟩ here as (2)(ħ²/4) = ħ²/2. So that's correct.

Similarly, ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ would be the conjugate, which is the same because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, so that term is also ħ²/2?

Wait let me check:

⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ * ⟨↑|↑⟩.

This is ⟨↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩. Let's compute that.

Again using σ matrices: σ₁ · σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = 2|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩. So ⟨↓↑| (σ₁ · σ₂)|↑↓⟩ = ⟨↓↑|2|↓↑⟩ - ⟨↓↑|↑↓⟩ = 2⟨↓↑|↓↑⟩ - 0 = 2. So same result. Therefore, ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ is (ħ²/4)*2 = ħ²/2 as well.

Now, what about ⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩?

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ⟨↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ * ⟨↑|↓⟩. The third spins are up and down, so scalar product is 0. So this term is zero.

Lastly, ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ and ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ we've already considered, but let me check the rest.

Wait, actually, the terms left are:

⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩: which we saw is zero,

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩: zero,

⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩: zero,

⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩: ħ²/2,

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩: zero,

Wait, maybe I missed some terms. Let me reorganize:

The off-diagonal terms are all the cross terms except the diagonal. So, in the expansion:

⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩, ⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩,

⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩, ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩,

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩, ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩,

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩ and ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ are covered, but I think I got all.

So, compiling all terms:

The diagonal terms sum to:

(ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) = (ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4) = (-ħ²/4).

The off-diagonal terms are:

⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩ = 0,

⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩ = 0,

⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩ = 0,

⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ = (ħ²/2),

⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩ = 0,

⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ = (ħ²/2).

Wait, but hold on, the cross terms ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ and ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ each contribute ħ²/2, so total cross terms are 0 + 0 + 0 + ħ²/2 + 0 + ħ²/2 = ħ².

Therefore, total expectation value:

( -ħ²/4 + ħ² ) / 3 ?

Wait, no, the total expectation value is (1/3)( diagonal terms + off-diagonal terms )

Wait, no, wait the terms are summed as:

Total = (1/3)[ (diag terms) + (off-diag terms) ]

Wait, the diagonal terms summed to (-ħ²/4), and the off-diagonal terms summed to 0 (from first three terms) plus (from last three terms) (0 + ħ²/2 + ħ²/2 + 0) ?

Wait actually, in the cross terms:

⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ = ħ²/2,

⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ = ħ²/2,

Other cross terms are zero. So total cross terms sum to ħ²/2 + ħ²/2 = ħ².

Therefore, total expectation value:

[ (-ħ²/4) + (ħ²) ] divided by 3?

Wait no, wait the total is (1/3) times (sum over all terms). The diagonal terms sum to -ħ²/4, the cross terms sum to ħ², so total sum is (-ħ²/4 + ħ²) = (3/4 ħ²). Then divided by 3 gives (3/4 ħ²)/3 = (1/4)ħ².

Wait, let me recast all terms:

Total sum of all terms inside the brackets:

Diagonal terms:

⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩ = +ħ²/4,

⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ = -ħ²/4,

⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ = -ħ²/4,

Total diagonal: (1/4 -1/4 -1/4)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

Off-diagonal terms:

⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ = ħ²/2 + ħ²/2 = ħ²,

All other off-diagonal terms are 0,

So total off-diagonal contributions: +ħ².

Therefore, total sum: (-1/4 +1 )ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Thus, ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩ = (1/3)( 3/4 ħ² ) = (1/4) ħ².

Wait, so that's the expectation value of S1·S2. Since H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and due to symmetry, each of the three terms has the same expectation value. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*(3*(1/4)ħ² ) = (3/4 Aħ² ). But wait, the answer is supposed to be 2/3 Aħ². Hmm, so something went wrong here. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait first, the diagonal terms: for each of the three terms, each has two spins in a certain configuration. For the first term, a is |↑↑↓⟩: first two spins |↑↑⟩ gives +ħ²/4.

Second term, b is |↑↓↑⟩: first two spins |↑↓⟩ gives -ħ²/4,

Third term, c is |↓↑↑⟩: first two spins |↓↑⟩ similarly gives -ħ²/4,

So the diagonal terms sum to (1 -1 -1)/4 * ħ² = (-1)/4 * ħ², that's correct.

The cross terms between b and c: when acting on |b⟩ and |c⟩ with S1·S2, we saw that ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ and ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ each give ħ²/2, so total cross terms from those two is ħ². The other cross terms (between a and b, a and c, etc.) are zero. So total off-diagonal terms sum to ħ². Therefore, total expectation value is (-1/4 +1 )*ħ² /3? Wait no, actually, the total sum inside the brackets is (-1/4 * ħ²) + ħ² = (3/4 ħ²). Then multiplied by 1/3, gives (3/4 ħ²)/3 = 1/4 ħ². So ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 1/4 ħ². Then multiplying by 3 gives ⟨H⟩ = 3*(1/4 Aħ²) = 3/4 Aħ². But the answer is supposed to be 2/3 Aħ². So discrepancy here.

Hmm, so either my calculation is wrong, or perhaps the state is an eigenstate, and my method is wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me double-check the cross terms.

Let me re-examine ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩.

Compute ⟨↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩. The operator S1·S2 acts on the first two spins:

So the states for first two spins are |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ respectively.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩. As before, using Pauli matrices:

σ₁·σ₂ |↓↑⟩ = 2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩,

therefore ⟨↑↓|σ₁·σ₂|↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓|2|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ = 2(1) -0 = 2,

so ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2)
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The state is ψ = 1/√3 [up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3]. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about spin operators and eigenstates.

First, each spin-1/2 particle has spin operators S_i for each particle. The interaction terms in the Hamiltonian are the dot products of the spins between different particles. The S·S terms can be expanded using the formula S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2). Maybe that will be helpful here.

But before going into that, let me think about the given state ψ. It's a symmetric state where each term has two spins up and one down, but cyclically permuting each particle. Since all coefficients are equal and there's a normalization factor of 1/√3, this seems like a symmetric state under exchange of the particles. Perhaps this is a triplet state? Wait, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be different, so maybe I need to decompose the state into total spin eigenstates?

Alternatively, since the Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to the particles (since it's symmetric in all the pairwise interactions), the eigenstates can be classified by their symmetry type. The given state is symmetric, so maybe it's an eigenstate?

Alternatively, maybe instead of going through total spin, I can compute the expectation value of H directly on this state. Let's see.

First, let me note that H is proportional to the sum of S_i·S_j for i<j. So H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, to compute the expectation value 〈ψ|H|ψ〉, I need to compute each of these terms and sum them up, then multiply by A.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, the expectation values of each term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 should be the same. Therefore, I can compute one of them and multiply by 3.

Let me try that approach. Let's first compute 〈ψ|S1·S2|ψ〉. Since the state is symmetric, this should be the same as 〈ψ|S1·S3|ψ〉 and 〈ψ|S2·S3|ψ〉.

First, let me recall that S_i·S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). But since the state ψ is in the z-basis (up and down), maybe it's easier to compute the expectation of S_i·S_j by looking at the z-components?

Wait, actually, in the z-basis, S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the z-components and the other terms. But the expectation of the cross terms (like S_i^x S_j^y) might be zero if the state has certain symmetries?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each term in the state. Let me think.

The state ψ is a superposition of three terms:

Term1: up1 up2 down3

Term2: up1 down2 up3

Term3: down1 up2 up3

Each term is a tensor product of the individual spins. Let me denote up as |↑⟩ and down as |↓⟩.

So, ψ = 1/√3 (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Let me compute 〈ψ|S1·S2|ψ〉 first. To compute this expectation value, I can think of applying S1·S2 to each term in ψ and then taking the inner product with ψ.

Alternatively, since expectation value is linear, I can compute the expectation over each term and add them up, considering overlaps.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value directly by expanding.

Let me recall that for each pair, S1·S2 can be written as S1·S2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2 ) / 2, but actually the correct formula is S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). Hmm, maybe instead, using the identity:

S_i · S_j = ½ ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 )

But for spin-1/2 particles, S_i^2 = (ħ²/4)(3) for each particle. Wait, actually, S_i^2 = (S_i_x² + S_i_y² + S_i_z²) = ħ² ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) = (3/4)ħ². So S_i^2 is a constant operator with eigenvalue 3ħ²/4 for each particle.

Therefore, S_i · S_j = ½ ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3ħ²/2 )

Therefore, the expectation value of S_i · S_j would be ½ ( ⟨ (S_i + S_j)^2 ⟩ - 3ħ²/2 )

Hmm, maybe that's a useful identity here. Let me try that.

Therefore, 〈S_i · S_j〉 = (1/2)( ⟨ (S_i + S_j)^2 ⟩ - 3ħ²/2 )

So, if I can compute 〈(S1 + S2)^2〉, that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps even better, let me note that (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1 · S2, so rearranged, that gives S1 · S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2. Wait, but that's exactly the identity. So maybe computing 〈(S1 + S2)^2〉 is key here.

Alternatively, let's see if there is a smarter way. Since the state has a specific form, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1 · S2 acting on the state ψ.

First, let me consider the action of S1 · S2 on each term in the superposition.

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. Let's compute S1 · S2 on this term.

Since S1 and S2 act on the first and second particles respectively. The first particle is up, second is up, third is down. Since these are eigenstates of S^z, maybe their S^x and S^y components are more complicated, but maybe we can compute S1 · S2.

Alternatively, since S_i · S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z ), let's compute each term's expectation.

But perhaps even better, note that in the basis of S^z, the expectation value of S_i · S_j can be computed by looking at the z-components and the spin-up/down products.

Wait, perhaps this is easier:

Each term in the state is a product state. Let me compute the expectation value of S1 · S2 in each term and then sum over the terms (since ψ is a superposition of these terms).

Wait, actually, the expectation value ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩ is equal to the sum over i,j,k,l of (coeff_i)(coeff_j^*) ⟨term_i | S1·S2 | term_j⟩. Since the state is a sum of three terms with coefficients 1/√3, so when you take the expectation, you need to consider all cross terms. Hmm, this might get complicated, but maybe due to the symmetry of the state, some terms will cancel or add constructively.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach.

Let me think of the total spin operators. Since the Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise interactions, maybe the eigenstates are the total spin states? For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state ψ given is symmetric, so maybe it's a triplet state (total spin 1/2?) Wait, but three spin-1/2 can form different total spins.

Wait, actually, the total spin for three spin-1/2 particles can be 3/2 (symmetric) or 1/2 (antisymmetric in some way). So the symmetric part would have total spin 3/2, and the antisymmetric parts have total spin 1/2. Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, let me recall that when combining three spins, the possible total spins are:

3/2 (all spins aligned) and 1/2 (with some cancellation). The symmetric combination (where each permutation leaves the state invariant) would correspond to the highest total spin, which is 3/2. But the given state is symmetric, so maybe it's in the 3/2 multiplet?

However, the given state is ψ = 1/√3 (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩), which when you add them, you can see that each term has two up spins and one down. This is actually a state that's a symmetric combination, so it should be part of the total spin 1/2 triplet? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, the total spin can be determined by acting the total spin operators on it. Let me try to compute the total spin squared operator S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

First, S^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3.

Therefore, if we can compute ⟨S^2⟩, and since S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ²,

then ⟨S^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨ H/A ⟩, since the cross terms are the H terms divided by A. Wait, but H is A*(S1·S2 + ... ), so 2*(S1·S2 + ...) = 2 H/A.

But maybe this can help.

Alternatively, let me compute S^2 |ψ⟩ and see if it's proportional to |ψ⟩, which would mean that |ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of S^2.

Alternatively, let me compute the total z-component first. The total S_z for the state ψ is:

Each term in the superposition has two up and one down. Each up contributes +1/2 ħ and down contributes -1/2 ħ. So each term has (2*(+1/2) -1*(1/2)) ħ = (1/2) ħ. Since all terms have the same S_z, so the total S_z of the state is 1/2 ħ. Therefore, the z-component is 1/2 ħ. So if this is an eigenstate of S^2, then the eigenvalue would be s(s+1)ħ² where s is 1/2 or 3/2. Wait, but S_z is 1/2, so s could be 3/2 or 1/2. Hmm, but since the eigenstate with s=3/2 would have maximum S_z of 3/2 ħ, but here it's 1/2 ħ, so maybe s=1/2?

Wait, maybe this is part of the s=1/2 multiplet. Let's see.

Alternatively, let me compute S^2 |ψ⟩. To do that, we can compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |ψ⟩.

First, expanding the square:

(S1+S2+S3)^2 |ψ⟩ = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3) |ψ⟩

We know S_i^2 |term⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |term⟩ for each term, so the first three terms just give 3*(3/4 ħ²) |term⟩ for each term in the superposition.

Then the interaction terms are 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |ψ⟩, which is exactly 2 H/A * |ψ⟩, but we need to compute their action. Wait, but maybe this is getting us in a loop. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S^2|ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, let me compute the expectation value of S^2:

⟨ψ|S^2|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ) |ψ⟩

We know that the first three terms give 3*(3/4 ħ²) * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 9/4 ħ², since the state is normalized.

The rest is 2 times the expectation of H/A, which is 2/A * ⟨H⟩. So,

⟨S²⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2/A * ⟨H⟩

But if |ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of H, then ⟨H⟩ would be the eigenvalue E, so ⟨S²⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2/A * E.

Also, if |ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue s(s+1)ħ², then:

s(s+1)ħ² = 9/4 ħ² + 2/A * E

But unless we know s, this might not help. However, since the state has S_z = 1/2 ħ, s must be at least 1/2. If s = 1/2, then the eigenvalue would be 3/4 ħ², but let's see.

Wait, but let's compute ⟨S²⟩ manually. Maybe that's better.

To compute ⟨ψ|S²|ψ⟩:

First, let's note that S² is the sum of the squares plus the cross terms. Since each term in ψ is a product state, let me compute S² acting on each term and then take the inner product.

Let me first compute S² |↑↑↓⟩:

First, S1=S2=+1/2, S3=-1/2. So the total spin squared:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 + S3^2 + 2 (S1 + S2)·S3 )

Wait, actually, expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2:

= S1² + S2² + S3² + 2S1·S2 + 2S1·S3 + 2S2·S3.

But each term is an operator, so when acting on |↑↑↓⟩, we can compute each S_i^2 as 3ħ²/4, so S1²|↑↑↓⟩ = (3ħ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩, similarly for S2 and S3.

Then the cross terms:

2S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩: Since S1 and S2 are both up, their dot product operator S1·S2 on |↑↑↓⟩ is (for spin up and up):

In the z-basis, S1·S2 for up-up would be:

(S1_z S2_z + ... ) but actually, in terms of matrices, maybe better to compute it as:

For spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices divided by ħ, but perhaps more straightforward.

Alternatively, the expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↑↓⟩ is ( (S1_z S2_z + ... )) but since in the |↑↑↓⟩ state, S1_z and S2_z are both +1/2 ħ, so S1_z S2_z = (1/2 ħ)^2. The other terms (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y) would also contribute. Alternatively, since the state is an eigenstate of S1_z and S2_z, but not necessarily of S1_x or S_y. So maybe this is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity S_i · S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² all over 2.

Wait, let me compute S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

First, S1 and S2 are both up, so (S1 + S2)^2 = (S1 + S2)^2. Since they are spin up, the total spin of S1 + S2 is 1 (since two up spins add to 1). Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 = (1)(1+1) ħ² = 2ħ², so S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ] / 2 = (2ħ² - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² )) / 2 = (2 - 3/2)ħ² / 2 = ( (1/2)ħ² ) / 2 = 1/4 ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives (1/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but actually, that gives the eigenvalue. But since we are acting with the operator S1·S2 on a state that is an eigenstate of (S1 + S2)^2, S1^2, and S2^2, then yes, the expectation would be 1/4 ħ². However, to compute S² |↑↑↓⟩, we have to compute each term:

S² |↑↑↓⟩ = [ S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ] |↑↑↓⟩

Now:

S1² = (3/4)ħ²,

S2² = (3/4)ħ²,

S3² = (3/4)ħ²,

So sum of squares: 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Then the cross terms:

2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already calculated S1·S2 gives 1/4 ħ². What about S1·S3?

S1 is up, S3 is down. So S1_z = +1/2 ħ, S3_z = -1/2 ħ. Let's compute S1·S3.

Again, let's use the identity S1·S3 = ( (S1 + S3)^2 - S1² - S3² ) / 2

The total spin of S1 and S3. Since S1 is up and S3 is down, their total spin could be 0 or 1? Wait, S1 and S3 are separate particles, so their individual spins are either aligned or anti-aligned? Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the operator.

Wait, actually, S1 and S3 are independent, so S1·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ would be computed as follows:

The state is |↑ (S1) | ↑ (S2) | ↓ (S3)

Therefore, the operators S1·S3 act on the first and third spins. Since the first is up and third is down.

Again, using the formula for S1·S3:

(S1 + S3)^2 - S1² - S3² all over 2.

Compute (S1 + S3)^2:

The total spin of S1 and S3 is (S1 + S3). Since S1 is up and S3 is down, their total spin can be 0 or 1? Wait, actually, their total spin squared is (S1 + S3)^2. Since they are in a product state of up and down, which is an eigenstate of S_z, but not necessarily of the total spin squared.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute (S1 + S3)^2 |↑↓⟩ (for the first and third spins):

The first spin is up, third is down. So the combined state for these two is |↑⟩⊗|↓⟩. The total spin squared for this pair is:

(S1 + S3)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (S1_z + S3_z)^2 |↑↓⟩ + (S1_x S3_x + S1_y S3_y + ...) ?

Wait, actually, the operator (S1 + S3)^2 expands to S1² + S3² + 2 S1·S3, so rearranged, S1·S3 = [(S1 + S3)^2 - S1² - S3²]/2. But since S1² and S3² are known:

(S1² + S3²) = (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² = 3/2 ħ².

If I can compute (S1 + S3)^2 |↑↓⟩, then I can find the value.

But in the state |↑↓⟩, the operator (S1 + S3)^2 might not be diagonal. Instead of computing the action, maybe compute the expectation value.

The expectation value of (S1 + S3)^2 in the state |↑↓⟩ is:

⟨↑|⟨↓| (S1 + S3)^2 |↑⟩|↓⟩

= ⟨↑|S1² |↑⟩⟨↓|S3² |↓⟩ + ⟨↑|(S1^x)^2|↑⟩⟨↓|(S3^x)^2 |↓⟩ + ...? Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, since |↑↓⟩ is a singlet (if combined as a two-particle state?), but actually no, the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2. Wait, the state |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet (since spin 1) and singlet (spin 0). The |↑↓⟩ state has total spin 0 or 1?

Wait, actually, the total spin of two spins 1/2 can be 0 or 1. The |↑↓⟩ can be written as part of both.

The state |↑↓⟩ can be expressed as (1/√2)(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩) for spin 0, plus (1/√2)(|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩) for spin 1 along z. Wait, actually, no, to get the total spin:

The total spin 0 state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2,

the total spin 1, m=+1 is |↑↑⟩,

the total spin 1, m=0 is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2,

and m=-1 is |↓↓⟩.

Therefore, the state |↑↓⟩ can be written as a combination of these: |↑↓⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 (which is the m=0 component) minus (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2 (the singlet). Wait, actually:

Wait, to write |↑↓⟩ in terms of total spin states:

Let me denote:

|↑↑⟩ = |1,1⟩,

|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ divided by sqrt(2) is |1,0⟩,

|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ divided by sqrt(2) is |0,0⟩,

and |↓↓⟩ = |1,-1⟩.

Therefore, |↑↓⟩ = ( |1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

Therefore, the expectation value of (S1 + S3)^2 in the state |↑↓⟩:

⟨↑↓| (S1 + S3)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ⟨ (1,0) + (0,0) over sqrt(2) | (S1 + S3)^2 | same⟩

Since (S1 + S3)^2 is the same as the total spin squared operator for those two particles, so for the state |1,0⟩, the eigenvalue is (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ²,

and for |0,0⟩, it's 0*(0+1)ħ² = 0.

Therefore,

⟨↑↓| (S1 + S3)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(⟨1,0|2ħ² + ⟨0,0|0ħ² ) = (1/2)(2ħ²) = ħ².

Therefore, the expectation of (S1 + S3)^2 is ħ², so then S1·S3 is [ (S1 + S3)^2 - S1² - S3² ] /2 = (ħ² - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ²)/2 = ( (1 - 1.5)ħ²)/2 = (-0.5ħ²)/2 = -1/4 ħ².

Therefore, S1·S3 gives an expectation of -1/4 ħ² in the state |↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2·S3 would be the same, since S2 is up and S3 is down, analogous to S1 and S3.

Wait, let me confirm. For S2·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩, the second and third spins are up and down. So that's the same as S1 and S3 above. So same result: -1/4 ħ².

Thus, putting it all together for the cross terms:

2*( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is 2*( (1/4 ħ²) + (-1/4 ħ²) + (-1/4 ħ²) ) = 2*( -1/4 ħ² ) = -1/2 ħ².

Therefore, the total S² acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

Total is (9/4 ħ²) from the squares plus (-1/2 ħ²) from cross terms, so 9/4 - 1/2 = 9/4 - 2/4 = 7/4 ħ².

Therefore, S² |↑↑↓⟩ = (7/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, we can compute S² acting on the other terms in ψ.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩.

Let's do that quickly. The state is first up, second down, third up.

So, following the same steps:

S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

Compute S1·S2: first and second spins are up and down. So like S1·S3 before, so gives -1/4 ħ².

S1·S3: S1 and S3 are both up, so same as S1·S2 in the first term: +1/4 ħ².

S2·S3: S2 down and S3 up. So same as before, -1/4 ħ².

Thus cross terms:

2*( -1/4 +1/4 -1/4 ) = 2*(-1/4) = -1/2 ħ².

Same as before. So total S² acting on |↑↓↑⟩ is 9/4 ħ² -1/2 ħ² = 7/4 ħ².

Similarly, the third term |↓↑↑⟩ will give the same result.

Therefore, S² acting on any of the three basis states in ψ gives 7/4 ħ² times the state.

Therefore, S² ψ = 7/4 ħ² ψ, so ψ is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue 7/4 ħ². Wait, but 7/4 is (sqrt(7)/2)^2, but normally, for spin eigenstates, s(s+1). Let me see: 7/4 is 1.75. 1.75 = s(s+1). Since s is either 1/2 or 3/2. Let me check:

If s=1, then s(s+1)=2. So not that. If s= sqrt(7/4 - 1/4)=... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, but for three spins, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or even other possibilities? Wait, three spin-1/2 particles can have total spin 3/2 or 1/2. The possible values are s=3/2 (all aligned), s=1/2 (with some cancellations). The symmetric combination would be s=3/2, but here we have an eigenvalue of 7/4. Let me see:

Wait, s=3/2 would give s(s+1) = 3/2 *5/2 = 15/4 = 3.75. So that's higher than 7/4 (which is 1.75). Hmm, so that suggests that my calculation must be wrong. Wait, but then where did I go wrong?

Wait, actually, the total spin squared for three spins... Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2, so their eigenvalues should be either 3/2*(3/2 +1) = 15/4 ħ² or 1/2*(1/2 +1)= 3/4 ħ². So getting 7/4 is impossible. So my calculation must have an error.

Wait a minute, so that suggests that my approach is wrong. Let me trace back.

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in the calculation of S1·S2 on |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, let me re-examine S1·S2 on |↑↑↓⟩.

Earlier, I considered S1 and S2 both up, so their total spin squared would be (S1 + S2)^2 = (total spin 1)^2 = 2ħ², so then S1·S2 is (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² -3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 * ħ² = 0.5/2 = 0.25 ħ². That seems correct.

Wait, but then when I calculated S² for |↑↑↓⟩, I had:

S² = [S1² + S2² + S3²] + 2*( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

The first part is 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ². The cross terms:

2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = 2*( 0.25 + (-0.25) + (-0.25) ) ħ² = 2*(-0.25) ħ² = -0.5 ħ².

Thus total S² = 9/4 - 1/2 = 7/4 ħ². Hmm. But that's a contradiction because the total spin can't be 7/4. That suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe my assumption that S1·S2 can be calculated via (S1 + S2)^2 was incorrect?

Wait, no, the identity is correct. S·S = ½( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² )

Wait, but in operator terms, this is valid, so the expectation value should hold. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the error is that when we have three spins, the total spin operator S is S1 + S2 + S3, so S² is their sum squared, but when I calculated S² acting on |↑↑↓⟩, I got 7/4. But since the actual possible eigenvalues are 15/4 and 3/4, this suggests that my computation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the cross terms.

Wait let me recompute the cross terms for S² on |↑↑↓⟩:

The cross terms are 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The terms S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

Earlier, I found S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ²,

S1·S3 = -1/4 ħ²,

S2·S3 = -1/4 ħ²,

so their sum is 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Multiply by 2 gives -1/2. So that is correct.

So total S² acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is indeed 9/4 -1/2 =7/4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not an eigenstate of S²? But when I acted on it with S², it gave a multiple of itself? Wait no, S² is a scalar operator, so if you act it on each term, which is a product state, then the result is 7/4 ħ² times each term, so the entire state would be an eigenstate with eigenvalue 7/4. But since 7/4 is not one of the allowed eigenvalues, that suggests that my calculations must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up ħ units?

Wait, in the problem statement, the Hamiltonian is written as A*(S1·S2 + ...). If the S operators are in units where ħ=1, then perhaps I should have set ħ=1 for simplicity.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up in the cross term calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state ψ.

The state ψ is symmetric, so the expectation value of S1·S2 will be the same as S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, let's compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩:

First, write ψ as ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / √3.

Then,

⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩ = (1/3) [ ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↓↑↑⟩

+ ⟨↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑⟩

+ ⟨↓↑↑|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑⟩ ]

This is going to be tedious, but maybe due to symmetry, some terms cancel.

First, compute each term:

First, let's compute ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩. As before, this is 1/4 ħ².

Second term: ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩.

Here, S1·S2 acts on |↑↓↑⟩. The first two spins are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

So S1·S2 on |↑↓⟩ (for the first two spins):

Let me compute this. The first two spins are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So similar to before, compute S1·S2 for this pair.

Using the identity, (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² over 2.

The total spin squared for |↑↓⟩ is (as before) : (1/√2)( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) is the m=0 component of spin 1, which has eigenvalue 2ħ², and the singlet has 0.

Therefore, for |↑↓⟩, the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 is similar
