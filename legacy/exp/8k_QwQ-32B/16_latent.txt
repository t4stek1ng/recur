Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove? Why the correct answer is 22?<|im_end|>

Okay, let's see. Uriah needs to lighten his book bag by 15 pounds. He has comic books that each weigh 1/4 pound and toys that each weigh 1/2 pound. He's already removing 30 comic books, and we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove so that the total weight removed is 15 pounds. The answer is supposed to be 22, but let me work through it step by step to make sure I understand why.

First, let's figure out how much weight Uriah removes by taking out the 30 comic books. Each comic book is 1/4 pound, so 30 of them would be 30 times 1/4. Let me calculate that:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

So, removing 30 comic books takes off 7.5 pounds from the bag. But he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. That means he still needs to remove an additional 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, the remaining weight he needs to remove has to come from the toys. Each toy is 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to get rid of 7.5 pounds, I can set up an equation where the number of toys multiplied by their weight equals 7.5 pounds. Let me write that down:

Number of toys * (1/2) = 7.5

To solve for the number of toys, I can divide both sides by 1/2, which is the same as multiplying by 2:

Number of toys = 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

Wait a minute, that gives me 15 toys, but the correct answer is supposed to be 22. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check my calculations again.

Starting over:

Total needed to remove: 15 pounds.

Weight from comics removed: 30 comics * 1/4 lb each.

30 divided by 4 is 7.5. So that's correct.

So remaining weight to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. That still holds.

Each toy is 1/2 lb, so number of toys needed = 7.5 divided by 0.5.

7.5 divided by 0.5 is indeed 15. Because 0.5 goes into 7.5 fifteen times. 15*0.5 = 7.5.

Hmm, so then why is the answer 22? Maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

"Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove? Why the correct answer is 22?"

Then, so then why is the answer 22? maybe I'm missing a unit conversion or something. Let me think.

"Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove? Why the correct answer is 22?"

Okay, so then why is the answer 22? Maybe instead of 30 comic books. Let me try that.
