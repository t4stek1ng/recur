Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost? Why the correct answer is 3?<|im_end|>

Okay, let me try to figure out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs. Hmm, so Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. Let me jot down what I know:

First, she bought two packs of her favorite flavor, which is strawberry. Then, she bought one pack of grape gum that cost $2 per pack. Oh, and she also got a small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum for. The total she paid was $7. They want to know how much each strawberry pack costs, and apparently, the answer is $3. But let me work through it step by step to confirm that.

Alright, let's break it down. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let me call the cost of each strawberry pack "S". Since she bought two packs of strawberry, that would be 2 times S, right? So 2S.

Then, the grape gum is given as $2 per pack, and she bought one pack of that. So that's straightforward, just $2.

Now, the green apple gum is a bit trickier. The problem says she paid half as much for the small pack of green apple gum. Wait, half as much as what? The wording says "half as much for a small pack of green apple gum" compared to something. Since the previous sentence mentions she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum, I think "half as much" refers to half the price of the grape gum. So, half of $2 would be $1. So the green apple gum is $1 per pack. Since it's a small pack, maybe it's just one pack? The problem says she bought "a small pack," so that's one pack at $1. So that's $1.

So adding all the costs together: strawberry (2S) + grape ($2) + green apple ($1) equals total $7. Let me write that equation:

2S + 2 + 1 = 7

Simplifying that, the constants add up to 3, so:

2S + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2S = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 2

Wait, hold on, that gives me S = $2? But the answer is supposed to be $3. Did I do something wrong here?

Let me check again. Maybe I misunderstood the "half as much." The problem says she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. Maybe "half as much" compared to the grape gum? Because that's the previous item mentioned. So grape is $2, so half of that is $1, so that would be correct. Then the total would be 2S + 2 + 1 = 7, so 2S = 4, so S is $2. Hmm, but the answer is supposed to be 3. Maybe I misread something else.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum.

Then, let me read the problem again:

No, let me read the problem again:
