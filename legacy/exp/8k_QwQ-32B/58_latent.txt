There is a multiple-choice question: Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?. The options are: A. 500 Hz, B. 1,750 Hz, C. 2,750 Hz, D. 3,500 Hz. Why the correct answer is C. 2,750 Hz?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I need to figure out why the answer is C. 2,750 Hz for this diffraction question. Let me start by recalling what I know about diffraction and sound waves. 

First, the problem states that sound waves are moving at 350 m/s. The speaker enclosure has a long rectangular slit that's 0.14 meters across. We need to find the frequency at which the sound first disappears at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal. The options are given, and the correct one is supposed to be C. Hmm.

Alright, diffraction through a slit... I remember that for single-slit diffraction, the condition for destructive interference (which would cause the sound to disappear) is given by the equation: 

$$
d \sin\theta = n\lambda
$$

where:
- \( d \) is the width of the slit,
- \( \theta \) is the angle from the central maximum (here, it's given as 45 degrees from the normal, so maybe we need to adjust that),
- \( n \) is the order of the minimum (an integer: 1, 2, 3,...),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the sound.

Wait, but I need to make sure I have the right formula here. Let me confirm. Yes, for single-slit diffraction minima, the formula is indeed \( d \sin\theta = n\lambda \), where n = 1, 2, 3,... So that's correct. 

But hold on, the angle here is given from the normal. In diffraction formulas, is the angle measured from the normal or from the direction of the slit? Let me think. In the standard single-slit setup, the central maximum is along the normal (perpendicular to the slit), and the minima are at angles away from that. So the angle theta in the formula is measured from the central maximum, which is the normal direction. Therefore, the given angle of 45 degrees from the normal is exactly the angle we need to plug into the formula. That's good.

So we can proceed. The question is asking for the frequency at which the sound first disappears at that angle. The "first" disappearance would correspond to the first minimum, so n = 1. But let me check the question again. Wait, the wording says "first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees". So they want the frequency where the first minimum occurs at 45 degrees. So n=1.

Well hold on, the angle here is given from the normal. In diffraction formulas, is the angle measured from the normal or from the direction of the slit? Let me try with sin. In the standard single-slit setup, the central maximum is along the normal (perpendicular to the slit), and the minima are at angles away from that. So the angle theta in the formula is measured from the central maximum, which is the normal direction. Therefore, the given angle of 45 degrees from the normal is exactly the angle we need to plug into the formula. That's good.

No hold on, the angle here is given from the normal. In diffraction formulas, is the angle measured from the normal or from the direction of the slit? Let me write this as. In the standard single-slit setup, the central maximum is along the normal (perpendicular to the slit), and the minima are at angles away from that. So the angle theta in the formula is measured from the central maximum, which is the normal direction. Therefore, the given angle of 45 degrees from the normal is exactly the angle we need to plug into the formula. That's good.
