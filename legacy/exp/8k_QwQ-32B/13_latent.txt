Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are 40 pupils in the class. First, half of them like blue. Let me write that down. 

Half of 40 is 20, right? So, 20 pupils like blue. That leaves the other half, which is also 20 pupils, who don't like blue. The problem says one-fourth of the remaining likes green. Hmm, the remaining after the blue group is 20 pupils. So one-fourth of those 20 like green. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, 5 pupils like green. 

Now, the rest like yellow. The rest would be the remaining pupils after subtracting those who like blue and green. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the "remaining" here might refer to the remaining after the blue group. Let me check the problem again. 

It says, "One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow." So, after the half that likes blue, the remaining is 20. Then of that 20, one-fourth likes green, so the rest of that 20 would be the ones who like yellow. So, yes. 

So the remaining after the green-likers would be 20 minus 5, which is 15. But wait, the answer is supposed to be 22. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me go through it again step by step. 

Total pupils: 40.

Half like blue: 40 / 2 = 20. So 20 like blue. 

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. 

Then, one-fourth of these remaining 20 like green. So, 20 * 1/4 = 5 pupils like green. 

Therefore, the rest of the remaining pupils (after accounting for blue and green) like yellow. So, remaining after green is 20 - 5 = 15. 

But the problem says the answer should be 22. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem?

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully:

"There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?"

Now, let me read the problem again carefully:

"There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?"

Hence, let me read the problem again carefully:

"There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?"
