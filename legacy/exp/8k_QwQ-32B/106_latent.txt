Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Why the correct answer is 10^-9 eV?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this question here about quantum states and their energy differences. The problem states that two quantum states have different lifetimes, 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, and we want to be able to clearly distinguish their energy levels. The question is asking what their energy difference should be so that they can be resolved, and the answer given is 10^-9 eV. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is the case.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with energy levels and their lifetimes, there's something related to the uncertainty principle. The energy-time uncertainty principle, right? Which says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is on the order of Planck's constant h-bar. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But maybe they just use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt here?

Let me recall. The energy-time uncertainty principle is a bit tricky because time isn't an operator in quantum mechanics, so it's a bit different from position-momentum. But for a particle's lifetime, which is the time the system stays in a state before it decays, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the lifetime τ by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So if a state has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller, meaning the energy level is more precisely defined. Conversely, a shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty.

So, for the two states with different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties will be different. To distinguish them, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap too much and you couldn't tell them apart.

Let me write that down. Let's denote the two states as State 1 with lifetime τ₁ = 10^-9 sec and energy E₁, and State 2 with τ₂ = 10^-8 sec and energy E₂. The energy uncertainties would be ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ and ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂. To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE = |E₂ - E₁| must satisfy:

ΔE > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂

So substituting the uncertainties:

ΔE > (ħ / τ₁) + (ħ / τ₂)

Hmm, okay. Let's compute the numerical values here. First, what's the value of ħ? Let me recall. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, so ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s. But we need to convert this into eV·seconds because the energy difference is asked in eV.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so to convert from joules to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19. Therefore, ħ in units of eV·s is (1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now let's compute the individual uncertainties:

ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV

ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV

Therefore, the total uncertainty to consider is the sum of both uncertainties? Wait, but actually, when distinguishing two energy levels, the required energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each level?

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think. If the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties, then the total uncertainty in their separation would be the square root of the sum of the squares? Because uncertainties add in quadrature when independent?

Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think. If the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties, then the total uncertainty in their separation would be the square root of the sum of the squares? Because uncertainties add in quadrature when independent?

Oh, maybe not exactly. Let me recompute ΔE for τ =1e-9 s. If the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties, then the total uncertainty in their separation would be the square root of the sum of the squares? Because uncertainties add in quadrature when independent?
