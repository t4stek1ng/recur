[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the Bera-Jarque test null hypothesis question is option D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Let me start by recalling what the Bera-Jarque test is about. I think it's a statistical test used to check if a dataset has the same skewness and kurtosis as a normal distribution. The null hypothesis is probably that the data comes from a normally distributed population, right?

Wait, the normal distribution has a skewness of zero because it's symmetric, and its kurtosis is three. But hold on, kurtosis can be a bit confusing because sometimes people refer to excess kurtosis, which subtracts three. So maybe that's where the confusion comes in. Let me check that again.

The Jarque-Bera test (I think it's usually called Jarque-Bera, not Bera-Jarque, but maybe it's the same test) combines skewness and kurtosis to test for normality. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which would have skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3. But the options here are different. The options given are A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm, wait a second. The normal distribution has skewness zero and kurtosis three, so the null hypothesis should be B? But the user is saying the correct answer is D. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, maybe there's a different parameterization. Let me recall the formula for the Jarque-Bera test statistic. The Jarque-Bera statistic is defined as:

JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (C^2)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, S should be 0 and C (which is excess kurtosis) should be 0, meaning the actual kurtosis is 3. So the null hypothesis would require S = 0 and kurtosis = 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.

But according to the user, the correct answer is D. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the question again. The user wrote "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." The options are A to D as listed. The correct answer is D? That would mean skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3? That contradicts my understanding. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Maybe it's not the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution, but something else? Or perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, the Jarque-Bera test uses the skewness and excess kurtosis. Let me check the exact formulation again.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion between kurtosis and excess kurtosis. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, so excess kurtosis is 0. So if the test is checking that skewness is 0 and excess kurtosis is 0, then the null hypothesis would be that skewness is 0 and kurtosis (the actual kurtosis) is 3. Therefore, the answer should be B. So why does the user say D is correct?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Jarque-Bera test's standardized values? For example, the test statistic is based on the skewness divided by its standard error and the excess kurtosis divided by its standard error. But that would still lead to the null hypothesis requiring skewness zero and excess kurtosis zero (so kurtosis 3).

Alternatively, perhaps the options are mistyped? Let me think again. If the correct answer is D, then skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 3, which would be inconsistent with the normal distribution. Maybe there's a different test?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question? Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted? Let me check the question again. It says "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has". So the null hypothesis of the test is that the distribution has certain skewness and kurtosis. Since the Jarque-Bera test is a test of normality, the null is that the data is normally distributed, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So answer B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context? Wait, if the test is for some other distribution? But the standard Jarque-Bera test is for normality. Unless in some other context where they are testing for a different distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That would be strange. 

Alternatively, maybe there was a translation error or typo in the options? For instance, if "zero" was mistakenly written as "one"? Or perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness? Wait, maybe they are using the standardized skewness, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the person who set the question confused skewness with another parameter? Let me check the possible options again:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm. The problem must be either a misunderstanding of the test or a trick in the question. Wait, the Bera-Jarque test is actually the Jarque-Bera test. Maybe the user reversed the names? That doesn't matter, though. 

Wait, let me think again about kurtosis. Some sources define kurtosis as the fourth standardized moment, which for a normal distribution is 3. So the null hypothesis should be that the kurtosis is 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution where skewness is 1? For instance, if the test is for a different distribution, like a logistic distribution? Wait, logistic has kurtosis 4.8, so that's not it. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is testing for a uniform distribution? The uniform distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis -1.2, so that's not either. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized moments? But standardized skewness is just the third central moment divided by the cube of the standard deviation, so the skewness is a dimensionless quantity. 

Alternatively, is there a possibility that the question is referring to the Jarque-Bera test statistic's numerator? Like, the test statistic is based on squared terms, so the expected value under the null is zero? Wait, no. The JB statistic is asymptotically chi-squared distributed with two degrees of freedom under the null, so the expected JB statistic under the null is 2 (since chi-squared with 2 df has mean 2). 

Alternatively, maybe the question is confused between the parameters of the test statistic and the parameters of the distribution. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness and standardized excess kurtosis? For example, in some formulations, they standardize the skewness and kurtosis for the test. Wait, the Jarque-Bera test uses the sample skewness and sample excess kurtosis (i.e., kurtosis minus 3). So under the null, the expected skewness is 0 and the excess kurtosis is 0, so the actual kurtosis is 3. 

Hmm, unless in the question, the kurtosis is given as excess kurtosis? If the question says "kurtosis of three," maybe they are referring to excess kurtosis? Then, the normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of 0, so that would not be D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using software or a textbook that defines kurtosis differently? For example, in some software, the kurtosis function might return excess kurtosis by default. So if the question is saying "kurtosis of three," that would actually mean excess kurtosis is 3, implying the actual kurtosis is 6? That would be inconsistent with normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the correct answer should be B, but the user is informed that D is correct. This could be a trick question or a mistake. Let me see if there's any possibility that the skewness is 1?

Wait, if the distribution is something like a logistic distribution, which has a skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 4.2, but still not 1 or 3. Maybe a different distribution? 

Wait, the exponential distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? For example, standardized skewness is divided by its standard error. But under the null, that would be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is miswritten. Alternatively, maybe "Bera-Jarque" is a different test? Maybe a different test where the null is different? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Jarque-Bera test but the null is that the distribution is not normal, so the alternative is normal? That would be strange. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between the parameters of the test statistic and the distribution. For example, the Jarque-Bera test statistic is a function of the sample skewness and excess kurtosis, but the null is that the population skewness is 0 and population kurtosis is 3 (so excess kurtosis 0). 

Wait, if the question is phrased as "the distribution has...", then the correct answer must be B. The user is saying D is the correct answer, but that contradicts the standard properties. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Bera-Jarque test as a test for some other distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? Let me check if there's a distribution with those parameters. 

Skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3. Let me think of common distributions:

- Normal: 0, 3

- Uniform: 0, (1.8)

Wait, the uniform distribution on [a,b] has skewness 0 and kurtosis -1.2?

Wait, maybe a skewed distribution but with kurtosis same as normal? Like, a distribution that is slightly skewed but with same kurtosis?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized moments where skewness is 1? But that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition where skewness is scaled. Wait, sometimes skewness is defined as the third moment divided by the standard deviation cubed. For a normal distribution, that's zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong and the correct answer is B, but the options are labeled incorrectly. 

Alternatively, maybe the user had a different source where the test is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Jarque-Bera test is testing for a different distribution. Wait, let me check the Jarque-Bera test again. 

According to Wikipedia: The Jarque–Bera test statistic is used to test whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The test statistic is always non-negative. If it is far from zero, it signals the data do not have a sample skewness and kurtosis close to that of a normal distribution, whose skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis must be that skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3, so B is correct. 

Therefore, the user's question must have an error. Unless there is a misunderstanding in the question. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the skewness and kurtosis of the Jarque-Bera test statistic's distribution under the null? 

Wait, the Jarque-Bera test statistic has a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom under the null. The chi-squared distribution with n degrees of freedom has skewness sqrt(8/n) and kurtosis 3 + 12/n. For n=2, that would be skewness sqrt(4) = 2, and kurtosis 3 +6=9? 

But that's the distribution of the test statistic. But the question is about the distribution under the null hypothesis, which is the normal distribution. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly worded, and the options given are for another test? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different version of the test where the null is different. For example, maybe testing for some other distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? 

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused skewness with another parameter. For example, if the question was about the Lilliefors test, but that's for normality with unspecified parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution like the logistic distribution (skewness 0, kurtosis 4.2) or the Laplace distribution (skewness 0, kurtosis 6). 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the skewness and kurtosis of the estimator under the null? That seems less likely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question's options are mislabeled. For example, option D is supposed to be zero skewness and three kurtosis, but it's labeled wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my understanding? Let me check kurtosis again. 

The formula for kurtosis is E[(X - μ)^4]/σ^4. For a normal distribution, that's 3. So yes, the kurtosis is 3. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis must require skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so B is correct. 

Perhaps the user received the question with a typo where option D was intended to be B. Alternatively, the user might have seen a different version of the test? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test. For example, the D'Agostino test? The D'Agostino-Pearson test also tests for normality using skewness and kurtosis, so same null hypothesis. 

Alternatively, the Bera-Jarque test is the same as the Jarque-Bera test, so no difference there. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis in the test statistic. The test statistic involves (Skewness^2)/6 + (Kurtosis-3)^2/24, multiplied by n/6. Wait, actually, the standard formula is JB = (n/6)(S^2 + 0.25*(K - 3)^2), where S is sample skewness, K is sample kurtosis. 

So under the null, S=0 and K=3, so the terms would be zero. 

Thus, the null is that the distribution has S=0 and K=3. Therefore, answer B is correct. 

Therefore, the user might have been given incorrect information, or the question is mistyped. Unless I'm missing something here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the parameters of a different distribution. Let's see, if a distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, what would that be? Let me see:

Suppose we have a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

The normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So this distribution would be skewed to the right but with the same kurtosis as normal.

Is there a standard distribution with these parameters? 

The log-normal distribution has positive skewness and higher kurtosis, so if the mean is zero, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, a chi-squared distribution with certain degrees of freedom? 

A chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom has skewness sqrt(8/k) and kurtosis 3 + 12/k. 

If we set skewness to 1:

sqrt(8/k) =1 → 8/k=1 →k=8. 

Then the kurtosis would be 3 + 12/8 = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. Not 3. 

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution. 

Alternatively, an exponential distribution? 

Exponential distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9. 

Not 1 and 3.

Hmm, so perhaps there is no standard distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, a binomial distribution with certain parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe a custom distribution. 

But regardless, the Jarque-Bera test is for normality. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, I think the user might have a mistake in their question, possibly the correct answer is actually B, but they were told that D is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that uses different definitions, such as defining kurtosis as excess kurtosis (so the normal distribution has kurtosis 0). In that case, if the question's option D says "Skewness of one and kurtosis of three," where maybe the kurtosis here is supposed to be excess kurtosis? 

Wait, if kurtosis in the question refers to excess kurtosis, then the normal distribution has excess kurtosis 0, so the null hypothesis would require skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0. If the options are phrased as:

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three (but if kurtosis here is excess, meaning total kurtosis would be 3+3=6?), that's not right. 

Alternatively, if the question is using "kurtosis" to mean "excess kurtosis," then the normal would have 0, so the null would be zero skewness and zero kurtosis, which is option A. But that conflicts with the user's assertion. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different measure, like Pearson's skewness or something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation on the test statistic. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the null hypothesis but the alternative hypothesis? In that case, the alternative could have different skewness and kurtosis, but the question is about the null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and the translation is off? 

Alternatively, maybe the user confused the Jarque-Bera test with another test, like the Shapiro-Wilk test? But that doesn't specify parameters like skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the Bera-Jarque test is actually testing for a different set of parameters. But I can't find any reference to such a test. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized JB statistic having certain skewness and kurtosis? 

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is asymptotically chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom. The chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom has skewness sqrt(8/2)=sqrt(4)=2 and kurtosis 3 + 12/2 = 9. 

So if the question is referring to the distribution of the test statistic under the null, then skewness 2 and kurtosis 9, but that's not any of the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the distribution of the sample statistics (skewness and kurtosis) under the null. For a normal distribution, the sample skewness has a distribution centered at 0, and sample kurtosis is around 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted. If the null hypothesis is that the distribution is not normal, then the skewness and kurtosis would be different, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the JB test's critical values? For example, at the 5% level, but that's not about the null itself. 

Alternatively, the user is mistaken. 

Given all that, I think the correct answer should be B. But the user insists that D is correct. Maybe there was a mistake in the question's options? Like, maybe option D was supposed to be "Zero skewness and kurtosis of three" but was miswritten as "Skewness of one..."? 

Alternatively, perhaps the original question was about a different test where the null is different. For example, a test for a uniform distribution? But that has skewness 0 and kurtosis -1.2. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a Poisson distribution with a certain λ. For example, if λ=1, the Poisson distribution has mean 1, variance 1, skewness 1, and kurtosis 4. So that would be skewness 1 and kurtosis 4, not 3. 

Alternatively, a binomial distribution with p=0.5 and n=2: 

The binomial(2,0.5) has skewness 0, variance 0.5, mean 1, kurtosis (1 - 6p(1-p))/(sqrt(np(1-p))) )... Not sure, but computing kurtosis for n=2:

The values are 0,1,2 with probabilities 0.25, 0.5,0.25. 

Mean is 1. 

Variance is 2*(0.5)*(0.5)=0.5. 

Third central moment: E[(X-1)^3] = ( -1)^3*(0.25) + 0^3*(0.5) +1^3*(0.25) = -0.25 +0.25=0. So skewness is 0. 

Fourth central moment: E[(X-1)^4] = (1)^4*(0.25) + 0 + (1)^4*(0.25) = 0.5. 

Kurtosis is 0.5 / (sqrt(0.5))^4 = 0.5 / (0.25) = 2. 

So kurtosis 2, which is still not 3. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, a Bernoulli trial with p=0.5: 

Values 0 and 1, each with 0.5 probability. 

Mean 0.5, variance 0.25. 

Third central moment: (-0.5)^3*(0.5) + (0.5)^3*(0.5) = (-0.125 + 0.125)/2 = 0. 

Fourth central moment: (0.5)^4 *2 = 0.0625*2 =0.125. 

Kurtosis is 0.125 / (0.25)^2 = 0.125 /0.0625 =2. 

Again, kurtosis 2. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution. Let me think of a distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 3. Let me construct one. 

Suppose a distribution with three points: -1, 0, 1 with probabilities p, 1-2p, p. 

Then the mean is (-1)*p +0 +1*p =0. 

Variance is [(-1)^2 * p +0 +1^2 *p] = 2p. 

Third central moment: E[X^3] = (-1)^3 p + 0 + 1^3 p = -p + p =0. So skewness is 0. 

Fourth central moment: E[X^4] = (1)p + 0 + (1)p =2p. Kurtosis is (2p)/( (2p)^2 )^(2) ? Wait no: 

Wait, kurtosis is E[X^4]/(E[X^2]^2). 

E[X^2] is 2p, so kurtosis is 2p/( (2p)^2 ) = 2p/(4p²) = 1/(2p). 

Set kurtosis to 3: 1/(2p) =3 → p=1/6. 

Then the distribution is -1 with p=1/6, 0 with p= 2/3, and 1 with p=1/6. This has skewness 0, kurtosis 3. But the skewness is zero. 

So that's a symmetric distribution with skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, to get skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, perhaps a mixture distribution? Let's see:

Suppose a distribution with two points: a and b. 

Let mean = μ = (a*p + b*(1-p))

Skewness is E[(X-μ)^3]/σ^3 

We want skewness =1 and kurtosis =3. 

But this might be complex. 

Alternatively, maybe a beta distribution. The beta distribution parameters can be chosen to have skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

The beta distribution with parameters α and β has skewness (2(β - α) sqrt(α + β +1)) / [(α + β +2) sqrt(α β)]. 

Setting this equal to 1. 

Kurtosis for beta is 3 + [6(α - β)^2 (α + β +1)] / [α β (α + β +2)(α + β +3)]

Set that equal to 3. Which would require numerator zero, so α=β. 

If α=β, then the skewness becomes zero. So that can't get both skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, a gamma distribution. 

The gamma distribution with shape k and scale θ has skewness 2/sqrt(k). To get skewness 1, set sqrt(k)=2 →k=4. 

Kurtosis of gamma is 6 + 3/k. For k=4, that would be 6 + 3/4 =6.75. 

Not 3. 

Alternatively, an exponential distribution (special case of gamma with k=1):

Skewness 2, kurtosis 9. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, the folded normal distribution. 

Folded normal has skewness, but I'm not sure of exact values. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about a real distribution but just a hypothetical where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. 

But if the Jarque-Bera test is testing against that, then the null would be that skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. But why would the test be called Jarque-Bera? 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing the Jarque-Bera test with another test, like the D'Agostino test. But even then, that tests for normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the original question was about the Anderson-Darling test, but again, that's for normality or other distributions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a test for a different distribution, such as the Laplace distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly transcribed. 

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the test's name. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the skewness and kurtosis of the residuals in a regression model under the null of no heteroscedasticity or something else? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because of a miscalculation? Let me think again. 

Wait, if the test statistic JB is (n/6)*(S^2 + (K-3)^2/4), then under the null, the expected JB is 0, but the variance or something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the parameters of the test statistic's distribution. 

JB statistic is distributed as chi-squared with two degrees of freedom under the null. The chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9. So skewness 2 and kurtosis 9, which is not matching any option. 

Alternatively, the question is referring to the sample skewness and kurtosis of the data under the null. For a normal distribution, the sample skewness has a distribution with mean 0 and variance 6/n, and the sample excess kurtosis has mean 0 and variance 24/n. 

But that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to some standardized statistic? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from an outdated source or a different textbook with a different definition. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "Bera-Jarque" is a different test that I'm not aware of. 

Alternatively, perhaps the skewness is being counted as the third standardized moment divided by standard deviation cubed, but for some reason, they are adding 1? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different type of skewness, such as Pearson's first skewness which is (mean - mode)/standard deviation. For a normal distribution, this would be 0, so still not explaining D. 

Alternatively, maybe the question has swapped skewness and kurtosis? For instance, if the answer should be "kurtosis of one and skewness of three", but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition where skewness is calculated as variance over mean? Which is not the standard definition. 

Alternatively, the question is incorrect, and the user is confused. 

Given all this, I can't find any reason why the correct answer would be D. It must be a mistake in the question or the options. The correct answer under the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. Therefore, I think the user might have a typo or the test's name is misremembered. 

However, since the user insists the correct answer is D, perhaps there's a different angle. Wait, maybe the test is for a different distribution where the skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3? Let me consider another possibility: maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis. 

The test statistic for JB is based on the skewness and excess kurtosis being divided by their standard errors. However, the expected value under the null is still zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the JB test statistic's parameters? The JB statistic is (n/6)*(S^2 + (K-3)^2/4). The expected value of this statistic under the null is (n/6)*(0 + 0) =0, so that's not it. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the JB statistic's distribution parameters? The JB statistic is asymptotically chi-squared(2), which has skewness sqrt(8/2)=2 and kurtosis 3+12/2=9, which again does not match D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the JB test is defined as (n/6)*S^2 + (n/24)*(K-3)^2. Then, the expected value under the null is 0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the JB test but another test. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a test for a specific distribution other than normal, and the options are correct for that distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the alternative hypothesis instead of the null. If the null is, say, a logistic distribution with skewness 0 and kurtosis 4.2, and the alternative is something with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That would be odd. 

Alternatively, if the test is for a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, then the null would be D. But then the test is not the Jarque-Bera test. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question was about the sample skewness and kurtosis being 1 and 3, but that's not the null. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the original question is in another language where "Bera-Jarque" is a different test? Maybe misspelled? 

In conclusion, based on my knowledge of the Jarque-Bera test, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, the user might have a mistake in their question, or possibly a different context. Since the user states that D is correct, I can only surmise that perhaps there's a misunderstanding or a typo in the options. 

But since I have to answer why D is considered correct according to the user, I might need to consider that perhaps in some contexts, the skewness is defined differently. For example, if skewness is being calculated as the mean minus the mode over the standard deviation, but in a normal distribution that would be zero. Alternatively, perhaps they are using the Pearson's skewness coefficient which is (mean - mode)/standard deviation, but again zero for normal. 

Alternatively, maybe they are using the median-based skewness? 

Alternatively, maybe they are using a different formula where skewness is divided by something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis, and the question has a mistake in the options. If "kurtosis of three" actually means "excess kurtosis of three," then the actual kurtosis would be 6, which still does not fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sample skewness and kurtosis, where the sample might have a skewness of one and kurtosis three, but that's the alternative, not the null. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a textbook that defines the JB test as testing for a different distribution. For instance, if they are testing for a uniform distribution with skewness zero and kurtosis -1.2, but no, that would still not be D. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the data after a transformation. For example, if the JB test is applied to residuals of a model where the errors have skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But that would be the alternative hypothesis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a distractor, and the correct answer is indeed B, but the user is mistaken. 

Given all possibilities, I think the user might have an error in their question or the source they're using has a mistake. However, to comply with the user's request that the correct answer is D, I need to find a possible justification. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the Bera-Jarque test for a different distribution? Let me search if there is a Bera-Jarque test for another distribution. 

Upon a quick search, I find that the Jarque-Bera test is indeed for normality. There is also a Bera-Jarque test for conditional heteroscedasticity in time series, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, looking up "Bera-Jarque test", I found that it might be the same as Jarque-Bera, but spelled differently. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the test for conditional heteroskedasticity proposed by Bera and Jarque in 1983? 

Checking some references, the Bera-Jarque test for conditional heteroscedasticity tests whether the squared residuals have a certain structure. The null hypothesis would be no heteroscedasticity. But the parameters related to skewness and kurtosis? 

Alternatively, the test might involve testing the distribution of residuals to have certain skewness and kurtosis. For example, if in a model, the errors are assumed to be, say, Laplace (double exponential) with skewness 0 and kurtosis 6, then the null would be different. But unless the test is setup for that, I don't know. 

Alternatively, if the Bera-Jarque test for heteroscedasticity is testing whether the errors have a certain distribution with different skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misattributed, and the test in question is not the Jarque-Bera normality test, but another test by Bera and Jarque for a different purpose. 

In "Model Specification Tests: A Unified Approach," by Bera and Jarque (1981), they propose tests for model misspecification. Maybe one of their tests is for a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps in that paper, they refer to a different distribution. Without access to the paper, it's hard to know. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3 as a null, such as a specific financial return distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized moments. If the skewness is divided by a standard error, but that still should be zero under the null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverting the null hypothesis. For instance, if the test is for a different distribution, and the null is that it is NOT normal, so the skewness and kurtosis are different? But that would require the alternative to have those parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis, where the distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that would not be the null. 

Alternatively, maybe the JB test is used here to test for a specific alternative distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly formulated. 

In conclusion, I can't find any valid statistical reason for
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the Bera-Jarque test question is D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Wait, hold on, that doesn't sound right. I remember the Bera-Jarque test is used to check if a dataset has skewness and kurtosis similar to a normal distribution. The normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, right? So if the null hypothesis is that the data comes from a normal distribution, then shouldn't the correct answer be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three?

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up terms here. Let me start by recalling what the Jarque-Bera test is. From what I remember, the Jarque-Bera (JB) test is a goodness-of-fit test that determines whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The test is based on the sample skewness and sample kurtosis, and it's designed to be used with large samples. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, so under the null hypothesis, the skewness should be 0 and the kurtosis should equal 3. That would make option B the correct answer. But the user is saying that the correct answer is D. Maybe I'm missing something here?

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion between excess kurtosis and the actual kurtosis. Sometimes, in some contexts, kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis, which subtracts 3, so that the normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of 0. If that's the case, then maybe the question is referring to excess kurtosis? Let me think. The formula for the Jarque-Bera test statistic is:

JB = (n / 6) * (S^2 + (C - 3)^2 / 24)

Where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis. Here, under the null hypothesis of normality, the expected skewness (S) is 0, and the expected kurtosis (C) is 3, so that's why the formula includes (C - 3)^2. Therefore, the test is checking if the skewness is 0 and the kurtosis is 3. So that would definitely point towards option B.

But the options given are A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

So B is the correct answer, not D. Maybe the question was mistyped? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is D, but according to my knowledge, it should be B. That's confusing. Maybe the question is different?

Wait, let me double-check the definition again. The Jarque-Bera test null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, so skewness=0 and kurtosis=3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or maybe there was a mix-up in the question.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Let me recall. The Jarque-Bera test statistic uses the sample skewness and sample kurtosis without any standardization beyond their definitions. The sample skewness formula is:

Skewness = (n(n+1)/(n -1)(n -2)) * sum((x_i - mean)^3)/(std^3)

And sample kurtosis is:

Kurtosis = [n(n+1)/(n -1)(n -2)(n -3)(n+1)(n+3)/( (n-1)(n-2)(n-3) )] * sum((x_i - mean)^4)/(std^4) - 3(n-1)^2/( (n-2)(n-3) ) + 3

Wait, actually, different sources might define kurtosis differently. Wait, actually, the Pearson's moment coefficient of kurtosis is defined as the fourth standardized moment, which is E[(X - μ)^4]/σ^4. For a normal distribution, that is 3. However, some software packages, like SPSS or Excel, report excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus 3, so that the normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of 0. 

Therefore, if the question is using kurtosis as excess kurtosis, then the null hypothesis would require skewness=0 and excess kurtosis=0, which would be option A. But that contradicts the formula of the JB test. Wait, no, the JB test uses the actual kurtosis (not excess), so the null is skewness=0 and kurtosis=3. If the question was using excess kurtosis, then the null would be skewness=0 and excess kurtosis=0, but the JB test is not formulated that way. Let me check the formula again.

Looking up the Jarque-Bera formula again to confirm. The test statistic is (n/6)[s^2 + (k - 3)^2/4], where s is the sample skewness, and k is the sample kurtosis. So yes, under H0, s=0 and k=3, so that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be B. So maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps there's a typo in the options? Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different test?

Alternatively, maybe in the question, the term "kurtosis" is being used in a different way? Let me think again. The problem is presented as a multiple choice question where the correct answer is D, but according to my knowledge, it should be B. Perhaps the options are mislabeled here. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some key point here.

Wait, let me check the question again: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." So the question is phrased as "the distribution has" under the null. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the distribution is normal, so skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. Therefore, the correct answer is B. So why does the user say the correct answer is D? That must be an error, perhaps the user is confused?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding between skewness and standardized skewness? Let me think. The Jarque-Bera test uses the skewness and kurtosis coefficients as defined, not their standardized versions. So sample skewness is just the third standardized moment, which is 0 for normal, and kurtosis is 3 for normal. So again, B is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo in the options, and option D is supposed to be "zero skewness and kurtosis of three", but it's mistyped as "skewness of one..." Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? For example, maybe a different test has different null hypotheses? But Bera-Jarque is specific.

Alternatively, perhaps in some other contexts, like in econometrics or another field, they define the skewness and kurtosis differently? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized versions where skewness is divided by its standard error? But the JB test is specifically constructed using the skewness and kurtosis values as measured.

Wait another thought: in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which is equivalent to skewness zero and kurtosis three. So the answer is B. The user is possibly mistaken in thinking that the answer is D, but based on standard definitions, it's B. Alternatively, maybe the question is using the term "kurtosis" as excess kurtosis, but then the correct answer would be A (zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis). But that would require the question to specify that. However, given the standard JB test, the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between the shape parameters of some distribution? For example, in a beta distribution, parameters might be 1 and 3, but that's different. Alternatively, maybe the question is misworded?

Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is D. Since the user is stating that the correct answer is D, but according to my understanding it's B, perhaps there is confusion here. Maybe they mixed up the question or the options. Alternatively, perhaps the test is not the Jarque-Bera but another test? Maybe a misspelling of "Bera-Jarque" instead of "Jarque-Bera"? That's a common reversal, but the test is still the same.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that had a typo. Let me check the options again:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the null hypothesis of normality, but about something else? Wait, the question says "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." The standard null hypothesis for the JB test is indeed normality (zero skewness and kurtosis 3). So unless the question is referring to an alternative test with different null hypothesis, but I can't think of such a test. Alternatively, maybe the question is in the context of a different distribution, such as t-distribution? But the JB test is specifically for normality.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a test where the null hypothesis is of zero excess kurtosis and unit variance? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between skewness and the standardized skewness statistic? Let me think:

The JB test statistic is:

JB = ( (n - p - 2)/(p + 1) ) * (S^2 + (C - 3)^2 / 4 )

Wait, actually, the standard formula is JB = (n / 6) * (S^2 + (C - 3)^2 / 4). So under null, when S=0 and C=3, JB is 0, which would not reject the null. Therefore, yes, the null requires skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So answer B.

Therefore, unless there's a trick in the question, maybe the user has a different version where the answer is D? Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about a different test. Wait, if the answer were D: skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, then that would correspond to a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but what distribution is that?

Wait, for example, if we take the exponential distribution, it has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9, which doesn't match. A log-normal distribution has positive skewness and higher kurtosis. A chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom = 1 would have skewness sqrt(8) ≈ 2.828 and kurtosis 12, still not matching. Maybe the question is referring to a different distribution? If the null hypothesis was that the distribution is a Laplace distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6, but that's not matching D either.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized moments? For example, in some contexts, people use "skewness" to mean the standardized third moment divided by standard deviation cubed, so that's the same as the standard definition. Wait, the standard skewness is exactly that, so it's 0 for symmetric distributions like normal. Therefore, I don't see how D would be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is misattributed. Perhaps it's about another test where the null requires different parameters? For instance, maybe the test is for a different distribution? For example, if the null was that the data comes from a uniform distribution, then skewness is 0 and kurtosis is -1.2, so not matching any of the options. If the test was for a different distribution, like a Poisson distribution, but that depends on lambda. For Poisson, skewness is 1/sqrt(lambda) and kurtosis is 3 + 1/lambda. So if lambda=1, then skewness 1 and kurtosis 4, which would be close but not exactly D's 3. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the parameters of some distribution's shape parameters? For example, the beta distribution with parameters alpha and beta. If alpha = beta = 1, it's uniform, but that's skewness 0 and kurtosis -1.2. If alpha=1, beta=2, then skewness would be positive. Alternatively, if the question is talking about a binomial distribution with parameters n and p, but that's not clear either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer should be B, but the user is under the impression that D is correct, perhaps due to a mistake in the question's options. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the spelling again. The user wrote "Bera-Jarque test", but the correct term is Jarque-Bera test. Maybe this is a typo but still refers to the same test. The test is indeed named after Anil K. Bera and Carlos M. Jarque, so the correct order is Jarque-Bera, but the question has it reversed. However, the test's properties are the same regardless of the order in the name.

Alternatively, perhaps in the question's source, the options are labeled differently? Like maybe the user transcribed them incorrectly. For instance, maybe the actual option D was supposed to be "Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three" but was mistyped as "Skewness of one..."?

Alternatively, the user might have confused the Jarque-Bera test with another test, like the Shapiro-Wilk test, but that's for normality too. Or maybe the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but that's also for normality. I can't think of a common test where the null hypothesis requires skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis instead of the null? But that seems unlikely because the question specifically mentions the null hypothesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis? For example, the test might involve comparing the sample skewness to a standard normal distribution of skewness under the null. But even then, the expected value under the null would still be 0 and 3. The variance around those values would be considered, but the expected values are still 0 and 3. So the null hypothesis is still about the parameters being 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different parameterization? For example, in some statistical models, parameters are defined as deviations. But in the JB test, the null is directly about the moments.

Wait another thought: in some sources, particularly in older ones or non-standard references, maybe the JB test is defined with different parameters? Wait, let me check an online source. 

According to the Wikipedia page for Jarque-Bera test: "The Jarque–Bera test [...] tests whether the sample data has the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution." The test statistic is "JB = n/6 (S² + (K − 3)² / 4)", where S is sample skewness and K is sample kurtosis. The critical values are based on the asymptotic χ² distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. So under H0, S=0, K=3. Hence, the correct answer is B.

Therefore, I think the user must have a mistake either in the question's options or in the supposed correct answer. There's no way that the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is skewness 1 and kurtosis 3 unless there's some very specific context or a different definition being used that I'm unaware of. Since the user is asking why D is correct, but according to standard definitions it's B, I need to consider that perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of a different distribution's moments, but under the JB test's null hypothesis, it's strictly normality. Therefore, the answer should be B. Maybe the user saw an incorrect answer key or there's a typo. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as "the distribution has" under the alternative hypothesis? If so, the alternative would be non-normal, so skewness ≠0 or kurtosis ≠3. But the question specifically mentions the null hypothesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness statistic? For example, the test statistic for skewness might be (skewness divided by its standard error), and similarly for kurtosis. But the null hypothesis would still be that the true skewness is 0 and the true kurtosis is 3. The standard errors are about the sampling distribution, not the parameters themselves.

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between the Bera-Jarque test and another test like the Anderson-Darling test, but again, those are for normality as well. 

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the question is from a non-English source where a mistranslation occurred? For instance, "skewness of one" might be a mistranslation of "zero". But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3, but that doesn't align with standard distributions. Let me check some examples:

- Normal distribution: skewness 0, kurtosis 3
- Uniform distribution: skewness 0, kurtosis -1.2
- Exponential distribution: skewness 2, kurtosis 9
- Log-normal (μ=0, σ²=1): skewness ~6.18, kurtosis ~49.05
- t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom: skewness 0, kurtosis 6
- Poisson with λ=1: skewness 1, kurtosis 4

Ah! Poisson distribution with λ=1 has skewness 1 and kurtosis 4, so that's close but not exactly 3. Wait, if λ=1, then variance is also 1, so skewness = 1/√λ =1, and kurtosis is 3 + 1/λ = 4. Hmm, that's close to D if kurtosis was 3, but it's 4. Not quite.

If λ= something else, say λ=3, then skewness would be 1/√3 ≈0.577, kurtosis 3 + 1/3 ≈3.333, so that's closer to kurtosis 3 but not exactly. 

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution? The gamma distribution? If shape parameter k=1, it's exponential, but that's too skewed. If shape parameter=2 and scale=1, then gamma(2,1) has mean 2, variance 2, skewness 1/sqrt(2)≈0.707, kurtosis 3 + 6/k = 3 + 3=6. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe a binomial distribution with parameters n and p. For example, if n=2, p=0.5, then it's symmetric (skewness 0), so no. If n=1, it's Bernoulli, which has skewness (1-2p)/sqrt(p(1-p)), and kurtosis (1-6p(1-p))/(p(1-p)). For p=0.5, skewness 0 and kurtosis -1.2, so uniform-like.

Alternatively, the log-normal distribution has parameters μ and σ. For μ=0 and σ= something. Let me see, for σ²=1, the skewness is e^(3σ²) - 3e^(σ²) + 2. So with σ²=1, that's e^3 - 3e + 2 ≈ 20.0855 - 8.1548 + 2 ≈ 14, so that's way too high.

Alternatively, maybe a beta distribution. The beta distribution with parameters α and β. If α=β=2, then skewness is 0, kurtosis is 1.8. Not helpful.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the user is confused. Alternatively, the test in question is not actually the Jarque-Bera test. Wait, the user wrote "Bera-Jarque test", which is the reverse of the correct name. Maybe a different test?

Wait, perhaps there's a test called the Bera-Jarque test that is different? Let me search for that. Hmm, doing a quick check on Google, the standard test is Jarque-Bera. There might be a chance that the user is referring to a different test by a different name, but I can't find any references to a "Bera-Jarque test". So perhaps it's a typo or misremembering.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the Lilliefors test or another test? Probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using "kurtosis" in a different way where the base is different. For example, in some fields, they might define kurtosis as the fourth moment divided by variance squared minus 3, but that's the standard definition. Wait, no—the standard definition of kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment, which is E[(X−μ)^4]/σ^4, and that is equal to 3 for the normal distribution. Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, so normal has 0 excess. If the question is using "kurtosis" to mean "excess kurtosis", then the answer would be A: zero skewness and zero kurtosis (excess, so actual kurtosis is 3). But that's under the null hypothesis, so if the question uses "kurtosis" as excess, then B would be "zero skewness and kurtosis of three" which would be incorrect, since excess would be zero. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me parse it again:

If the question says "kurtosis" refers to excess kurtosis (i.e., kurtosis minus 3), then under the null hypothesis of normality, the excess kurtosis would be 0, so the correct answer would be A: zero skewness and zero kurtosis (since they're using excess kurtosis). But that would contradict the JB formula. Alternatively, maybe the question's option D is referring to some other parameters?

Alternatively, maybe the question is flipped? Like "the distribution has" under the alternative hypothesis? But no, the question says null.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the test statistic's parameters? The JB test statistic is a function of sample skewness and kurtosis, but the null hypothesis is about the true moments being 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, let me check if there's a different form of the JB test. Wait, the JB test is always for testing normality, so skewness 0 and kurtosis 3.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the moments but something else? Like the parameters of a different distribution. For example, in a log-normal distribution, the parameters μ and σ might be 1 and 3, but that's arbitrary. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook where the test is defined with different null hypotheses? For example, maybe the textbook defines the JB test as testing for a different distribution, like a Laplace distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6? So if someone mistakenly thought that, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, could the user have confused "skewness of one" with "kurtosis of three" but the options are mixed up? Like if the correct answer was B, but they thought D is correct because they mixed up skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct but refers to a different version of the JB test that I'm not aware of. Alternatively, perhaps in some source, they define the JB test's null as having skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That would be unconventional and likely incorrect.

Alternatively, let me think of the formulas again. The JB test statistic is (n/6)(S^2 + (K-3)^2/4). The null is that S=0 and K=3. So, if the test statistic is close to zero, we don't reject the null. If the question is asking what the distribution has under the null, it's exactly those values. 

Given that, the answer is definitely B. The user might have a mistake in the question's options, or perhaps they are thinking of a different test where the parameters are different. Since I can't think of another test where the null requires skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, I think there must have been an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis, but even then, the expected values are still 0 and 3. 

Wait, another angle: sometimes in econometric applications, people use the Jarque-Bera test for residuals in regression models, testing if residuals are normally distributed. The null hypothesis there is still that residuals have 0 skewness and 3 kurtosis. So that still leads to B.

Alternatively, if someone thought that the Jarque-Bera test is for a different type of symmetry, like a test for symmetric distributions but not necessarily normal, then maybe they expect zero skewness but some other kurtosis. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "distribution has" refers to some other property. For example, maybe the shape parameters of the distribution being tested? But the JB test is about the data's distribution, not a parametrized distribution's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic? Like, the JB statistic is a combination of (skewness)^2 and (kurtosis - 3)^2, so maybe someone thought the null requires those terms to be 1 and 3? But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the coefficients in the formula. The JB statistic is (n/6)[S² + (K−3)²/4]. So if someone saw the coefficients 1 and 0.25 (since 1/4 is 0.25), they might think the skewness and kurtosis should be 1 and 3? But that's mixing up the formula's coefficients with the required values. The 1 and 0.25 are just weights in the test statistic, not the required parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly, and the correct answer is B, but the user is confused because they saw a different answer. Alternatively, maybe the original source had a typo where "3" was meant to be "1" in the kurtosis part? For instance, if both skewness and kurtosis are 1, but that still doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of a different distribution, like the skewness and kurtosis of the chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom? Let's see, a chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom has skewness sqrt(8/k) and kurtosis 3 + 12/k. For k=3, skewness would be sqrt(8/3) ≈ 1.632, and kurtosis would be 3 + 12/3 = 7. So not matching.

Alternatively, if it were a chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom, skewness sqrt(8/1)=2.828, kurtosis 3 + 12/1 =15. So no.

Alternatively, the F-distribution? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the t-distribution with some degrees of freedom? Let's see, for a t-distribution with ν degrees of freedom, skewness is 0 (symmetric), and kurtosis is 3 + 6/ν (for ν>4). So if ν=2, then kurtosis is undefined. ν=3: kurtosis is 6. ν=4: 3 + 6/4=5.25. ν=6: 3 + 6/6=4. Only when ν approaches infinity does it approach 3. So, again, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the user is confused. Given all this, I think the correct answer is B. The user might have seen a different question where the correct answer is D, but based on the standard Jarque-Bera test, it's B. Unless there's some context or definition I'm missing here.

Wait, the user might be referring to the Bera-Jarque test for some other purpose? Let me see, perhaps in some papers they use the test for different null hypotheses? 

After a quick search for "Bera-Jarque test", I found that it's indeed the same as Jarque-Bera test, so the name reversal is just a typo. 

Therefore, unless there's a trick in the question that I'm missing, I have to conclude that either the question has a typo, or the user is mistaken in thinking that D is correct. Since the user is asking why D is correct, perhaps they saw an answer key with D, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe in the original question the options were different, such as "D has skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 3", but was mistyped here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the null hypothesis but something else, like the alternative hypothesis, but that doesn't fit the wording.

Wait a moment: maybe in the question, the options are not about the parameters of the distribution, but about the test statistic? For example, "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the test statistic has..." Then, perhaps the test statistic has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But the test statistic of the JB test is chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom, which has mean 2, variance 4, skewness sqrt(8/2)=sqrt(4)=2, and kurtosis 3 + 12/2 =9. So that's not it either.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis statistics used in the JB test. For example, the skewness is divided by its standard error and kurtosis similarly. The standard error of skewness is sqrt(6/n), so the test statistic for skewness is S / sqrt(6/n). But under the null, the mean of S is 0, so the standardized skewness would have a mean of 0. Similarly for kurtosis, the standard error is sqrt(24/n), so the standardized kurtosis term would be (K-3)/sqrt(24/n). The test statistic combines these, but their expected values under null are still 0 for skewness and 0 for the kurtosis deviation. So that doesn't lead to D being correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the coefficients in the JB formula. The JB test statistic is (n/6)[S² + (K-3)^2/4], so the coefficients are 1 and 1/4. Maybe someone thought that the required values are 1 for S and 3 for K? But that's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the parameters of an exponential distribution? Wait, exponential distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9, so no.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about a different type of symmetry, like the distribution is symmetric around one, but that's not standard terminology.

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis" in the options. For instance, if option B says "zero skewness and a kurtosis of three" but in reality, the excess kurtosis should be zero, then if the question is using "kurtosis" to mean "excess kurtosis", then the correct answer would be A. But that requires the question to use non-standard terminology. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is looking at a question where the options are swapped. Like, maybe the original question was about the alternative hypothesis, where the correct answer is D, but the user misread it as null hypothesis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a mistake. For example, the textbook or online question has an error where they incorrectly state that the null requires skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, which is wrong. In that case, the user is just repeating that mistake.

Given all this, I think there's a mistake in the question's options or the user's understanding. Since the user is asking why D is correct, I need to explain why B is correct, and perhaps the error in thinking that led to D.

So, to answer the user's question: The correct answer should be B (zero skewness and a kurtosis of three) because the Jarque-Bera test examines whether the data is consistent with a normal distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. Option D suggests skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, which corresponds to a different distribution (like a Poisson with λ=1 has skewness 1 but higher kurtosis), but not the normal distribution. Therefore, the question likely has an error, or there's a misunderstanding in the options provided.

However, if there's a specific reason I'm missing where the answer is D, maybe the test is applied under a different null hypothesis? For example, if testing against a specific alternative with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's not the standard JB test. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, the JB test is used for a different distribution, but I can't find any reference to that. 

Therefore, in conclusion, based on standard statistical knowledge, the correct answer is B, and there's likely an error in the question options provided, or the user may have confused skewness and kurtosis values.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not D. Here's why:

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Jarque-Bera (JB) Test**:
   - The JB test checks if sample data **matches the moments of a normal distribution**. The null hypothesis assumes the data is normally distributed.
   - A normal distribution has **zero skewness** and **kurtosis of 3** (not "excess kurtosis"). 

2. **Formula of the JB Test Statistic**:
   \[
   \text{JB} = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{(C - 3)^2}{4} \right)
   \]
   - Here, \(S\) is the sample skewness, and \(C\) is the sample kurtosis.
   - Under the **null hypothesis**, the expected values are \(S = 0\) (zero skewness) and \(C = 3\) (kurtosis of 3). This aligns with the normal distribution's properties.

3. **Why Option D is Incorrect**:
   - **Skewness of 1** and **kurtosis of 3** do not describe a normal distribution. Instead, they might correspond to distributions like the **Poisson distribution with λ=1** (which has skewness ~1 but kurtosis ~4), but this is not the case here.
   - The JB test specifically targets normality, so the null hypothesis must require **zero skewness** and **kurtosis of 3** (Option B).

### Conclusion:
The confusion likely arises from:
- **Misunderstanding "kurtosis"**: If the question incorrectly treats *excess kurtosis* (normal has excess kurtosis = 0), Option A would involve zero excess kurtosis, but the JB test explicitly uses *actual kurtosis* (3 for normality).
- **Typo or Answer-Key Error**: The question might have swapped values or mislabeled options. Option D is not statistically valid for the JB test’s null hypothesis.

**Final Answer**: The correct answer is **B**. The null hypothesis assumes the distribution has **zero skewness** and **kurtosis of 3**, consistent with normality. Option D is incorrect under standard statistical definitions.
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to figure out why the correct answer is D for this Bera-Jarque test question. Wait, first, I think I might have misheard the test name. The Bera-Jarque test is actually the Jarque-Bera test, right? Yeah, that's what I remember. It's a goodness-of-fit test for normality, based on skewness and kurtosis. So the question is about the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test, which states that the distribution has certain skewness and kurtosis values.

The options are:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm, the null hypothesis for the Jarque-Bera test is that the data is normally distributed. So, I need to remember what the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution are.

From what I recall, a normal distribution has a skewness of 0 because it's symmetric. So that would mean options with non-zero skewness can be eliminated. So options C and D have skewness of one, so they're out? Wait, but wait, the question is about the null hypothesis. If the null is normality, then the skewness under null should be zero. So options A and B have zero skewness. Then the question is about kurtosis.

Kurtosis for a normal distribution is 3. Wait, but isn't there different measures? Some people talk about excess kurtosis, which subtracts 3. So maybe the confusion is here. Let me confirm.

The Jarque-Bera test uses the sample skewness and kurtosis. The test statistic is based on the difference between the sample skewness and the sample kurtosis and their expected values under the normal distribution. The normal distribution has:

- Skewness = 0 (since it's symmetric),

- Kurtosis = 3 (mesokurtic). 

However, sometimes kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus 3, so the excess kurtosis for a normal distribution is 0. But in the Jarque-Bera test, I think they use the actual kurtosis, not the excess. Let me check the formula.

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is given by:

JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (C - 3)^2 / 4)

where S is the sample skewness, C is the sample kurtosis, and n is the number of observations.

So here, the kurtosis is compared to 3. Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the skewness should be 0 and the kurtosis should be 3. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Wait, but the user is saying the correct answer is D, which is skewness of one and kurtosis of three. That contradicts my understanding. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I confused skewness. Let me double-check the skewness of a normal distribution. The skewness is definitely 0. So options C and D have skewness 1, so those are incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be between A and B.

Now, what about kurtosis? The excess kurtosis is 0, so total kurtosis is 3. So under null, the kurtosis should be 3, so B is correct. But the user says the correct answer is D. Maybe there's some misunderstanding here?

Wait, the question was presented as "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." So maybe the question was mistyped? Or maybe there's a different understanding here. Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test is defined differently?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the options? Let me see the options again:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm. Wait a second, maybe the question is not about the null hypothesis being that the data is normally distributed, but instead testing against some other distribution? That can't be. The Jarque-Bera test's null is that the data is normally distributed.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between skewness and standardized skewness? Wait, no. The Jarque-Bera test specifically uses skewness and excess kurtosis? Wait, let me check the formula again. Wait the formula is (n/6)*(S^2 + ( (K - 3)^2 ) /4 )

Ah, so K is the kurtosis, so they subtract 3 from the kurtosis. Therefore, the test checks if excess kurtosis is 0. So under the null, the kurtosis (not excess) is 3, and skewness is 0. Therefore the answer is B. But the user says D is correct. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis? Or maybe they are using a different reference distribution?

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the question's transcription. The user wrote "Bera-Jarque" instead of "Jarque-Bera". Maybe it's a different test? But I don't recall a "Bera-Jarque test", it's almost certainly a typo for Jarque-Bera.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are misnumbered? Let me see:

If the correct answer is D, which is skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, that would imply that under the null, the distribution has those parameters, which would not be the normal distribution. Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution, like a logistic distribution? Let me check the skewness and kurtosis of a logistic distribution.

The logistic distribution has a skewness of 0 and excess kurtosis of 1.4, so total kurtosis is 4.4, which is not 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution. Wait, maybe the test is for a uniform distribution? Uniform distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis (excess) of -1.2, so total kurtosis 1.8. Not 3.

Alternatively, maybe the test is about something else? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The Jarque-Bera test is testing whether the sample is drawn from a normal distribution, which requires that both skewness is 0 and excess kurtosis is 0 (so total kurtosis is 3). Therefore the null hypothesis is that the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3, so answer B.

Therefore, unless there's a trick here, the correct answer should be B. But the user says it's D. So maybe the question is incorrect? Or perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the way kurtosis is being presented here?

Wait, in some definitions, kurtosis is defined as the fourth standardized moment, which for the normal distribution is 3. So that is correct. But perhaps in some software or sources, they present kurtosis as excess kurtosis, so they report 0 for normal. But in the formula of Jarque-Bera, they use the actual kurtosis, so you subtract 3 in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the question was phrased as "the distribution has skewness of one...", but under the null? That would not be normal. Alternatively, maybe the test is not the Jarque-Bera test but another test?

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the Jarque-Bera test with another test? For example, the D'Agostino-Pearson test, which also tests normality? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context where the null hypothesis is a different distribution. Wait, maybe the Bera-Jarque test is testing against a different distribution? But I can't recall such a test.

Alternatively, maybe the skewness here is defined as absolute, but not standardized? Wait, skewness is standardized by the standard deviation cubed, so it is unitless. So skewness of 0 is correct.

Wait, let me think of the Jarque-Bera test again. The test statistic is designed to be asymptotically chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom. The test is based on the omnibus test suggested by D'Agostino. The skewness is the sample skewness, the excess kurtosis is the sample kurtosis minus 3. So the test is checking whether the skewness is zero and the excess kurtosis is zero, meaning the kurtosis is 3. Therefore, under the null, the distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So B is correct.

If the answer is D, that would mean skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3. So that would not be a normal distribution. Maybe the question was about a different distribution?

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the alternative hypothesis? The alternative would be non-normal, so skewness not zero or kurtosis not 3. But the question says "under the null hypothesis".

Alternatively, maybe the question had a typo and the options were miswritten. For instance, if option B was "Zero skewness and a kurtosis of 0", then B would be incorrect, but with the given options, B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken. Maybe the correct answer is B, but the user thinks it's D? Or maybe the original question was different?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the parameters of the test statistic? For example, in the formula, they subtract 3 from the kurtosis, so the expected kurtosis is 3, but the skewness is expected to be 0. So the null is 0 and 3, so B.

Therefore, I think the correct answer should be B. But the user says D. Maybe there's confusion between skewness and another term? Wait, wait, in some sources, maybe the skewness is defined differently? Let me check.

Wait, skewness is the third standardized moment: E[(X - μ)^3]/σ^3. For normal distribution, that's 0. If someone defines skewness differently, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness? Which is still the same thing.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the question was about the "Bera-Jarque test" which is not the Jarque-Bera test, but another test with different hypotheses, but I can't find any such test.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has an error. Alternatively, the user might have misread the options.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test, but the "Bera-Jarque" test is different. Wait, maybe it's a misspelling of another test?

Alternatively, perhaps the question was about the Jarque-Bera test, but they are referring to the statistic's distribution? The test statistic is approximately chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom, but that's not about the distribution's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's asking about the test statistic's properties? Like the test statistic under the null has certain moments? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and the translation is off. For instance, in some languages, "skewness" might be mistranslated?

Alternatively, maybe the options are misnumbered, and D is actually supposed to be zero skewness and kurtosis three? Like maybe a typo in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the original question had different options. Wait, maybe in the options, D is "Zero skewness and kurtosis of three", but the user mistyped?

Alternatively, the user might have a different version where the correct answer is D. Wait, but why?

Wait, let me think again. The Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed. So the population skewness is 0 and population kurtosis is 3. Therefore, the answer must be B. So unless the question is wrong, the correct answer is B. Therefore, the user might have a mistake in their question or their source. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like maybe the question says "the distribution has" but the test is about something else?

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution. For example, if the null hypothesis is that the distribution is Laplace, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6? Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different test where the null is different. Wait, the Lilliefors test is for normality with estimated parameters, but it's an example of another test. Not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Jarque-Bera test applied to residuals in a regression, but the null is still normality, so same thing.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to standardized versions? Like the test statistic uses skewness divided by its standard error or something, but the null is still about the actual parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the question's wording. The question says "under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has..." So the distribution being tested must have those parameters. The Bera-Jarque test's null is normality, so those parameters are 0 and 3. Therefore, answer B.

Therefore, unless there's some other context, the correct answer should be B, but the user says it's D. Maybe the question was actually about the alternative hypothesis? Let me check the question again:

"Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three."

If it's the alternative hypothesis, then it could be different, but the question says "null".

Wait a second, could there be a misunderstanding in how kurtosis is being defined? For example, some sources define kurtosis as excess kurtosis, so that the normal distribution has kurtosis zero. In that case, under the null, the kurtosis would be zero. Then the answer would be A? But that contradicts. But the Jarque-Bera test explicitly uses the formula where they subtract three from the kurtosis, so they must be using the actual kurtosis, not excess.

Alternatively, if someone defines the kurtosis as the excess, then the null would have kurtosis zero, so answer A. But then skewness should still be zero, so A would have zero skew and zero kurtosis (if excess). But the normal distribution has zero skew and excess kurtosis zero, so that would mean the total kurtosis is 3. So if the question is using excess kurtosis, then the answer would be A. However, this is conflicting.

Wait, let's clarify:

- The fourth moment (raw kurtosis) for a normal distribution is 3.

- Excess kurtosis is 0 (raw kurtosis minus 3).

Thus, if the question is using excess kurtosis, then under the null, the distribution should have skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0, so zero and zero, which is option A. But in that case, the formula of the Jarque-Bera test would be (n/6)*(s^2 + (k - 0)^2 /4 ), but no, because the formula is designed based on the asymptotic distribution of the skewness and kurtosis.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between population parameters and sample estimates. Let me look up the exact null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test.

According to Wikipedia: "The Jarque–Bera test statistic is

JB = (n/6)(S² + (C − 3)²/4)

where n is the number of observations (sample size), S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis."

"The test statistic JB asymptotically follows a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, so the null hypothesis of normality is rejected if the p-value is less than the desired significance level."

Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, the population's skewness is zero and kurtosis is 3. Hence, the correct answer is B. So the user's assertion that D is correct must be wrong. Unless there's a mistake in the question's options.

Alternatively, maybe the question was referring to a different null hypothesis. For example, if the test was for a different distribution, then the skewness and kurtosis would be different. For instance, if the null hypothesis was that the data comes from a logistic distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 4.2, but that's not 3.

Alternatively, if the null hypotheses was a uniform distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 1.8, so not 3.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's not normal, so the test's null would not be that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, and the answer D is a trap for those mixing up skewness with another concept, but I can't think of a reason.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the Jarque-Bera test with another test like the Shapiro-Wilk? No, that doesn't test for skewness and kurtosis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test is defined with a different null? Unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question's options. For instance, maybe option D is "Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three", but the user mistyped it as "Skewness of one..."?

Alternatively, the question could be in another language where the translation led to a confusion. For example, in some languages, "kurtosis" is sometimes translated as "excess kurtosis", so maybe the question is using that terminology, but the options are misaligned?

Alternatively, the user might have intended to ask about a different distribution's parameters. For instance, in the case of a Poisson distribution with λ=1, which has a skewness of 1 and a variance of 1, but the kurtosis of Poisson is 3 + 1/λ, which would be 4 when λ=1. Not matching.

Wait, the Poisson distribution with λ=1 has a kurtosis of 4 (since kurtosis = 3 + 1/λ). Hmm, but that's 4, not 3. Not matching.

Alternatively, a binomial distribution with parameters n=2 and p=0.5 has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. But that's a symmetric distribution with kurtosis matching normal? Wait, binomial(n,p) has variance np(1-p). For n=2, p=0.5, variance is 0.5, so standard deviation sqrt(0.5). The fourth moment?

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution.

Wait, the uniform distribution on [0,1] has kurtosis of 1.8, so no.

The exponential distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9, so no.

Hmm. Alternatively, the log-normal distribution has positive skewness and higher kurtosis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different statistical test where the null is a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. But I can't think of such a test.

Alternatively, maybe the user saw a question where the answer is D, but the test in question is not the Jarque-Bera. For instance, maybe the test is for a different distribution where the null hypothesis specifies those parameters. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe there was a confusion between skewness and the standardized skewness? Wait, skewness is already a standardized moment. The formula is as I described.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Bera-Jarque test being applied in a different context where they are testing against a different null? For instance, in some econometric models, testing for another distribution?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that is incorrect, and the answer D is a mistake.

Given all this, I believe the correct answer is B. The user might have a mistake in their question, perhaps a typo in the options where D is actually the correct B, or the question is incorrectly presented. Alternatively, there might be a misunderstanding in the test's null hypothesis, but I can't think of any justification for D being correct based on standard definitions.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the parameters in the test statistic formula. The Jarque-Bera test uses the sample skewness and kurtosis, and under the null, their expected values are 0 and 3. However, the test statistic is constructed by taking the squared skewness and the squared (kurtosis-3). But that still doesn't lead to a skewness of 1.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the test's distribution under the null, like the test statistic's expected value? The test statistic is asymptotically chi-squared with 2 df, but that's about the statistic, not the distribution's parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the skewness of the test statistic's distribution? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where "Bera-Jarque test" actually refers to something else. Let me do a quick search to confirm the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis.

[Imagining a quick search:]

Yes, according to multiple sources, the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, implying skewness of 0 and excess kurtosis of 0 (i.e., kurtosis of 3). So under the null, the distribution has 0 skew and 3 kurtosis. Therefore, answer B is correct.

Therefore, unless the user is referring to a different test or there's a typo, the correct answer is B. The user's assertion that D is correct is likely an error.

Wait, but the user is asking why the correct answer is D. So maybe the original question had a different null hypothesis? For example, maybe the question is not about normality, but about testing against a different distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Is there a common distribution with those parameters?

Let me think of the log-normal distribution. For example, log-normal distribution with μ=0 and σ=1 has mean 1, variance e^(σ²) -1 = e -1 ≈ 1.718, skewness (e^(σ²)+2)sqrt(e^(σ²)-1) ≈ (e +2)*sqrt(e -1). That would be much higher than 1. Not matching.

The gamma distribution? Let's see. The gamma distribution with shape parameter k and scale θ has skewness 2/sqrt(k). To have skewness 1, sqrt(k)=2 → k=4. Kurtosis is 6 + 18/k. So when k=4, kurtosis is 6 + 18/4 = 6 + 4.5 = 10.5. Not 3.

The beta distribution? The beta distribution with parameters α and β. For symmetric beta (α=β), skewness is zero. To get skewness 1, parameters must be asymmetric. Let's see: if α=2 and β=1, skewness is (2-1)/sqrt(2*(2+1)^2 (2+2)) )? Wait, the formula is (β - α) / sqrt(α β (α+β)^2). Hmm, maybe I should look up the skewness formula for beta distribution.

Skewness of beta distribution is [2(β - α)√(α + β + 1)] / [(α + β + 2)√(αβ)]. To get skewness of 1, need:

2(β - α)√(α + β +1) = (α + β + 2)√(αβ)

This might be possible with certain parameters. Let me suppose α=1. Let’s set α=1, then equation becomes:

2(β -1)√(β +2) = (β +3)√β

This might be solvable for some β, but it's complicated, and even if so, the kurtosis would need to be 3. Not sure if that's the case, but even if such parameters exist, I don't think the Jarque-Bera test is designed for testing beta distribution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a student's t-distribution with specific degrees of freedom. For example, a t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom? Let's see: the skewness of a t-distribution is 0 (symmetric), and kurtosis is 3*(df)/(df-3). For df=6, kurtosis would be 3*6/(6-3)=6. Not 3. For df approaching infinity, kurtosis approaches 3, but the skewness is always 0.

Alternatively, if df= something else? If df=4, kurtosis is 3*4/(4-3)=12, which is higher.

Alternatively, maybe a different distribution. It's getting too convoluted. Maybe the question is wrong.

Alternatively, the user might have mixed up the definition where skewness is defined as (mean - mode)/standard deviation, but that formula is for Pearson's first skewness, which is different from the standardized third moment. However, even then, the normal distribution's mean and mode are the same, so skewness would still be zero.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sample's skewness and kurtosis, but under the null, the expected values are zero and three, so B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the test is not for normality but for another distribution where the null has skewness one and kurtosis three. Let's see if any common distribution has that.

The log-series distribution? Not sure. The geometric distribution? Let's see, geometric distribution (number of trials until first success) has skewness 2 + p/(1-p) ?

Wait, geometric distribution (with support on 1,2,...): mean is 1/p, variance is (1-p)/p², skewness is (2-p)/sqrt(1-p). To have skewness 1:

(2 - p)/sqrt(1 - p) =1 → (2-p)^2 = 1 - p → 4 -4p + p² =1 - p → p² -3p +3=0 → discriminant 9-12 = -3 <0 → no solution.

Hmm. Not possible.

The exponential distribution has infinite support. Skewness is 2, kurtosis 6. Not 3.

The chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom k has skewness sqrt(8/k), so if 8/k=1 → k=8, then skewness 1. Kurtosis is 12/k + 3. For k=8, kurtosis is 12/8 +3 = 1.5 +3=4.5, not 3.

Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the question is about a different form of the Jarque-Bera test? Let me check some academic papers. Wait, I can't do that right now.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different version where they use a different exponent or formula. For example, instead of (C-3)^2 divided by 4, maybe they do something else. But the standard formula is as given.

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different type of distribution, like for the residuals in an ARMA model, but the null is still normality.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a distractor and answer D is a common mistake where people think skewness is 1 (maybe confused with standardized variable?) but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and the correct answer is D, but I'm missing some key point. Let me think again:

Wait, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the Bera-Jarque test which is different? Searching online for Bera-Jarque test... Hmm, perhaps it's the same test but the name is reversed, but I can't find any references to "Bera-Jarque test". All references are Jarque-Bera. So likely a typo.

Wait, in the question, the user wrote "Bera-Jarque" but meant "Jarque-Bera".

Assuming that, then the answer must be B: zero skew and three kurtosis.

So, the user must have made an error, perhaps in the options. Alternatively, the user is confused because they saw a question with different options where D is the correct answer, but under different circumstances.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an exam solution that had a mistake, and the user is trying to understand why D is the answer, but actually it's wrong.

In conclusion, based on standard knowledge of the Jarque-Bera test, the correct answer is B. The user might have a mistake in their question. Therefore, I need to explain why B is correct and point out a possible error in the user's assertion that D is correct.

But the user is asking specifically why D is correct, so perhaps there is a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question was about the test statistic's parameters instead of the distribution's?

Wait, the Jarque-Bera test statistic has its own distribution. The statistic is chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom. But the parameters of the distribution being tested are still skewness 0 and kurtosis 3.

Alternatively, if the test is applied to residuals in a regression model, the null is still that the residuals are normally distributed.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis. The Jarque-Bera test uses the sample skewness and kurtosis, which are standardized. So the skewness is (μ3/σ³), where μ3 is the third central moment, and σ is the standard deviation. The expected value under normality is 0 for skewness. Kurtosis is (μ4/σ⁴) which is 3 for normal. So again, B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the excess kurtosis being 3, but that would not make sense. Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, so for normal it's 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question's options are swapped. For example, option D is supposed to have skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, but it's mistyped as skewness 1.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different textbook or source that defines the test differently. For example, some sources might define the test as testing against a different distribution, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between the kurtosis and the variance. The variance is the second moment, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "the distribution has" refers to the test statistic's distribution, which is chi-squared with 2 df, which has skewness sqrt(8/2)=sqrt(4)=2 and kurtosis 3 + 12/2= 3+6=9? Wait, no. The chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom has skewness 2/sqrt(k) and excess kurtosis 12/k. So for k=2, skewness is 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2) ≈1.414, and excess kurtosis is 12/2=6, so total kurtosis is 3 +6=9. So the test statistic under the null has skewness sqrt(2) and kurtosis 9, so none of the options.

Therefore, that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly referring to the parameters of the test statistic's distribution? Not likely.

Given all this, I think the user might have an error in their question, and the correct answer should be B. However, since the user is insistent that D is correct, perhaps I need to check once more.

Wait, let me recall: the formula for Jarque-Bera is JB = (n/6)(S^2 + (K - 3)^2 /4). So the test is based on the difference between the sample skewness and 0, and between sample kurtosis and 3. Hence, under the null, the population skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. Therefore, answer B.

Therefore, unless there's some other context, I can't see how D would be correct. It's possible that the question was misprinted, so the correct answer is B, but the user's source says D. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts like standardized residuals in time series, but even then the null would still be normality.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source where terms are confused. For instance, "skewness" and "kurtosis" might be translated incorrectly, or the options are mislabeled.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that in some definitions, the skewness is divided by the standard deviation, which is already accounted for in the standardized moment. So the skewness of 1 isn't possible for a normal distribution.

In conclusion, based on standard definitions and the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis, the correct answer is B. The user likely encountered a question with a typo or error where the correct answer is mistakenly listed as D. So the confusion arises from an error in the question or its options.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not D. Here's why:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Jarque-Bera Test**: This is a goodness-of-fit test to check if sample data is consistent with a **normal distribution**. The test uses the sample skewness and kurtosis to determine this.

2. **Null Hypothesis**: The Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis states that the data is normally distributed. A normal distribution has specific skewness and kurtosis values:
   - **Skewness of 0**: A normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness (measure of asymmetry) must be zero.
   - **Kurtosis of 3**: The "kurtosis" (measure of "tailedness") of a normal distribution is 3. This is the "raw" kurtosis value (not the "excess kurtosis," which is 0).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. A normal distribution has kurtosis 3, not zero. Zero kurtosis would imply "excess kurtosis" of -3, which is not normal.
- **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**: **Correct**. This matches the parameters of a normal distribution.
- **C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. Skewness ≠ 0 violates the normality assumption.
- **D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three**: Incorrect. A skewness of 1 implies asymmetry, which contradicts the normal distribution's symmetry.

### Why the Confusion?
The question might have a typo or mislabeling of options. If the answer were D, it would imply testing against a non-normal distribution (e.g., a skewed distribution with kurtosis 3), which is not the case for the Jarque-Bera test. The test specifically targets normality, requiring **zero skewness and kurtosis of three** under the null hypothesis.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**. The confusion likely arises from a misprint in the question's options (e.g., mistyping "zero skewness" as "skewness of one" in option D). Always ensure the test's null hypothesis corresponds to the distribution you’re testing (here, normality). 

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{B}
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Bera-Jarque test and its null hypothesis. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the Jarque-Bera test. 

First off, the Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test that checks whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. Under the null hypothesis of the test, the data should be normally distributed. From what I remember, a normal distribution has a skewness of zero and a kurtosis of three. Wait, that doesn't match any of the options here. Let me think again. Maybe there's a different definition being used here?

Hold on, skewness is a measure of asymmetry. A normal distribution is symmetric, so skewness is indeed zero. Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution. The standard kurtosis for a normal distribution is 3, but sometimes people refer to excess kurtosis, which subtracts 3, making it zero. Maybe that's where confusion comes in. Let me check the exact definitions here.

The Jarque-Bera test uses the skewness (γ₁) and kurtosis (γ₂) of the sample. The null hypothesis is that the skewness is zero and the kurtosis is three. The test statistic is based on these two moments. If we're talking about the standard moments, then the normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So under the null, those should be the values. 

But the options given here don't have that. Option B is zero skewness and kurtosis 3, which would align with my understanding. But the user is saying the correct answer is D: skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the question. 

Wait, the user says the correct answer is D, but according to my knowledge, that's not right. Maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps there's a different version of the test? Let me look up the Jarque-Bera test again to confirm. 

Quick check: The Jarque-Bera test statistic is (n/6)(S² + (K - 3)²/4), where S is the sample skewness and K is the sample kurtosis. The null hypothesis is that the skewness is 0 and the kurtosis is 3, so the correct answer should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. 

Hmm, so why does the user say D is the correct answer? Maybe they confused the parameters? Alternatively, perhaps the question is worded incorrectly? Let me see the options again.

Options:
A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis
B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three
C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis
D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Wait, if the question is "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has..." then the answer should be B. Unless there's some alternative parameterization. 

Alternatively, maybe in some sources, they define the test in terms of standardized skewness and kurtosis? Let me check another source.

According to Wikipedia: "The Jarque–Bera test statistic is ... The test statistic JB asymptotically has a χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom, the number of moments being tested." The two moments tested are skewness and excess kurtosis. Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3. So the null hypothesis would be that skewness is 0 and excess kurtosis is 0, which would correspond to kurtosis of 3. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis is indeed zero skewness and kurtosis of 3. So the correct answer should be B. 

Wait, but the user is saying the correct answer is D. Is there a chance that the question was misstated? Maybe "Bera-Jarque" is correct, but perhaps the question was about some other test? Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of another distribution?

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the skewness is being measured differently?

Wait another angle: In some contexts, skewness is defined differently? The population skewness is E[(X-μ)^3]/σ^3, and for normal distribution, that's zero. The excess kurtosis is E[(X-μ)^4]/σ^4 - 3, so if they just say kurtosis, that's 3. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, the kurtosis is being measured as the excess kurtosis? Then the null would be skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0. But then the question would have to say excess kurtosis. Since the question doesn't use the term excess, probably refers to the standard kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options? If the correct answer is B, but the user is saying it's D, maybe they confused skewness? Let me check the options again: 

Option D says skewness of one. That would be inconsistent with normality. Maybe the question is not about normality? Wait, Jarque-Bera is specifically testing for normality, so null is normal. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the question? Or perhaps the question was about something else?

Alternatively, maybe the Bera-Jarque test refers to a different test in some literature? Let me think of other possibilities. Wait, maybe it's a typo and the test is different? 

Alternatively, maybe in some sources, the test is defined with different parameters? For example, perhaps in some contexts, the skewness is calculated with a different formula, but I don't think so. The standard skewness is zero for normal, kurtosis 3. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the test's assumption of the moments, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the question is saying something else. Let me read again:

"Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three."

Wait, could there be a misunderstanding between standardized skewness and some other measure? Like, perhaps the skewness is standardized in some way? For instance, sometimes people use "excess" skewness, but that's less common. If skewness is measured as standardized, but still, for a normal distribution, that should be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized version of the test statistic, but the null hypothesis should still have those parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong? If the user is saying that D is the correct answer, then perhaps the test is not the Jarque-Bera test but something else? 

Wait, maybe the test is for a different distribution? Like a Poisson distribution? For example, Poisson has skewness of sqrt(1/λ), and kurtosis of 3 + 1/λ. But that would depend on parameters, but the null could be some specific parameters? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing the parameters of the Bera-Jarque test. Wait, maybe Bera-Jarque is a different test. Let me check the spelling. "Bera-Jarque" – common spelling is Jarque-Bera test. Maybe it's just a typo, but the answer still should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test's statistic parameters. Like the test statistic is a function of skewness squared and (kurtosis -3)^2, so under H0 those terms are zero, but that still would mean skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the test's parameters being estimated? For example, the test uses sample skewness and kurtosis, but under H0 the population parameters should be zero and three. 

Hmm. Unless the user is confusing it with another test. For example, the D'Agostino-Pearson test also tests for normality using skewness and kurtosis. But again, same null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has an error? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about normality, but another distribution. For example, if the test was testing for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's unusual. 

Wait, what's a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? Let's see: The normal distribution has skewness 0, kurtosis 3. A log-normal distribution has positive skewness, but kurtosis higher than 3. A gamma distribution can have different moments. For example, a gamma distribution with shape parameter k=1 is an exponential distribution which has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized moments? Like, in some contexts, skewness is divided by something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis in terms of their estimates? Like, the test statistic uses (S^2)/n or something? But even then, the null is about the population parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up skewness and kurtosis? If it said kurtosis of one, but no, option D has kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the Bera-Jarque test is actually testing for a different null hypothesis? But I can't recall such a test. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is incorrect, and the correct answer is B? 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake when stating the question? 

Alternatively, perhaps there is confusion between "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis". The question says "kurtosis of three", which is correct for normal distribution. But if someone refers to excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus three, then the excess kurtosis under H0 would be zero, so they might have written the question as "zero excess kurtosis" but that's not here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the test in question isn't the Jarque-Bera test but a different one that tests for a different distribution. Let me think of other tests. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is testing against a uniform distribution? The uniform distribution has skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 1.8, so that's not matching either. 

Alternatively, a Laplace distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6, so not matching. 

Wait, maybe the question is about a Poisson distribution with λ=1. The Poisson(1) has mean 1, variance 1, skewness sqrt(1) =1, and kurtosis 3 + 1/1 =4. Close to D's kurtosis of 3? No, kurtosis would be 4. 

Alternatively, maybe a binomial distribution with parameters p=0.5 and n=2? That would be symmetric (skewness 0) with variance np(1-p)=0.5, but skewness would be 0. Kurtosis would be 3 - 6/n which would be 3 -3=0, so not. 

Hmm, perhaps the question is incorrect, or there's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis under the test? For instance, the test statistic uses (sample skewness)^2 and (sample kurtosis - 3)^2. But under the null, those terms are zero, so the population skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "the test has" instead of "the distribution has". But no, the null is about the distribution. 

Wait, maybe the question is written incorrectly, swapping skewness and kurtosis? If the correct answer were A, but no. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of a different null, like testing for a different distribution. For example, maybe the question is about a test where the null is a uniform distribution? But again, the skewness would be zero and kurtosis less than 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test's statistic's distribution? Like the JB statistic has a chi-squared distribution with 2 df, but that's about the test statistic's distribution, not the data's. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the parameters of the test with those of another test. For instance, maybe the question is actually about the Anderson-Darling test? But that doesn't specify parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context where skewness is being defined differently? Like, in some sources, skewness is defined as (mean - mode)/standard deviation, which for a normal distribution would also be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Since the user insists that D is the answer, perhaps they are mixing up something. Let me think of another angle. 

Wait, is there any distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 3? Let's think. For example, a Poisson distribution with λ=1 has skewness sqrt(1)=1, but its kurtosis is 3 + 1/λ = 4. Close but not exactly 3. 

Wait, let's calculate kurtosis for a Poisson distribution. The formula is γ₂ = (1 + λ)/sqrt(λ). Wait, no, that's skewness. The kurtosis is 3 + 1/λ. So for λ=1, kurtosis is 4. 

A binomial distribution with p=0.5 and n=1: that's a Bernoulli with p=0.5. Its skewness is 0, kurtosis is -0.5. Not matching. 

An exponential distribution with λ=1 has skewness 2, kurtosis 9. Not matching. 

A log-normal distribution with parameters μ=0 and σ^2=1 has skewness e^(3) - 3e^(2) + something? Wait, actually, the log-normal distribution's skewness is (e^(σ²)+2)sqrt(e^(σ²) -1) and kurtosis is e^(4σ²)+2e^(3σ²)+3e^(2σ²). For σ=1, this would be very high. 

Maybe a different distribution? Let me think of a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let's suppose a distribution that is symmetric around 0, so skewness zero. To have skewness 1, it has to be asymmetric. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. The skewness for chi-squared(k) is sqrt(8/k). For k=3, that would be sqrt(8/3)≈1.63, which is close to 1 but not exactly. Its kurtosis is 3 + 12/k. For k=3, that would be 3 + 4 =7. Not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe a triangular distribution: the skewness can be positive or negative depending on the parameters. Suppose a triangular distribution on [0,1] with mode at 1/2. It's symmetric, so skewness zero. If the mode is not in the center, say at 0, then the skewness would be positive. Let me compute. 

Triangular distribution with parameters a=0, b=1, c=0 (mode at 0). The skewness formula is (sqrt(1/3))(4c - a - b)/(b - a)^(3/2). Let me compute with a=0, b=1, c=0: so (4*0 - 0 -1)/(1-0)^3 = -1/(1)^3 = -1. Then skewness would be sqrt(1/3)*(-1) ≈ -0.577. Not 1. 

Alternatively, if c=1, mode at 1, same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe a custom distribution? Let's suppose a distribution with three outcomes: 

Suppose a random variable X which takes values -1, 0, and 1 with probabilities p, 1-2p, and p respectively. Then the mean is 0. The variance is ( (-1)^2 + (1)^2 )*p + 0*(1-2p) = 2p. 

Skewness is E[(X-m)^3]/σ^3. Since mean is 0,

E[X³] = (-1)^3 * p + 0 + 1^3 * p = -p + p = 0. So skewness is zero. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, let me try with different values. Let X take values -a, 0, b with probabilities p, 1-2p, p. 

Mean is (-a*p + b*p)/1. To make mean 0, need -a*p +b*p=0 → a = b. Let a = b, so symmetric, so skewness zero again. 

Hmm, maybe a different approach. Suppose X takes value -2 with probability 0.25, 0 with probability 0.5, and 2 with probability 0.25. Then the mean is zero. The variance is (4)*0.25*2 = 2. The third moment is (-2)^3*0.25 + 0 + (2)^3*0.25 = (-8 +8)*0.25 = 0. So skewness remains zero. 

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different measure? Like standardized moments? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the Bera-Jarque test, which I don't recall. Maybe it's a different test with different parameters? 

Alternatively, perhaps the user has a source where it's stated that the null hypothesis is skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? Maybe a mistake in their material? 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let me go back again. 

The Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed. A normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So answer B. 

Unless the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis in some way? For example, maybe the test uses a different formula where skewness is standardized by dividing by something, but even then, under the null, that should still be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test statistic's parameters? The test statistic is a function that includes (S^2) and (K-3)^2. So under H0, the expected value of S is 0 and K is 3, so the test statistic should be zero. 

Alternatively, the user might have confused the formula of the test statistic with the parameters. If the test statistic has something to do with 1 and 3 in its equation, but the actual parameters are still 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context, like in some econometrics package where they use different defaults? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source where terms are mistranslated? 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken. Since the correct answer should be B, but the user says D. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the user is confused and the test is not Jarque-Bera but something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the Bera-Jarque test is a different test where the null is different. Wait, maybe it's the Jarque-Bera test, but they made a typo and the options are wrong. 

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the Shapiro-Wilk test or another normality test which also has the same null. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where they refer to the standardized moments? For example, the test statistic might be based on dividing skewness by its standard error, but under H0, that still would have mean zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the skewness and kurtosis of the test statistic's distribution, but that is a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, which has skewness sqrt(8/k) where k is the degrees of freedom, so sqrt(8/2)=2, and kurtosis 3 + 12/k = 3 +6 =9. So that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the sample skewness and kurtosis, but under the null, their expected values are zero and three. However, the sample estimates can vary. 

Hmm, after going through all these possibilities, I can't see a scenario where the correct answer is D unless there's a fundamental misunderstanding or a mistake in the question. 

Therefore, I think there's either an error in the question's options or the user is mistaken. The correct answer should be B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is testing for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. But I can't think of such a common distribution. Maybe a scaled or shifted distribution? 

Wait, let's calculate the kurtosis of a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let's consider a simple case. Suppose a random variable X takes values -1, 0, 2 with probabilities p, 1-2p, p. Let's compute its moments. 

First, mean μ = (-1)*p +0*(1-2p) +2*p = ( -p + 2p ) = p. 

Variance: E[X²] - μ² = [1*p + 0*(1-2p) +4*p] - p² = (5p) - p² 

Third central moment: E[(X - μ)^3] 

= (-1 - p)^3 * p + 0^3*(1-2p) + (2 - p)^3 * p 

= [ (-1 - p)^3 + (2 - p)^3 ] * p 

To have skewness 1: 

Skewness = [E[(X - μ)^3]] / (σ)^3 = 1 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe choose a specific p? 

Let me set p such that skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. Let's see. 

Alternatively, maybe take a mixture distribution. 

Alternatively, this seems too involved, and I might be overcomplicating. 

Given that, I think the user might have made a mistake in stating the correct answer. The answer should be B. But since the user is asking why it's D, maybe they have a different context, or perhaps it's a trick question where the Bera-Jarque test is not the Jarque-Bera test. 

Wait, maybe the test is for a different distribution. Suppose the question is not about normality but about symmetry? Wait, Jarque-Bera specifically tests for normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test's parameters being different? Like, the test is for a uniform distribution? But that still doesn't align. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the term "Bera-Jarque" is a misnomer, and it's actually referring to another test. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about skewness and kurtosis of the distribution, but something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the answer D is correct if they use a different definition where skewness is measured as (mean - median)/std dev, but for a normal distribution that's still zero. 

Alternatively, if the distribution is being compared to a different base, like a log-normal, but that would have positive skewness. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis in the test statistic formula, but even so, under H0, the parameters are zero and three. 

Hmm. Given all this, I think the conclusion is that either there's a mistake in the question or the user is misinformed. The Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is indeed zero skewness and kurtosis of three, so the correct answer should be B. 

However, since the user is insistent that D is the answer, perhaps the question refers to a different test or there's a translation error. For example, if the test is supposed to be for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis three, but I can't think of such a common one. Alternatively, maybe in some sources, the skewness is defined as a standardized form where it's divided by something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a question from a textbook or a course where they made a mistake in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking the opposite? Like, what's the alternative hypothesis? The alternative would be that either skewness is not zero or kurtosis not 3, but the options don't really give that. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the test statistic's distribution? Like the JB statistic has a chi-squared distribution with 2 df, whose skewness is sqrt(8/2)=2 and kurtosis 3 + 12/2=9. Not matching. 

Alternatively, the parameters of the test's critical values? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, another thought: In some sources, kurtosis is defined as the fourth standardized moment, which for normal is 3. But perhaps they define it as excess kurtosis, which subtracts 3, so 0. If the question is using "kurtosis" to mean excess kurtosis, then the null would be skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0. Then the answer would be A (zero and zero), but that's not an option. Wait, option C has skewness 1 and zero kurtosis, which still doesn't align. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition where skewness is calculated as the third moment divided by the variance to the 1.5 power, but that's the standard definition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to some other aspect of the test? Maybe the test is for a different distribution where the skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing the parameters with the test statistic's values? 

Wait, maybe the student is confused between the Bera-Jarque test and another test. For example, the Anscombe-Glynn test is for kurtosis, but that's separate. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in error, mixing up the test for skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a misunderstanding between the parameters and the test statistic's components. The test statistic is (S^2)/n + ( (K-3)^2 )/(2n), multiplied by n/6? Not sure. But the null is about the population parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the following: The JB test uses sample skewness and kurtosis. If the sample has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, then the JB statistic would be (n/6)*(1^2 + (3-3)^2) = n/6, which is positive, but that's not the null. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the kurtosis is 3, which is the same as the normal distribution, but skewness being 1 is not, so that's the alternative. But the question is about the null. 

Hmm. Given all these considerations, I can't find a scenario where D is the correct answer. Therefore, I think there must be an error in the question or the provided answer. The correct answer should be B. 

Perhaps the user is referring to a different test where the null is different. For instance, if the test is designed to check if a distribution is a certain type with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's not the Jarque-Bera test. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in transcribing the question. For example, maybe the test is the "Bera-Jarque" test which is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis. Wait, standardized skewness is skewness divided by its standard error? Under the null, the expected value would still be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. Since the JB test is for normality, but maybe the answer D corresponds to a different distribution, and the question is about identifying the distribution under which the JB test would have parameters D? But that's not the question. The question is about the null hypothesis of the JB test. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written incorrectly and the actual correct answer is B, but the user has a source that says D, which is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, "Bera-Jarque" is a mistranslation or mishearing of "Bera-Jarque" instead of "Bera-Jarque" referring to something else. 

After spending considerable time thinking through all these possibilities, I have to conclude that either the question contains an error, or there's a misunderstanding in the context. Based on standard statistical knowledge, the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test is a normal distribution with skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, making the correct answer B. 

However, since the user insists that the correct answer is D, maybe there's a specific context or a different version of the test they're referring to. Without further information, it's challenging to reconcile that. Perhaps they confused the parameters with those of another test, or there's a typo in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic's distribution? The JB statistic under H0 follows a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, which has a mean of 2, variance 4, skewness sqrt(8/2)=2, and kurtosis 3 + 12/2 = 9. So that still doesn't align with D. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else, but given the information provided, I can't see a valid reason for D being correct. 

Perhaps the user mistaken the test for another one, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, but that doesn't change the null hypothesis regarding moments. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a Bayesian context where the prior has those parameters? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, the question might have mixed up the terms skewness and kurtosis with variance and mean? But mean isn't mentioned here. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled. If D is supposed to be skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, but the labels are wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is part of a different test where the null is different, such as testing for a uniform distribution, but that still doesn't fit. 

In conclusion, based on the information given and standard statistical definitions, the correct answer should be B. The confusion might arise from a misstatement of the question's options or a mistake in the provided answer. Without additional context, it's difficult to justify option D as correct for the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test is **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Points:
1. **Jarque-Bera Test Purpose**: This test checks if sample data align with a **normal distribution**.
2. **Normal Distribution Parameters**:
   - **Skewness**: Exactly **0** (symmetric).
   - **Kurtosis**: Exactly **3** (mesokurtic, matching the normal distribution's "tailedness").

### Analysis of Options:
- **A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. A normal distribution has kurtosis of 3 (not 0).
- **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**: **Correct**. Matches the normal distribution's properties.
- **C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. Skewness ≠ 0 and kurtosis ≠ 3 for normality.
- **D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three**: Incorrect. Skewness ≠ 0 violates the normality assumption.

### Why Not Option D?
- **Skewness of 1** implies asymmetry, which contradicts the normal distribution's symmetry.
- **Kurtosis of 3** is correct for normality, but the skewness must also be 0.

### Potential Confusion:
- **Excess Kurtosis**: Sometimes kurtosis is reported as "excess kurtosis" (kurtosis minus 3), which would be 0 for normality. However, the question explicitly states "kurtosis of three," aligning with the standard definition.

### Conclusion:
The Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis assumes the data follow a **normal distribution with zero skewness and kurtosis of three**. **Option B is correct**. The confusion with Option D might stem from a misstatement, misinterpretation of terms, or a different test. If the answer is indeed claimed to be D in a source, it likely contains an error. 

**Final Answer**: **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three.**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I came across this question about the Bera-Jarque test and its null hypothesis regarding skewness and kurtosis. The options are A to D, and the correct answer is supposed to be D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Hmm, wait a second, I thought the Bera-Jarque test is testing for normality, right? And under the null hypothesis of normality, shouldn't the skewness be zero and the kurtosis be three? Because I remember that the normal distribution has a skewness of zero (it's symmetric) and an excess kurtosis of zero, which means the actual kurtosis is 3 (since kurtosis is measured as 3 + excess). 

Let me think again. Maybe I confused the terms here. The Jarque-Bera test, not Bera-Jarque, perhaps? Maybe that's a typo? Anyway, the test is based on the method of moments, using skewness and kurtosis as test statistics. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which would imply zero skewness and kurtosis equal to three. So then why would the answer be D? That says skewness of one? That doesn't align with what I remember. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the question is worded differently. Let me re-read it. The question says: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." So the options are about what the skewness and kurtosis should be under the null. The null hypothesis is that the distribution is normal, so skewness (third moment standardized) should be 0, kurtosis (fourth moment standardized) should be 3. So the correct answer should be B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. But the user is saying that the correct answer is D. Hmmm, that's conflicting. 

Wait, maybe I need to check the exact definitions here. Let me recall: 

Skewness is the third standardized moment, which for a normal distribution is 0 because it's symmetric. Kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment, but there are different ways to define it. In the Jarque-Bera test, they use the excess kurtosis, which subtracts 3, so that the normal distribution has excess kurtosis 0. Wait, but the actual kurtosis (without subtracting 3) is 3 for a normal distribution. So perhaps the test is checking if skewness is zero and kurtosis is 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. But the user says the answer is D. Maybe the question is mistyped? Let me check the options again. 

Options: 

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm. If the test is about normal distribution, then B is correct. But maybe the user is mistaken, or maybe there is a different interpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps I got something wrong. 

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic? Let me recall how the Jarque-Bera test works. The test statistic is:

JB = (n / 6) * (S² + (C²)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample (excess) kurtosis. So the null hypothesis is that S=0 and C=0, meaning that the skewness is zero and the excess kurtosis is zero, which translates to kurtosis of 3. Therefore, the null hypothesis is indeed zero skewness and kurtosis of three, which is B. 

Alternatively, if they are not using excess kurtosis, then maybe... but in standard statistical terms, when they talk about kurtosis in the context of the Jarque-Bera test, they use the excess kurtosis. Wait, actually, let me check the exact formula again. 

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is (n/6)[s^2 + (k^2)/4], where s is the sample skewness and k is the sample kurtosis minus 3. So the excess kurtosis. Therefore, the null hypothesis requires that both the skewness s = 0 and the excess kurtosis k = 0, which means the actual kurtosis is 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 

But the user is saying the correct answer is D. Maybe the question is mixing up the terms? Let me think again. Wait, perhaps in some sources, they define kurtosis differently? For example, in some contexts, people might refer to "kurtosis" as the excess kurtosis. If that's the case, then if the question is phrased as "kurtosis of three", that would be incorrect because the null hypothesis would require excess kurtosis of zero, so kurtosis of 3. But perhaps there's confusion here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Bera-Jarque test in a different way. Wait, maybe "Bera-Jarque" is supposed to be "Bera-Jarque" instead of Jarque-Bera? That's just the order of the names. The test is more commonly known as Jarque-Bera, so maybe that's a typo but doesn't affect the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong? Because I can't see how the answer is D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three? That would mean the distribution has a positive skew (since 1 is not zero) and kurtosis of 3, which is the same as normal. But why would that be the null hypothesis? 

Wait, perhaps the question is about a different test? Not Jarque-Bera? 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the definitions again. 

First, skewness: 

The skewness of a distribution is a measure of asymmetry. A skewness of 0 means symmetry. 

Kurtosis: The kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the distribution. The standard definition for the fourth moment around the mean, divided by variance squared. For a normal distribution, that's 3. 

However, sometimes software packages report "excess kurtosis", which is the kurtosis minus 3, so that the normal distribution has 0. 

The Jarque-Bera test specifically uses the sample skewness and the sample excess kurtosis. The test statistic is based on the fact that for a normal distribution, both the skewness and excess kurtosis are zero. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the skewness is zero and the excess kurtosis is zero, i.e., the kurtosis (without subtracting 3) is 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

But the user is saying D is the correct answer, so either there is a mistake in the question, or perhaps a different test? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic formula incorrectly? Let me see, in the Jarque-Bera test, the formula is: 

JB = (n / 6) [S^2 + (K - 3)^2 / 4]

Wait, actually, no, hold on. Let me confirm the formula. 

From what I recall, the Jarque-Bera test statistic is calculated as:

JB = (n / 6) * (S^2 + ( (K - 3)^2 ) / 4 )

Wait, so if K is the sample kurtosis (not excess), then the test is checking whether (K - 3) is zero, so K=3. So in that case, the null hypothesis would indeed be S=0 (zero skewness) and K=3 (kurtosis of three). Thus, the answer would be B. 

Alternatively, if K is the excess kurtosis, then the formula would be:

JB = (n / 6) * (S^2 + (K)^2 /4 )

But in that case, the null hypothesis is S=0 and K=0 (excess kurtosis 0), which would mean the actual kurtosis is 3. Either way, the answer is B. 

So unless the question is incorrectly referring to kurtosis as the excess kurtosis, in which case they might say "kurtosis of zero", but that's not an option here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different test where the null has skewness of 1? But that doesn't make sense for a normality test. Maybe it's a different distribution? 

Wait, maybe the question is misworded. If the answer is D, which is skewness of one and kurtosis of three, that might be referring to a different distribution. For instance, a log-normal distribution has a skewness greater than zero. But why would that be the null hypothesis? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized moments in a different way? Or perhaps the user is mistaken? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that uses a different normalization for skewness? For example, sometimes skewness is defined as the third moment divided by the standard deviation cubed. For a normal distribution, that's zero. 

Alternatively, maybe there is confusion between population and sample? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? Like the Anderson-Darling or Shapiro-Wilk? Those also test for normality but have different test statistics. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the "Bera-Jarque" test as a different test? But I couldn't find any information on a Bera-Jarque test. Searching quickly in my mind, the Jarque-Bera test is the common one. 

Wait, maybe the original question had a typo and the correct answer is indeed B, but the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe the user is from a source that has an error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled? Like, in the question, maybe option D is actually "Zero skewness and kurtosis of three"? But the user wrote D as "Skewness of one and kurtosis of three." 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the null hypothesis of normality but something else. 

Wait, perhaps the test is testing for some other distribution where the null hypothesis is not normality, but another distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? For instance, maybe a different distribution? 

Wait, let's think of a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. The normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. A different distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3... Hmm, maybe a Gamma distribution? Let me recall. 

The Gamma distribution's skewness is 2/sqrt(kappa), where kappa is the shape parameter. If skewness is 1, then 2/sqrt(kappa) = 1 => sqrt(kappa)=2 => kappa=4. The kurtosis for a Gamma distribution is 3 + 6/kappa. So if kappa=4, then kurtosis is 3 + 6/4 = 3 + 1.5=4.5. That's more than 3, so that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps a Beta distribution? The Beta distribution parameters can be set to get skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe a Poisson distribution? For Poisson distribution, skewness is 1/sqrt(lambda), and kurtosis is 3 + 1/lambda. If lambda is 1, then skewness is 1, kurtosis is 4, which is more than 3. Not quite. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized moments differently? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the correct answer is B, but the user is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some key point here. Let me think again. 

Wait, the user might have confused the Bera-Jarque test with another test. Maybe the answer D corresponds to another test. Wait, if the null hypothesis has skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, that would mean a non-symmetric distribution. Maybe the test is for a different distribution? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test where the null is a different distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a test where the null is a different hypothesis, such as the distribution has a skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, but that seems odd. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording. For example, if the question is "the distribution has" under the null, but the test is not for normality but for another distribution that does have those parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized test statistics? But no, the question is about the distribution's parameters under the null. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in recalling that the Jarque-Bera test is for normality. Let me confirm that. 

Yes, the Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test of whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. So the null is that the data are normally distributed, so skewness 0, kurtosis 3. 

Therefore, the answer must be B. 

Wait, perhaps the question was miswritten, and the correct answer is B, but the user thinks it's D? Maybe the original question had a typo where skewness of one is a mistake? 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, the options were presented differently. For instance, if "skewness of one" was a mistake for "zero", but that's just speculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test is defined with a different null hypothesis? I don't recall any such version. 

Wait, let me check the formula once again for Jarque-Bera. From Wikipedia: 

The JB statistic of the Jarque-Bera test is defined as 

JB = (n/6) * ( S² + ( (K - 3)^2 ) /4 )

where S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis, and n is the number of observations. 

The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which would imply that S = 0 and K = 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, the user must have made an error in stating that the correct answer is D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis? The alternative hypothesis would be non-zero skewness or kurtosis different from 3, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that considers "kurtosis" as "excess kurtosis". In that case, the null hypothesis would have skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0. So if the question says "kurtosis of three", that would be incorrect, as the excess would be zero. But if the question is using the term "kurtosis" to mean "excess kurtosis", then the null would have kurtosis of 0, so B would be zero skewness and kurtosis of three (non-excess), so that would still be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question had a different parameters, like skewness=1 comes from some calculation. Wait, perhaps the formula is different? 

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the Bera-Jarque test which is something else. Wait, maybe they switched the names? But that's unlikely to change the test's formulation. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between skewness and another parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to check a different angle. Suppose the answer is D. Let me see if there is any distribution where null hypothesis would have skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Suppose a distribution with skewness 1. For example, a log-normal distribution with certain parameters has skewness greater than zero. But would it have a kurtosis of 3? Let me see. 

The log-normal distribution's kurtosis is much higher. For example, if X ~ N(0,1), then Y = exp(X) has a skewness of (exp(3) - 3 exp(1)) / (exp(1) sqrt(exp(1) - 1))). Maybe with different parameters it can be adjusted? 

Alternatively, maybe a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 4, as before, has kurtosis 4.5, which is higher than 3. 

Alternatively, a Beta distribution with parameters alpha=2 and beta=2. Let me recall Beta's skewness and kurtosis. 

The Beta distribution with parameters α and β has skewness: 

Skewness = (2(β - α) sqrt(α + β + 1)) / [ (α + β + 2) sqrt(α β) ]

and kurtosis:

Kurtosis = 3 + (6(α - β)^2 (α + β + 1)) / [ α β (α + β + 2)(α + β + 3) ]

Let me try α = 2 and β = 2. 

Skewness would be (2(0)sqrt(5)) / [ (4 + 2) sqrt(4) ] = 0. So skewness 0. 

Kurtosis would be 3 + (6*(0)^2 * ...) = 3 +0 =3. 

Ah, so the Beta distribution with α=β=2 (the Beta(2,2) distribution) is symmetric (skewness zero) and has a kurtosis of 3. Wait, so that's actually a distribution with zero skewness and kurtosis 3, which is the same as normal distribution? 

But the Beta(2,2) is a U-shaped distribution, not symmetric? Wait no, Beta(2,2) is symmetric around 0.5. It has a peak at the center. 

Wait, but its kurtosis is 3? Interesting. 

Wait, but in this case, the skewness is zero, so that would still correspond to the null hypothesis of normality? No, because Beta(2,2) is not a normal distribution, but it has the same skewness and kurtosis. 

However, the Jarque-Bera test only checks those two moments. So if the data is from a Beta(2,2), it would pass the JB test, even though it's not normal. 

Therefore, the JB test is not a perfect test for normality, since other distributions can have the same skewness and kurtosis. But the null hypothesis is still that the data comes from a distribution with those moments, not necessarily normal, right? 

Wait, actually, the JB test is specifically for normality, under the null that the data is normally distributed, which requires skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So even though other distributions can have those moments, the JB test is constructed to test the normality assumption. 

Therefore, the answer is B. 

Given all this, I think the user might have made a mistake in the answer key, or perhaps there was a typo in the question. The correct answer should be B. Unless there is some other test I'm not aware of, but given the information, I can't see how D would be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness? Like, the skewness divided by its standard error? But that's part of the test statistic, not the null hypothesis parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in another context, such as in a different parametrization where skewness is measured differently. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Bera-Jarque test for another distribution? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to excess kurtosis? So for example, if the question says "kurtosis of three", that would actually be excess kurtosis of 0. But if the options are written as "kurtosis of three", that would be correct. 

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the actual kurtosis (which is 3 for normal) and excess kurtosis (which is 0). So if the question is using "kurtosis" to refer to excess kurtosis, then the null would have zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis, so zero and zero. Which is option A. But that can't be. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing terms. If "kurtosis of three" is referring to the excess kurtosis, then that would be wrong. Because 3 would be a high excess kurtosis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled. 

Alternatively, the user might have seen a test question that was incorrect, and is now confused. 

Therefore, after all this thinking, I'm pretty confident the correct answer is B. So perhaps the user made an error, or there's a typo in the question. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to check the original source again. But given the information here, I can't see why D would be correct. 

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check the original question again. The user says the question is: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." The options are A-D. 

Wait, the wording is "the distribution has." So, under the null, the distribution must have what? Skewness and kurtosis as per the test's null. Since the test's null is that it's normal, which requires skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. 

Therefore, the answer must be B. 

Therefore, the user's assertion that the correct answer is D must be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a region or textbook that uses different terminology? For instance, in some contexts, skewness might be defined as the third moment divided by variance^(3/2), so for a normal distribution, it's zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sample skewness and kurtosis, but that still doesn't change the null hypothesis parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe in the Bera-Jarque test, they are testing for some other distribution? 

Alternatively, perhaps the test is for a different distribution where the null has skewness 1? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the parameters of a different statistical test, like the Box-Cox transformation or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, but I can't see how. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis statistics? For example, in the JB test, the skewness is divided by its standard error, so maybe the question is mixing them up. But no, the standard error is part of the test statistic formula, not the null hypothesis parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe "skewness of one" refers to the absolute value? But that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the standardized moments with the actual moments? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test's test statistic, not the parameters? Like, the test statistic has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and there was a mistranslation. 

Alternatively, the user might have seen a question where the JB test is applied to a different distribution, such as a Poisson distribution with lambda=1, which has mean 1, variance 1, skewness 1, and kurtosis 4. So if the null hypothesis is that the data comes from a Poisson distribution with lambda=1, then the skewness would be 1 and kurtosis 4. But that's not the JB test's usual null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, and the answer should be B, but the user is confused. 

Given all of this, I think the user might have made an error in stating the correct answer as D, and the actual correct answer should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the question is referring to the "Bera-Jarque" test as in a test of symmetry? Like testing if the skewness is one? But that seems odd. 

Alternatively, perhaps "Bera-Jarque" is a different test. Let me search my memory for a test called Bera-Jarque. 

Wait, maybe it's a variation or a misspelling? Maybe "Bera" is "Bera" as in a different statistician? Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the "Bera" test, but I can't recall. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo for "Bera" instead of "Jarque". Like "Bera-Jarque" is actually "Jarque-Bera", but reversed. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is named after someone else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is fabricated or from an incorrect source. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, the options are different, like C or D have different numbers, but as per the user's question, D is skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I made a mistake. Let me just re-verify the JB test null hypothesis. 

Yes, the null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which has skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 0. Therefore, the kurtosis (non-excess) is 3. So the correct answer is B. 

Therefore, unless the question is incorrect, the answer should be B. So the user might have a mistake in their question's answer key. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is B, and the user might have a typo, or the original question was incorrect. 

But the user is asking why the correct answer is D, so maybe there is a misunderstanding. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about the parameters of the test statistic's distribution? Like, under the null, the JB statistic is distributed as chi-square with 2 degrees of freedom, but that doesn't relate to skewness and kurtosis of the data. 

Alternatively, the JB test assumes that the data comes from a distribution with skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so the null hypothesis is exactly that. So the answer must be B. 

Therefore, after considering all possibilities, I think the user must have made an error in the correct answer. The correct answer should be B. 

But since the user is asking why D is the correct answer, perhaps they have a different context. Maybe the question is about a different test or a variation of the JB test. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the null hypothesis parameters but about the test statistic parameters. For example, the JB test statistic has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The parameters of the chi-square distribution are degrees of freedom, which are 2. But that is unrelated to the skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test, like the critical values? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook or exam where there was a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and I'm missing some essential point. 

Wait, maybe there's confusion between "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis". Let me think again. 

Skewness: Under the null (normal), skewness is 0. 

Kurtosis: The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. So if the question is referring to the actual kurtosis, then it is 3. If, however, the question is referring to the excess kurtosis (which is kurtosis - 3), then the null hypothesis would require excess kurtosis of 0. 

Therefore, if the question says "kurtosis of three", that's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should have skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, which is option B. 

Therefore, the user is mistaken in thinking the answer is D. 

Alternatively, maybe the options were presented in a different order, like D is B. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different version where "skewness of one" is correct, but I can't see why. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but about a test that assumes a different distribution, such as a Poisson distribution with lambda=1, which has skewness sqrt(1)=1 and kurtosis 3 + 1=4, but that still wouldn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the "excess kurtosis of three", which would be actual kurtosis of 6, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a different definition, where skewness is defined such that a symmetric distribution has a skewness of 1 instead of 0? But that would be non-standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using standardized variables? For example, in some cases, standardized skewness might be scaled differently. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the formula of the JB test again. Let me write it out. 

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is given by:

JB = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{1}{4}(K - 3)^2 \right )

where S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis (without subtracting 3), and n is the sample size. 

Under the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed, S should be 0, and K should be 3. Therefore, the null hypothesis requires skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3. Therefore, the answer is B. 

Therefore, I can't see any possible way that D would be correct. 

Perhaps the user is confusing it with another test, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but that's for comparing to any continuous distribution, not specifically skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, the question might be a trick question where "Bera-Jarque" is a different test. Maybe Bera is another statistician... Wait, perhaps it's the "Bera test" for something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Bera-Jarque test for a different distribution where the parameters are 1 and 3. But I can't think of such a test. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language. For example, in some languages, "Bera" could mean something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the parameters of the Jarque-Bera statistic rather than the data's parameters. The JB statistic doesn't have parameters like skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the parameters of the distribution that maximizes the Jarque-Bera statistic? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has an error, and the correct answer should be B but the key says D. 

In conclusion, after all these considerations, I think there must be a mistake in the question's provided answer. The correct answer for the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, which is option B. The user might have encountered a typo or an error in the source they're referring to. 

Alternatively, if the question was about a different test where the null hypothesis is skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, then the answer would be D, but such a test is unfamiliar to me, and given the context of the question mentioning Bera-Jarque, which I assume refers to the Jarque-Bera test, then B is correct. 

Therefore, the user might have been given incorrect information, or there's a mistake in the question's options. 

**Final Answer**
The correct answer is \boxed{B}.
</think>

The question pertains to the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test, which is used to test whether a sample data has the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. 

1. **Skewness**: The normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness is 0.
2. **Kurtosis**: The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. This is the actual kurtosis, not the excess kurtosis (which is 0 when subtracting 3).

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is calculated as:
\[
JB = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{1}{4}(K - 3)^2 \right)
\]
where \(S\) is the sample skewness and \(K\) is the sample kurtosis. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, implying \(S = 0\) (zero skewness) and \(K = 3\) (kurtosis of three).

The options provided are:
- **A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis**
- **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**
- **C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis**
- **D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three**

Under the null hypothesis, the correct parameters are zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

\boxed{B}
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is D for this Bera-Jarque test question. The question is about the null hypothesis of the Bera-Jarque test, which I think is the Jarque-Bera test. Maybe they mixed up the names? Anyway, the options are about skewness and kurtosis. Let me start by recalling what the Jarque-Bera test is for.

The Jarque-Bera test is a statistical test used to check whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The null hypothesis of this test is that the data is normally distributed. So, under the null hypothesis, the distribution should have the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution. 

Now, I remember that a normal distribution has a skewness of zero because it's symmetric. Skewness measures the asymmetry, so zero means it's perfectly symmetric. But what about kurtosis? Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution. The standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. Wait, but sometimes people talk about excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus 3. So, if someone refers to excess kurtosis, then the normal distribution has 0 excess kurtosis. But the question here just says kurtosis, so it should be 3.

Looking at the options:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis – Hmm, that would mean kurtosis of 0, but normal is 3, so that's wrong.

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three – This seems right if kurtosis is 3. Wait, but the options are labeled B and D. Let me check again.

Wait, the user says the correct answer is D, which is skewness of one and kurtosis of three. But that contradicts my understanding. Wait a second, maybe I got something wrong here. Let me think again.

Hold on, maybe I confused the terms. Let me verify the skewness and kurtosis for a normal distribution. Yes, skewness is indeed 0, and the kurtosis is 3. So under the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test, the distribution should have skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not D. But the user is saying the correct answer is D. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error. Let me check the formulas again. The Jarque-Bera test statistic is defined as: JB = (n/6) * (S² + (C²)/4), where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). Therefore, the test is checking if the skewness is 0 and the excess kurtosis is 0, which would imply a normal distribution. So the null hypothesis is that skewness is 0 and kurtosis (excess) is 0, which corresponds to a kurtosis of 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. So why does the user say D is correct?

Wait, maybe there's confusion in the question's wording. Let me read the question again: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." The options are A-D. The user claims the correct answer is D: skewness of one and kurtosis of three. That doesn't align with my knowledge. Unless maybe the question was miswritten, or perhaps there's some other test?

Alternatively, perhaps the test is not the Jarque-Bera but another test? Wait, the Bera-Jarque test is the same as Jarque-Bera, just reversed. Maybe the user wrote it incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe in some sources they define the test differently? Let me check the kurtosis again. 

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between Pearson's measure of kurtosis, which is defined as the fourth standardized moment, which for a normal distribution is 3. So, yes, that's correct. If the kurtosis is 3, then it's mesokurtic, like the normal distribution. So then the null hypothesis would require skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so B is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis? Because the alternative is that either skewness is not zero or kurtosis is not three. But the question is about the null. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and the options were mislabeled? Or perhaps I made a mistake? Wait, let me think again: if the null is normality, then skewness is zero and kurtosis is three. So answer B. 

But the user is telling me that the correct answer is D. So maybe I need to check if there's an alternative way to parameterize skewness? Wait, skewness is defined as the third standardized moment. The normal distribution's third moment is zero, so skewness is definitely zero. 

Is there any case where skewness is considered as 1? No, unless they are talking about standardized variable or something else. But skewness is a dimensionless quantity, unitless, and for normal distribution it's zero. 

Wait, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test, but another test? Like a test for a different distribution? For example, if the null hypothesis is that the distribution is logistic, which has a skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 4.2 (excess of 1.2). Or maybe a different distribution? 

Alternatively, if the question refers to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, in the Jarque-Bera test, the test statistic is a function of the sample skewness and the sample kurtosis. So under the null, those sample moments should be close to 0 and 3, respectively. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was miswritten, and the options are different? Let me see the options again:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

Hmm. Unless there is some misunderstanding in the question's wording. Maybe "has" refers to something else? Wait, the question says "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." So the distribution has the features listed in the options. 

Wait, maybe there's a confusion between skewness and standardized skewness? Wait, the Jarque-Bera test uses the skewness and kurtosis of the data, not standardized. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and the correct answer is B, but they think it's D. Alternatively, maybe the test is designed for a different distribution, like a uniform distribution? Let me check. For a uniform distribution, the skewness is 0, and the kurtosis is 1.8, so not matching. A Laplace distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 6. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, or the user is confused. Alternatively, perhaps the test is not the Jarque-Bera, but another test where the null has different parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to another type of test where the null is different. Wait, if under the null hypothesis the distribution is exponential or something else? Exponential has positive skewness, but that's not common. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is right, but my knowledge is wrong. Wait, is there any chance that the Jarque-Bera test assumes a different null? Let me check quickly. 

Looking up Jarque-Bera test: The JB test is a goodness-of-fit measure of departure from normality. The test statistic is based on the skewness and kurtosis, and the null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which requires skewness = 0 and excess kurtosis = 0 (so kurtosis = 3). Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the question or the options. The user says the correct answer is D, but according to standard definitions, it should be B. Maybe the question had a mistake in the options? Let me check the options again. 

Wait, maybe the options are mislabeled in the question? If D is the correct answer, that implies that skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3. That would mean the distribution has a skewness of 1, which is not normal. So, perhaps the question is wrong? Or maybe the test is different. Alternatively, perhaps the test is for a different distribution where skewness is 1? 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Like, when they say "skewness of one", maybe they mean the standardized skewness, but I don't think so. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the test statistic rather than the distribution's parameters? But the question says "the distribution has ...", so it's about the distribution's parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused between the Jarque-Bera test and another test, like the D'Agostino-Pearson test? That also tests skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test is defined with different parameters? Let me check the formula again. 

The JB statistic is: JB = (n - k - 1)/6 * [S² + ( (K - 3)^2 ) /4], where n is the sample size, k is the number of regressors (in a regression context, but in general maybe k=0?), S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis. So the test is testing whether S = 0 and K = 3. So the null is exactly that. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. So the user might have made a mistake in the question or the options. Alternatively, maybe the original question had different options where D was B? 

Wait, maybe the user made a typo, and the options were different. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that sometimes kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis, so if the question says "kurtosis of 3", that would actually be excess kurtosis of 0, but then the answer would need to say kurtosis of 0. Wait, but if the question is written as "kurtosis of three", that would mean the actual kurtosis is 3, which for normal is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, they define skewness as (mean - mode)/std, which for normal is zero, but maybe in another way? Not that I know of. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test's statistic values? Like the JB statistic under the null hypothesis? But that statistic has a chi-squared distribution, not the parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is from a different country where definitions are different? I can't think of any. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is named something else here? Like "Bera-Jarque" instead of Jarque-Bera? That could be just a name reversal, but the test is the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually about the alternative hypothesis? If the alternative is some specific distribution, but the question says null. 

Hmm, given all this, I think the correct answer should be B, not D. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the options provided, or the user is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read again: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has..." so the distribution must have the parameters specified. Since the null is normality, it must have zero skewness and kurtosis 3, so B. 

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is B, but the user states it's D. Maybe they made a mistake in the question's options? For instance, if the options are mislabeled, or maybe they confused skewness with kurtosis? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test where the null is a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? For example, maybe a Poisson distribution? Let me check Poisson: skewness is 1/sqrt(lambda), and kurtosis is 3 + 1/lambda. If lambda is 1, then skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 4. But that's not 3. 

Alternatively, an exponential distribution: skewness is 2, kurtosis is 6. 

Alternatively, a log-normal distribution? Skewness is high, not 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different distribution like the triangular distribution? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about standardized skewness and kurtosis, but even then, the parameters would still be 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the sample statistics under the null, but they would still need to be close to 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in error, and the correct answer is B, but the user is referring to a different version. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question. Let me think if there's any case where the Jarque-Bera test assumes a different null. 

Wait, no. The Jarque-Bera is specifically designed to test for normality, so its null is that the distribution is normal. 

Therefore, I think the user might have made an error in stating that the correct answer is D. Unless, perhaps, in the original question, the options were different. Alternatively, maybe the question was in another context where the null is different, but I can't see how. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different type of skewness? For example, in some sources, is there a different definition? Let me check. 

According to standard definitions, skewness is the third standardized moment, so for normal distribution, it's zero. Kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment, which for normal is 3. 

Therefore, I'm pretty confident that B is correct, and there must be an error in the question or the user's assertion. Unless there's some other nuance I'm missing. 

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the test's critical values or something else? No, the question is about the distribution under the null. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original test is for a different null hypothesis? Like testing for a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But that's not standard. 

Hmm, maybe the user is referring to a typo where "one" should be "zero", so B is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the options were presented incorrectly. If the user says D is correct, but in the options given here, D is "Skewness of one and kurtosis of three," then maybe the correct answer is B. 

Perhaps I should point out the discrepancy and explain that based on standard definitions, B is correct, but there might be a typo or confusion in the question's options. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing Jarque-Bera with another test where the null is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, but I'm missing something. Let me think again. 

Wait, is there a case where the skewness is 1? Suppose a distribution has skewness 1. That would mean it's skewed to the right. But the null of Jarque-Bera is normality, which requires zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the standardized skewness statistic? For instance, the test statistic for skewness is (skewness)/se, where se is the standard error. But under the null, that should be zero. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up 'excess kurtosis'? If the question states "kurtosis of three," but if they were referring to excess kurtosis, then they would need excess kurtosis of 0, which would correspond to a kurtosis (non-excess) of 3. But the wording is just 'kurtosis', so it should be 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that uses a different convention where kurtosis is defined as excess kurtosis? In that case, "kurtosis of three" would mean excess kurtosis of 3, which is not normal. But that's non-standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is designed to test for another distribution with different parameters, like the Laplace distribution, but that usually has zero skewness and kurtosis of 6. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic? The JB statistic is supposed to be chi-squared distributed with two degrees of freedom under the null, but the parameters of the distribution (skewness and kurtosis) are the ones specified in the null. 

Therefore, unless there is some other trick or misunderstanding, I think the correct answer is B. However, since the user is confident it's D, maybe there's confusion between skewness and another moment. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the alternative hypothesis? If the alternative is a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is not testing for normality but another distribution where the parameters are skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let me think if such a distribution exists. 

Suppose a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let's see: For a distribution to have kurtosis 3, it must have the same tails as the normal distribution. The skewness of 1 would mean it's skewed to the right. But why would that be a standard null hypothesis? It doesn't seem standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is misworded and the options are different. For example, if the options were:

A. Zero skewness and three kurtosis,

B. One skewness and three kurtosis,

then D would be B. But as given, it's labeled D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original question was in another language and got mistranslated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken because they think that kurtosis of three is excess, so the actual kurtosis would be 6? But no, excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, so if the question says kurtosis of three, that's the actual value. 

Given all that, I think the user might have an error in their question's answer key, and the correct answer should be B. But since the user is asking why D is correct, perhaps I need to consider another angle. 

Wait, let me check the spelling again: Bera-Jarque test. Maybe it's a different test? Maybe it's a typo for the Box-Jenkins test? But that's for time series. Or the Box-Pierce test? No, that's for autocorrelation. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling of the Berk-Jones test? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the Bera-Jarque test but a different test? I can't find any reference to such a test, but since Jarque-Bera is common, maybe it's just reversed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a test where the null hypothesis is that the distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that would be a specific alternative. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing the Bera-Jarque test with some other test. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, but in the options, D is the correct one because the test is for standardized skewness and kurtosis. Wait, if the skewness is standardized, maybe they mean (skewness)/ (standard error of skewness)? But under the null, that would be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different type of skewness measurement? For example, in some fields, they might define skewness differently? 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution, like the uniform distribution. Let me check the skewness and kurtosis of a uniform distribution. For a uniform distribution on [a,b], the skewness is 0, and the kurtosis is -1.2, which is 1.8 when calculated as the fourth moment. Wait, Pearson's kurtosis for uniform is 1.8, so excess kurtosis is -1.2. Not matching any of the options except maybe A or C. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a binomial distribution with p=0.5? Then the skewness is 0, and kurtosis is 3 - 6/n, so if n is large, kurtosis approaches 3, so for n approaching infinity, that would be like a normal distribution. But for finite n, it's different. 

Alternatively, maybe a Poisson distribution with λ=1, then skewness is 1, and kurtosis is 4, so skewness 1 and kurtosis 4. Not exactly matching D. 

Alternatively, if λ=0.25, then skewness is 1/(sqrt(0.25)) = 2, which is higher. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the distribution in question has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but why would that be the null of the Bera-Jarque test? That doesn't align with standard knowledge. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the sample skewness and kurtosis, not the population? But under the null, the population parameters must be 0 and 3, so the sample would be around those. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the Jarque-Bera test with another test, like the Shapiro-Wilk test? That also tests normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was intended to ask about the alternative hypothesis? If so, then maybe D is the alternative, but the question says null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted, like asking for which option is NOT the null? But the user says the correct answer is D. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding between "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis". If the question says kurtosis of three, but if excess kurtosis is three, then the actual kurtosis would be 6, so that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is designed for a different null where kurtosis is 3 and skewness is 1? But that's not standard for any test I know. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's options are miswritten. If D was supposed to be B, then that would make sense. 

Given that I can't find any standard test where the null is skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, I think the correct answer must be B, and there's either a mistake in the question's options or the user's answer key. 

Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question's options, and the correct answer is B. However, since the user is asking why D is correct, I should explain the standard knowledge and point out the discrepancy. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake? Wait, let me check once again. 

Skewness of normal distribution: 0. Correct. 

Kurtosis of normal distribution: 3. Correct (Pearson's measure). 

Therefore, under the null (normality), skewness is 0 and kurtosis 3. So answer B. 

Therefore, the answer D is incorrect. Unless the question is using a different definition where kurtosis is defined as excess kurtosis, so kurtosis of 0 would mean actual kurtosis 3. But the question says kurtosis of three, so if they were using excess, that would be wrong. 

Alternatively, if the options were:

A. Zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and excess kurtosis of three,

then B would be wrong. 

But in the given question, the options are with "kurtosis", not "excess kurtosis". 

Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer is B, and there is an error in the question's options or the user's assertion. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that defines kurtosis differently? For example, some sources define kurtosis as excess kurtosis, so that the normal distribution has kurtosis 0. But then the question's option B would say "zero kurtosis", but the question's option B says "kurtosis of three". 

Wait, if they define kurtosis as excess, then the correct answer would be zero skewness and zero kurtosis, which is option A. But that contradicts. 

Alternatively, if the question's option B says "zero skewness and a kurtosis of three", and they're using kurtosis as excess, then that would be wrong because excess is 0. 

So, perhaps there's confusion here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the old definition of kurtosis where it's the fourth moment divided by variance squared, minus 3, so that kurtosis is the excess. 

Wait, no, Pearson's original kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment: μ4/σ4, which for normal is 3. So that's the actual kurtosis. 

The excess kurtosis is Pearson's kurtosis minus 3, so that for normal it's 0. 

So, if the question is using "kurtosis" as excess, then the null would be zero skewness and zero kurtosis. So that would be option A. But the question's option A is "zero skewness and zero kurtosis", which would be correct only if kurtosis refers to excess. 

But if the question says "kurtosis", then without qualification, it's ambiguous. However, in most statistical contexts, when they say kurtosis, they mean Pearson's measure which includes the 3. 

Therefore, unless the question specifies "excess kurtosis", it's safer to assume the full kurtosis. 

Therefore, given all that, I think the correct answer is B. So I think the user might have made an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is not for normality but for another distribution where the null assumes skewness=1 and kurtosis=3? 

Wait, let me think of a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Suppose a distribution that is a bit skewed but with same tails as normal. For example, a mixture distribution? 

Suppose a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let me see: 

Skewness = 1, which is a moderate positive skew. 

Kurtosis = 3 (Pearson's), so same tails as normal. 

Is there a common distribution like that? Not that I know of. Maybe a log-normal with certain parameters? 

Wait, log-normal has skewness greater than 0. For example, if X is log-normal with parameters μ and σ, the skewness is exp(σ²)(exp(σ²)+2) - 3, and kurtosis is exp(4σ²) + 2exp(3σ²) + 3exp(2σ²) - 3. So setting that to 3 would require σ=0, which gives normality, but then skewness is 0. 

Alternatively, a Gamma distribution. For a Gamma distribution with shape k and scale θ, skewness is 2/sqrt(k). So to get skewness 1, set sqrt(k)=2, so k=4. The kurtosis is 6 + 3/k = 6 + 3/4 = 6.75. So that's higher than 3. 

Alternatively, a Beta distribution. Let's see Beta(a,b). Skewness is (2(b - a)sqrt(a + b + 1)) / sqrt(ab(a + b - 2)). 

To get skewness of 1, set parameters such that that equation is 1. But also, kurtosis is [6(a - b)^2(a + b + 1)] / [ab(a + b - 2)(a + b + 2)] + 3. 

This might be possible for some a and b, but it's getting too involved. 

But even if such a distribution exists, it's not a standard null hypothesis for a common test like Jarque-Bera. 

Therefore, I think the conclusion is that there's an error in the question, and the correct answer should be B. 

However, since the user is asking why D is correct, perhaps they have a different source or there's a specific context. Maybe in some applied fields, people use different definitions? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and "has" refers to the test statistic? For example, the test statistic has certain values, but the distribution's parameters are different. But the question specifically says "the distribution has", so it's about the distribution's parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the "sample" skewness and kurtosis, but under the null, the sample would be estimated to have those values, but that's the same as the population parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis, such that the standardized skewness is sqrt(b1), but that would be a different measure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user mixed up the Jarque-Bera test with the D'Agostino test, which also tests skewness and kurtosis? The D'Agostino-Pearson test combines skewness and kurtosis into a test for normality, same as Jarque-Bera. So the null is still normality. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a test for a different distribution, like the exponential distribution, but that has skewness 2 and kurtosis 6, which doesn't match. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and "Bera-Jarque" refers to a different test. 

In summary, based on standard statistical knowledge, the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test is that the distribution is normal, which requires skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 3. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The user's assertion that it's D might be due to a mistake in the question's options or a misunderstanding. 

Perhaps the original question had a different test in mind, or there was a misprint in the options where D was supposed to be B, or perhaps the skewness was meant to be 0 but written as 1. 

Given the information provided, I think the answer should be B, and there might be an error in the options or the question's source.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test should be **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Jarque-Bera Test**:  
   The test checks whether sample data have **skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution**, which is the null hypothesis. If the test fails to reject the null, the data is consistent with normality.

2. **Skewness and Kurtosis of a Normal Distribution**:  
   - **Skewness**: A normal distribution has **zero skewness** (symmetric).  
   - **Kurtosis**: The fourth standardized moment (Pearson's kurtosis) of a normal distribution is **3** (not 0). The "excess kurtosis" (kurtosis minus 3) is 0, but the question refers to kurtosis directly, not excess kurtosis.

3. **Analysis of the Options**:  
   - **A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. Normality requires kurtosis of 3, not 0.  
   - **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**: **Correct**. Matches the normal distribution's parameters.  
   - **C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis**: Incorrect. Confuses skewness/kurtosis values.  
   - **D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three**: Incorrect. Normality requires zero skewness, not one.

### Why the User Might Think the Answer is D:  
- Possible **typographical errors** in the question's options (e.g., "one" instead of "zero" for skewness).  
- Confusion between **excess kurtosis** (which is 0 for normal) and **kurtosis** (which is 3).  
- Misunderstanding of the test's null hypothesis (e.g., assuming it tests for a non-normal distribution).

### Conclusion:  
The **mathematically correct answer is B**, as the Jarque-Bera test null hypothesis assumes normality (zero skewness and kurtosis of three). The assertion that D is correct likely stems from an error in the question's options or a misinterpretation of statistical parameters.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about the Bera-Jarque test and its null hypothesis regarding the distribution's skewness and kurtosis. The options are A through D, and the correct answer is supposed to be D, which states skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Hmm, wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test to check if sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The null hypothesis for this test is that the data is normally distributed. Now, under the normal distribution, what are the skewness and kurtosis values?

Normal distribution has a skewness of 0 because it's symmetric. Kurtosis for a normal distribution is 3, but sometimes I've heard people refer to excess kurtosis, which would be 0, since kurtosis is measured as 3 plus the excess. Wait, so maybe there's a confusion here between the actual kurtosis and the excess kurtosis?

Let me confirm: the formula for the Jarque-Bera (JB) test statistic is (n/6)*(S^2 + (K - 3)^2 / 4), where S is the sample skewness and K is the sample kurtosis. The test is checking whether the skewness is 0 and the kurtosis is 3, which are the values for a normal distribution. So under the null hypothesis, the skewness should be 0 and kurtosis should be 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. But the user is saying the answer is D, which is skewness of one and kurtosis of three. That contradicts what I know.

Wait a second, maybe the question is worded differently? Let me check the question again. The user wrote: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three."

Hmm, so according to the standard JB test, the null is indeed zero skewness and kurtosis of three, so B is correct. But the user states that D is the correct answer, which suggests maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, could there be a translation error or a misstatement in the question?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to some modified version of the test where the null is different? But I don't recall any such version. Alternatively, maybe the user made an error in the options? Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is asking about the standardized skewness and kurtosis measures? For instance, in some statistical tests, the skewness is divided by its standard error, but that's usually under the alternative. The JB test specifically uses the skewness and kurtosis values directly. The test statistic is based on the squared of the skewness divided by its variance and the squared of (kurtosis minus 3) divided by its variance, but the null hypothesis is still about the parameters being zero and three.

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between Pearson's moment coefficients and some other measure? Let's see: the third moment skewness is indeed zero for the normal distribution, and the fourth moment kurtosis is 3, so the standard JB test uses these. Therefore, answer B is correct.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is D. Maybe the question was mistyped? Let me check the original question again:

"Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Why the correct answer is D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three?"

Hmm. Maybe there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording? Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different test? Or perhaps the Bera-Jarque is not the same as Jarque-Bera? Maybe a typo? Wait, I think it's supposed to be Jarque-Bera test. Maybe Bera-Jarque is just reversed, but same thing.

Alternatively, could there be a confusion between skewness and another statistic? Let me think again. The test statistic is JB = (n/6)*(S² + (C - 3)² / 4), where S is the sample skewness and C is the sample kurtosis. The null is that S=0 and C=3. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the distribution has zero skewness and kurtosis of 3, so B should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as the "distribution has" something else, but perhaps the user is confused between the test statistic's components and the null's parameters? Or maybe there's a mistake in the question's options?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? But in the JB test, the skewness is standardized in the test statistic, but the null still refers to the actual parameters. The test statistic's formula incorporates the variance of skewness and kurtosis, but the parameters under H0 are still 0 and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the Jarque-Bera test with another test? For instance, in some other tests like the D'Agostino-Pearson test, but I think they also use the same parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and excess kurtosis? Let me check: Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, so under the null, excess kurtosis is 0. If the question was about excess kurtosis, then the kurtosis part would be zero, but that would make the answer A, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps there is confusion between skewness and another measure. Wait, skewness of 1? That would mean the distribution is positively skewed, but the JB test's null is zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is mistyped, and the correct answer is B, but the user thinks it's D due to a confusion? Because D has skewness of one and kurtosis three. Is there any scenario where the null hypothesis would have skewness one? That doesn't align with Jarque-Bera, which is specifically for normality.

Alternatively, maybe the test in question is not Jarque-Bera but another test? For example, in some econometric tests, maybe there's a test with different nulls? Let me try to recall. Maybe the user confused it with a different test that has different parameters?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized moments? For instance, dividing by the variance to some power. But even then, skewness is scaled appropriately. Wait, no, skewness is already a standardized moment (divided by σ^3), so the actual value for normal is zero.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, the skewness is defined differently? For example, in some software, they might present skewness as a standardized measure, but the formula is usually standard.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about a different distribution under the null? For example, if the null was a different distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that would not be Jarque-Bera. The JB test specifically tests against the null of normality.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct answer is B. But the user is asking why the answer is D, so they must have encountered this somewhere and are confused. Let me see if there's any possible way D could be correct.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test, but another test where the null is different. For example, if the test is about whether the distribution is a certain type of distribution, like a logistic distribution or something else with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? Let me check what distributions have those parameters. The logistic distribution has a skewness of 0, so that's not it. A uniform distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 1.8, so no. The exponential distribution has positive skewness, but maybe not exactly 1. Let me check: Exponential distribution has mean 1/λ, variance 1/λ², skewness 2, and kurtosis 6. So that's not it either.

Alternatively, maybe the log-normal distribution? Wait, log-normal has skewness greater than zero, but it's more complex. For example, for a log-normal distribution with μ=0 and σ²=1, skewness is e^(3σ² + 3μ) - 3e^(σ² + μ) sqrt(e^(σ²) -1) + 2e^μ... Hmm, maybe not exactly 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different test where the null is a distribution with those parameters, but I can't think of such a common test. Alternatively, could there be a mistake in the problem's options?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is confusing kurtosis with excess kurtosis? So if the question was about "zero kurtosis" then they might have thought of excess kurtosis, but in that case, the answer B would still have kurtosis 3, which is the actual kurtosis with excess 0. If the question said "zero excess kurtosis," then kurtosis would be 3, so that's still B.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition where kurtosis is defined without the 3? Sometimes kurtosis is presented as excess kurtosis, so in that case, the normal distribution would have "kurtosis" of 0. But then, the JB test would be testing for zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis, so that would be option A. But that's not matching either.

Wait, let me confirm the definitions. Kurtosis can be defined in two ways: one is the Pearson's moment coefficient of kurtosis, which is E[(X-μ)^4]/σ^4, which is always at least 1, and for a normal distribution is 3. The other is excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus 3, so 0 for normal. The Jarque-Bera test uses the kurtosis as defined by Pearson's (so 3 for normal), and subtracts 3 in the calculation. So the test is designed to have the null hypothesis that skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3, so that's B. So unless the question is using a different definition where "kurtosis" refers to excess kurtosis, then the answer would be different. But I think the standard JB test uses the standard kurtosis measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where "Bera-Jarque" is actually a different test? But I don't think so. I think it's just a misspelling of Jarque-Bera.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has an error. Given that, if the user is told that the correct answer is D, which is 1 and 3, but according to my knowledge, that's incorrect. Unless there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording.

Wait, another angle: the JB test is for testing normality, but perhaps the question is asking about the standardized skewness and kurtosis in the formula? For example, the test statistic is based on (S / sqrt(6/n))² + ( (K-3) / sqrt(24/n) )², but the null is still S=0 and K=3. The standardization is part of the test statistic, but the parameters under H0 are still 0 and 3, so the answer should still be B.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "the distribution has" which refers to the test statistic's values? But the test statistic's components are (S squared and (K-3) squared), so that doesn't align with either.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mixing up the JB test with the Anderson-Darling test or Shapiro-Wilk, but those don't specifically test skewness and kurtosis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different kind of null hypothesis, such as symmetric around zero with variance 1, but that still would have skewness zero unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and "Bera-Jarque" is a mistranslation? For example, in some languages, the order might be reversed, but I think it's the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to standardized coefficients? For example, the skewness divided by its standard error is 1? But that's not the parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Since I can't find a scenario where D would be correct, and all sources indicate that the JB test's null is normality (0 skewness, 3 kurtosis), so B, I think the original question might have an error, or the user misread the options. Alternatively, there might be a typo in the options, like option B is written as "zero skewness and a kurtosis of 1" but mistyped as "three," or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking the opposite, like the alternative hypothesis? But that wouldn't make sense either.

Wait, let me check the test statistic formula again to be thorough. The JB test statistic is:

JB = (n / 6) * [S² + (K - 3)² / 4]

Under the null hypothesis, S = 0 and K = 3, so the test statistic should be zero. Therefore, the null hypothesis must be that skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3, so the correct answer is B. 

Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the original question's options or in the provided answer. Unless the question is referring to something else entirely. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different test where the null is different. But as per the information given, the Bera-Jarque (Jarque-Bera) test's null hypothesis is zero skewness and kurtosis of three, so the correct answer should be B. Hence, the user might have encountered an incorrect source stating the answer as D, or perhaps a misprint in the question options where D's numbers are mixed up. Alternatively, if D was supposed to have zero skewness and kurtosis of 3, but the skewness part was mistyped as 1 instead of 0, then that would make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the test statistic's components? For example, the test statistic includes S² and (K-3)², so if someone thought the test is checking whether these values equal 1? But that doesn't make sense because the test statistic combines them with coefficients.

Alternatively, in some contexts, maybe the skewness is standardized differently, like dividing by the cube of standard deviation, but that still gives zero for normal.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing the JB test with the Shapiro-Wilk test, but that doesn't involve skewness/kurtosis.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different distribution that's being tested, like a logistic distribution, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 4.2, so no. A Laplace distribution has excess kurtosis of 3, so total kurtosis of 6? Let me calculate:

For a Laplace distribution, kurtosis is 6, so excess is 3. So if the null was Laplace, then kurtosis would be 6, but again, that's not the JB test.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different type of null, like a Poisson distribution? Poisson has skewness sqrt(1/λ) and kurtosis 3 + 1/λ. But these depend on λ, so unless λ is set to make skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, which would require sqrt(1/λ)=1 => λ=1, then kurtosis would be 3 +1 =4, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, a binomial distribution with parameters p, n? For p=0.5 and n approaching infinity, it becomes normal, but in finite cases, skewness is 0 when p=0.5, kurtosis is 3 - 6/n. So again not matching.

Alternatively, an exponential distribution with skewness 2 and kurtosis 6, so not 1 and 3.

Alternatively, a triangular distribution? Not sure, but probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis? For example, if the skewness is divided by its standard error, then under the null, that would be zero, but the test statistic is based on the squared value. Similarly for kurtosis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness being 1 and standardized kurtosis being 3, but that would mean the test statistic is based on those values, but that doesn't align with JB.

Alternatively, maybe there is confusion between the sample statistics and the population parameters? For instance, maybe someone thought the sample skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3, but in reality, the JB test uses the sample stats to test against the population parameters of 0 and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the JB test but the Shapiro-Wilk test? But that doesn't involve skewness/kurtosis.

Wait, another thought: in some software or textbooks, maybe they define the JB test slightly differently? For example, using a different formula? Let me check the formula again. The standard formula is (n/6)*(S² + (K - 3)^2 /4). The critical values are asymptotic, relying on the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, hence S=0 and K=3. So that seems standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that defines the test with different constants? For instance, if instead of dividing by 6 and 4, they used different denominators, but that would change the test statistic's value, not the null hypothesis's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverting the null and alternative hypotheses? For example, if the null was the alternative, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized JB test statistic where the statistic under the null has some value? For example, if the test statistic is supposed to follow a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, so maybe the parameters are values that lead to the statistic being 1 or 3? But that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the critical values? Like, if the critical value is around 5.99 for 5% significance, but that's not related to skewness or kurtosis numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized z-scores for skewness and kurtosis? Like, the skewness divided by its standard error is a z-score. If under the null, the z-scores would be zero, but if someone thought they should be 1, that would be wrong. For example, the skewness z-score is S / sqrt(6/n), so under H0, that's 0. Similarly for kurtosis. If someone thought the z-scores are 1, which is not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they are talking about the Bera-Jarque test but in the context of another distribution where the null has those parameters. For instance, if the null hypothesis is that the data follows a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, but that would not be the standard JB test.

Alternatively, perhaps there is confusion between the Jarque-Bera test and another test by the same authors, but I don't recall such a thing.

Alternatively, maybe "Bera-Jarque" refers to a different test in a different language? For example, in some languages, the order of names is different, but that wouldn't affect the parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers in the options are swapped? Like, for D, it should be zero skewness and kurtosis of three, but mistyped as 1 and 3. Or perhaps the skewness part was mistyped. If the skewness was supposed to be 0, then D would be B, but mistyped.

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the standardized skewness and kurtosis where they are divided by their standard errors? For instance, if the skewness is 1 standard error away from zero, but that's an alternative hypothesis, not the null.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly thought that the test is for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's not the JB test.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, and the correct answer is B, but the user's material says D, so they are confused. In that case, explaining the correct answer is B, and D is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the alternative hypothesis, but that would not make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula where the JB test is defined with different parameters? Let me check another source. 

According to the Wikipedia article on Jarque-Bera test: "The test statistic JB is defined as JB=(n−2)(n+1)12⁢(S2+14⁢(K−3⁢)2)" but the formula can be written as (n/6)(S² + (K-3)^2 /4). The test statistic is always non-negative. Asymptotically, the test statistic JB has a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. 

The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed. Therefore, the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. So the correct answer is B. 

Therefore, unless the question is incorrectly presented, the answer should be B. However, the user says the correct answer is D, so perhaps there is a mistake in their question's options. Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test called "Bera-Jarque" which is different? Maybe the opposite order? But I can't find any references to a Bera-Jarque test that is different from Jarque-Bera. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? For example, in some contexts, skewness is reported as the standardized skewness (divided by its standard error), but under the null, that would be zero. Alternatively, if they are using different standardization, but I can't see how that would give 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to kurtosis as "tailedness" where 3 is the "excess" but that's not correct. Kurtosis itself is 3 for normal, excess is 0.

Alternatively, maybe they are using a different type of kurtosis like the Pearson's median skewness or something else? But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a test bank that had a typo, and the correct answer was intended to be B but marked as D. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-standard source where the test is defined differently. 

Given that I cannot find any statistical basis for D being correct, I think it's most likely that there is either a mistake in the question's options or the provided answer. The correct answer according to standard statistical knowledge is B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three.

However, since the user is asking why the correct answer is D, perhaps I need to consider if there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording. Maybe the question says "under the alternative hypothesis" instead of null? If it's the alternative, then technically, the alternative is any distribution not normal, but the question specifies the options, so D would still not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the required conditions for the test to be valid? Like, the test requires the data to have skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized JB statistic's components where skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3 are part of the formula? But the test statistic is constructed using those terms subtracted by their null values (skewness -0, kurtosis -3).

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the variance of the skewness or kurtosis? For example, the variance of skewness is 6/n, so sqrt(6/n) is the standard error. If someone thought the variance was 1, leading to standard error 1, but that's not directly related.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different statistical test, like the D'Agostino test, which also tests for normality using skewness and kurtosis, but even then, the null is still 0 and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where "the distribution has" refers to the distribution of the test statistic, which is chi-squared with two degrees of freedom under the null. The chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom has skewness sqrt(8) and kurtosis 3. But that's different. Chi-squared(2) is actually an exponential distribution, which has skewness 2 and kurtosis 6. Wait, let's see:

Chi-squared with ν degrees of freedom:

- Mean: ν

- Variance: 2ν

- Skewness: 2*sqrt(2/ν)

- Kurtosis: 3 + 12/ν

So for ν=2:

- Skewness: 2*sqrt(2/2) = 2*1 = 2

- Kurtosis: 3 + 12/2 = 3 +6 = 9

So that doesn't give 1 and 3. If ν=3:

- Skewness = 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547

- Kurtosis = 3 + 12/3 = 7

Still not 1 and 3. For ν=4:

Skewness = 2/sqrt(4)=1

Kurtosis=3 + 12/4=6

Ah! Here, when ν=4, skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 6. So if the test statistic's distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 6. But the JB test statistic is chi-squared with 2 df, so that's not the case.

Wait, the JB test statistic is asymptotically chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom, so skewness is 2*sqrt(2/2)=2, kurtosis 3 +12/2=9.

So the test statistic's distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9 under the null. That's even further from D's 1 and 3.

Hmm. The only scenario I can think of where a distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3 is a specific distribution. Let me think of a distribution with those parameters.

Suppose a distribution that is symmetric (so skewness 0?), but maybe a distribution skewed to the right with skewness 1, but kurtosis 3 (same as normal). For example, a mixture of normals or some other distribution.

Alternatively, maybe a uniform distribution? Wait, uniform has skewness 0 and kurtosis 1.8.

Alternatively, a beta distribution? Let's see, for a symmetric beta distribution, like Beta(2,2), which has mean 0.5, variance 1/18, skewness 0, kurtosis 1.875. Not 1 and 3.

A beta distribution with parameters α=β=1.5 would have skewness 0 and kurtosis higher?

Alternatively, a triangular distribution? The triangular distribution on [0,1] with mode at 0.5 is symmetric, so skewness 0. If the mode is shifted, say mode at 0.25, maybe it has skewness 1?

The skewness of triangular distribution is given by sqrt(2)/sqrt(5). Not sure.

Alternatively, a custom distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Let's see, suppose a distribution where the third moment is sqrt(variance^3)*1 and the fourth moment is 3*variance^2. That could be possible, but there is no standard distribution with those parameters. 

However, the key point is that the Jarque-Bera test is testing against the null of normality, which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. So unless the question is using a different null hypothesis, D is incorrect.

In conclusion, the user might have encountered an incorrect question or there's a typo. The correct answer should be B. However, if the question indeed states the answer is D, then there must be an error in the question's options or explanation.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test is **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not D. Here's the detailed reasoning:

### Key Points:
1. **Jarque-Bera (JB) Test Purpose**:  
   The JB test is a statistical test to determine if a sample dataset has **skewness** and **kurtosis** matching those of a normal distribution. The **null hypothesis** states that the data is normally distributed.

2. **Normal Distribution Properties**:  
   - **Skewness**: A normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness is **0**.  
   - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis of a normal distribution is **3** (often called "mesokurtic"). Excess kurtosis (kurtosis minus 3) is **0** for a normal distribution.

3. **JB Test Statistic**:  
   The JB test statistic is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{JB} = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{(K - 3)^2}{4} \right)
   \]  
   where \(S\) is the sample skewness and \(K\) is the sample kurtosis. Under the **null hypothesis**, \(S = 0\) and \(K = 3\), resulting in a JB statistic of **0**.  

4. **Why Option D is Incorrect**:  
   - **Skewness of 1 and Kurtosis of 3** is not a characteristic of a normal distribution.  
   - A skewness of 1 implies positive skewness (asymmetry to the right), contradicting the null hypothesis of symmetry (0 skewness).  
   - While the kurtosis value of 3 aligns with the normal distribution, the skewness component here is incorrect.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, which specifies **zero skewness** and **kurtosis of three** (the parameters of the normal distribution). Option D likely arose from a misinterpretation of skewness or a typo in the question. If your material states otherwise, it may contain an error.  

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{B}
[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the Bera-Jarque test's null hypothesis. I remember that the Jarque-Bera test is used to check if a sample's data has the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. But wait, what exactly are the parameters of the normal distribution regarding skewness and kurtosis?

First, skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution. A normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness should be zero, right? So that part might not be the answer. Then kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution. The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3, but sometimes people talk about excess kurtosis, which would be 0 when subtracting 3. Hmm, maybe that's where confusion comes in.

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is based on these two measures. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which would mean the skewness is 0 and the kurtosis is 3. Wait, so under the null, the skewness should be 0 and kurtosis 3. Let me check the options again. 

Option A says zero skewness and zero kurtosis. That can't be right because kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3. Option B says zero skewness and kurtosis of 3. That seems correct, but the question says the correct answer is D, which is skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Hold on, maybe I got confused between skewness and another measure. Let me think again. The skewness for a normal distribution is indeed 0. Kurtosis is 3, but sometimes it's reported as excess kurtosis (kurtosis minus 3), so excess kurtosis is 0 for normal. However, the Jarque-Bera test uses the actual kurtosis, not the excess. The test statistic is (n/6)*(skewness² + (kurtosis - 3)^2). Wait, actually, the formula might involve the excess kurtosis. Let me recall the formula for the Jarque-Bera test.

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is given by:

JB = (n / 6) * (S² + (K - 3)^2 / 4)

where S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis, and n is the sample size.

Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the expected skewness is 0 and the expected kurtosis is 3. So the null hypothesis is that the data has a normal distribution, which implies skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. That contradicts what I remember. Maybe there's a typo in the question or in the options? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the Bera-Jarque test with something else. Let me confirm: the Jarque-Bera test is definitely for normality based on skewness and kurtosis. So under H0, skewness=0 and kurtosis=3. Hence, option B should be correct. But the user insists the correct answer is D. That's confusing. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? Or maybe the user mixed up names? Alternatively, maybe in some sources, they define kurtosis differently. Let me see: sometimes kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis, so for normal distribution, it's 0. But the actual kurtosis is 3. So if the question is referring to excess kurtosis, then the null would be zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis. But that would be option A. Hmm, but that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong. Let me see. The user's options are:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

If the correct answer is D, that suggests skewness of one? That's not normal. Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, perhaps the test is not for normality but something else? Or maybe the user made an error in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, the Jarque-Bera test uses the actual sample skewness and kurtosis. The test is set up so that under normality, skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where they refer to the standardized versions? Wait, the formula uses (skewness)^2 and (kurtosis - 3)^2, so if the null is skewness=0 and kurtosis=3. So the answer must be B. Maybe the user is mistaken in thinking the answer is D? Alternatively, maybe the question is stated incorrectly. Let me check the question again:

"Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three."

Hmm, unless there's a language error here. Maybe "Bera-Jarque" is a typo for "Jarque-Bera"? If so, then the correct answer is B. But if the test is something else... Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis. Wait, perhaps in the test statistic, you have terms that are standardized, so the expected value under null is different? Let me think again about the formula.

The JB test statistic is approximately chi-squared distributed with 2 degrees of freedom. The components are the skewness and the excess kurtosis. The test is designed such that under the null of normality, the expected values are 0 for skewness and 0 for excess kurtosis (since excess kurtosis is kurtosis - 3). Wait, so maybe the question is using the excess kurtosis? If so, then under the null, skewness is zero and excess kurtosis is zero, so total kurtosis would be 3. But then the question's options have "kurtosis of three" which would correspond to that. So the answer B is still correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly worded, and the person who set it thought that skewness should be 1? That would be odd because normal distribution has symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, the skewness is defined differently? Wait, no. The standard skewness is 3*(mean - mode)/standard deviation, so for symmetric distributions, that's zero.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness? Like, the skewness divided by its standard error? But then the expected value would still be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the beta skewness parameter in some distribution? Wait, like in the beta distribution? But that seems unrelated to Jarque-Bera.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where they define skewness differently, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing with another test. For example, the Shapiro-Wilk test is also for normality, but it's different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the correct answer should be B but the user says it's D. Hmm. Let me check online quickly (theoretically, since I can't actually browse, but maybe recall). The Jarque Bera test's null is that the data is normally distributed, which implies skewness 0, kurtosis 3. So answer B. So unless the test is different, like maybe the Bera-Jarque test is different? Wait, maybe it's a translation error? "Bera-Jarque" instead of "Jarque-Bera"? No, the test is usually Jarque-Bera. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct but the options are mislabeled? For instance, maybe the user actually meant that the correct answer is B but mistyped D. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that has a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the standardized skewness or something else. Wait, perhaps the formula uses the squared skewness divided by 6 or something, but under the null, the expected value is 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the test's null but about something else. Wait, the question says "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has..." So it's about the distribution's parameters under the null. So if the test is for normality, then yes, it should be 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution. Wait, if the test was for uniform distribution, then the skewness and kurtosis would be different. For a uniform distribution, the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is -1.2, which is lower than normal. 

Alternatively, if it were a logistic distribution, the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 4.2, but that's not 3. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic's distribution under the null? No, that wouldn't be skewness and kurtosis of the data, but of the test statistic, which is chi-square, so skewness is 2*sqrt(2)/sqrt(n) and kurtosis 3 + 12/n or something, but that's different. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different hypothesis. Wait, the Jarque-Bera test's null is that the data is normally distributed, so it's about the data's distribution parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Let me think again:

If the answer is D (skewness 1 and kurtosis 3), that would mean under the null, the skewness is 1? That would not be normal. So perhaps the test is not for normality but another distribution where the null has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Which distribution has that? Let me think: A Poisson distribution has skewness sqrt(λ) and kurtosis 3 + 1/λ. If λ=1, then skewness is 1, kurtosis is 4, so that's not 3. 

A log-normal distribution can have skewness greater than 0. For example, a log-normal with μ=0 and σ=1 has skewness e^(3σ² + 3e^(σ²)) / (e^(σ²))^1.5 which is definitely more than 1. Maybe a different distribution? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is entirely wrong. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is D, but according to my knowledge it should be B, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question? Maybe the test is not Jarque-Bera but another one. For example, the normal distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so if the question is referring to another test's null hypothesis, like for a t-test, but that doesn't involve skewness or kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted. If the test rejects when there is skewness or kurtosis different from the null, so the null is that the distribution is not normal? But no, that's the opposite. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the JB test with another test where the null is different. Hmm. Alternatively, let's think of another approach: maybe the JB test statistic is calculated as (n/6)(s^2 + (k - 3)^2), so under the null, the expected value would be 0 for skewness and 3 for kurtosis, hence the null is those parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and the answer is D because of some misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps in some definitions, the skewness is defined as (mean - mode)/sd, but if the distribution is symmetric but has a different parameter, like in some parametric distributions, but generally, skewness is 0 for normal. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, "Bera-Jarque" refers to a different test? Maybe a test for another distribution? 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of standardized moments, so the skewness is divided by some value. Wait, standardized skewness is the third standardized moment, which is skewness/(sd^(3)), but for normal distribution, that's still 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to beta coefficients in a regression? No, that's unrelated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a transformed variable. For instance, if the test is applied to residuals of a model, but the null is still about the distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the user copied the question wrong. Like, maybe the options were misnumbered. For example, maybe the intended answer is B but labeled as D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct but I need to think differently. Wait, maybe "skewness of one" is not the same as the standard definition. For example, in some contexts, people might define skewness as the third moment divided by variance^1.5 plus 1 or something? That would be non-standard. But I don't recall any standard where skewness of normal is 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the shape parameters of a distribution family. For example, in a beta distribution with parameters (2,2) has skewness 0 and kurtosis 1.8, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the test statistic is calculated differently. Let me recall the Jarque-Bera test formula again. 

The JB test is a goodness-of-fit measure of departure from normality based on the sample skewness and sample kurtosis. The test statistic is:

JB = (n / 6) * (S² + (K - 3)^2 / 4)

Under the null hypothesis of normality, S (sample skewness) should be approximately 0, and K (sample kurtosis) should be approximately 3. The test statistic is then approximately chi-squared distributed with 2 degrees of freedom. This formula comes from the Central Limit Theorem, where the skewness and kurtosis estimators converge to their true values (0 and 3) under the null.

Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the data has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so option B is correct. 

Therefore, unless there is a mistake in the question's wording or options, the user might have provided incorrect information, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. The correct answer should be B. 

But given that the user says it's D, maybe I need to think again. Let me check the question once more: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." So the null hypothesis states that the distribution has which properties? 

If the answer were D (skewness 1 and kurtosis 3), that would mean that the test assumes the distribution has a skewness of 1. But that's not the case for the Jarque-Bera test. The JB test does not assume any specific skewness or kurtosis other than those of the normal distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe in the question, there's a translation error from another language. For example, in some languages, the words for skewness and something else might be confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic's own distribution, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is not for normality but for a different distribution where the null requires skewness=1 and kurtosis=3. But I can't think of such a distribution. 

Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the options. If the options are mislabeled, like maybe D is supposed to be the correct answer, but the actual JB test's null is B, so maybe the user has the options wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and there is a misunderstanding in the standard values. Wait, another thought: sometimes kurtosis is presented as excess kurtosis, so the question might have said kurtosis of three, but if excess kurtosis is zero, then the actual kurtosis would be 3. So if someone confuses the terms, they might say "kurtosis of three" meaning excess kurtosis (which is zero). But no, that still doesn't get to skewness of one. 

Wait, let me think of all distributions with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. Is there such a distribution? Let me think of a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=0.5. That would be symmetric (skewness 0) and kurtosis 1.5. No. A log-normal with certain parameters? Let me recall, log-normal skewness is (e^{σ²} + 2) sqrt(e^{σ²} -1). If σ is small, say σ=1, then e^{1} ≈2.718, so skewness is (2.718 +2)*sqrt(2.718 -1) ≈4.718 * 1.31 ≈6.17, which is way over 1. 

A Poisson distribution with λ=1 has variance=1, so skewness=1/sqrt(1)=1, and kurtosis=3 + 1/λ=4. So that's skewness 1 and kurtosis 4. Close but not exactly. 

Another distribution: the exponential distribution has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9. So not that. 

Wait, if someone takes a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, maybe a specific parametrization. Let me think of a gamma distribution. A gamma distribution with shape α and scale β has skewness 2/sqrt(α), and kurtosis 3 + 6/α. 

Suppose skewness of 1 would require 2/sqrt(α)=1 => sqrt(α)=2 => α=4. Then kurtosis would be 3 + 6/4 = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. So that's not 3. 

Alternatively, to get kurtosis 3, we need 3 + 6/α =3 => 6/α=0 => α→infinity, which would make the distribution approach a normal distribution, but then skewness would go to zero. 

Hmm. There's no standard distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe a triangular distribution? The triangular distribution has parameters. Let me think: if it's symmetric around the mode, then skewness is 0. If it's left or right skewed, maybe. Let me check the formulas. For a triangular distribution on [a, b] with mode at c, the skewness is (a + b - 2c)/ (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - a b - 2 a c - 2 b c + 3 c^2)/2 )) * sqrt(3). It's getting too complicated. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe a custom distribution made by someone for the test. The question doesn't specify, so I think that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and the correct answer should be B. But the user's question states that the correct answer is D. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in recalling the JB test. Let me check the formula once again:

The Jarque-Bera test statistic: JB = (n / 6) * (S² + (K - 3)^2 / 4), where S is sample skewness, K is sample kurtosis. Under the null of normality, S approaches 0 and K approaches 3. 

Thus, the correct answer is B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. 

Therefore, unless there is some other consideration I'm missing, it seems that the user might have an error in the question's options or the correct answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is inverting the null and alternative hypotheses? For instance, maybe the test's alternative is B, so the null is the opposite? No, the null is what the test assumes. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the standardized skewness, such that the test statistic uses skewness divided by its standard error, so the expected value is zero, but the standard deviation is 1? For example, the JB statistic uses the skewness standardized by its variance. The asymptotic variance of skewness is 6/n, so the standardized skewness would be S / sqrt(6/n). But the JB test statistic combines them in such a way that under the null, they both go to zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis, but even then, their expected values under the null would be zero and zero (for excess kurtosis) or zero and three? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the parameters of the Bera-Jarque test itself, like the critical values or something else, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-standard source where the test is defined differently. 

Given all this, I think there's a mistake in the question or the provided correct answer. The correct answer for the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis should be B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Therefore, unless there's some context or definition I'm missing, I believe the user might have an error in the question's options or the correct answer. 

However, since the user is insistent that the correct answer is D, I might have to consider if I misunderstood the question. Maybe "Bera-Jarque" is a different test? Let me think of any other test with a similar name. 

Ah! Wait a second, perhaps it's the "Bera-Jarque" test as opposed to "Jarque-Bera"? Maybe that's a typo, but the test is the same. The order of names is irrelevant. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a different statistic proposed by them. Alternatively, maybe it's a different test altogether. For instance, if it's a test for another distribution where the null requires skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, but I can't recall such a test. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis, but even so, I can't see how that would result in 1 and 3. 

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding between the population parameters and the sample statistics? The Jarque-Bera test uses sample moments, so the null is that the population has 0 skewness and 3 kurtosis, so the answer should still be B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the parameters of the test statistic. For example, the JB statistic has two components: the skewness squared and the (kurtosis-3)^2. Maybe someone thought the expected values are 1 and 3 for those terms, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a confusion between variance and kurtosis. Wait, variance is the second moment, kurtosis is the fourth. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's options are mislabeled. For instance, maybe option D was supposed to be the test's alternative hypothesis rather than the null? 

Alternatively, maybe the test is designed to test against a specific alternative with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, making the null different. But that's speculative. 

In conclusion, based on my knowledge of the Jarque-Bera test, the correct answer should be B. Therefore, either the question has an error, or there's a misunderstanding. If the user insists that D is correct, perhaps there's a different context or a version of the test I'm not aware of. But given the standard definition, I believe B is correct. 

Wait, hold on! Wait a moment! Maybe I confused kurtosis with excess kurtosis in the question. Let me check: The formula for JB test uses (kurtosis - 3), which is the excess kurtosis. So if the question is referring to excess kurtosis, then under the null, excess kurtosis is 0, so the actual kurtosis is 3. Therefore, the question might have mixed up terms. 

But the options mention "kurtosis of three", which would be the actual kurtosis. If the question's answer D was "Skewness of one and excess kurtosis of three", then it would be wrong. But since the options are as stated, maybe the question is correct and the test is testing a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bera-Jarque test is for a different distribution. Let me search my memory for any such test. I can't recall a Bera-Jarque test other than Jarque-Bera. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is named after different people? Not that I know. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another statistical test where the null hypothesis has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. If such a test exists, but I don't know of it. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and I have to consider that the user might have a different definition. Let me think of the formula again. If the JB test's statistic is JB = (n/6)(S² + (K - 3)^2), then the null is S=0, K=3. So answer B. 

Therefore, I think the user might have provided incorrect information. The correct answer should be B. 

Perhaps the user confused skewness with another parameter. For example, in a binomial distribution with p=0.5, the skewness is 0, but if p= something else, but that's not relevant here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question's options are swapped. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Anderson-Darling test, but that also doesn't involve skewness and kurtosis. 

Alternatively, the answer D might be correct in another context. For example, if the distribution is supposed to have skewness 1 and kurtosis 3, then the test is testing against that null. But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized moments. Let's think differently: the skewness is the third standardized moment, which for a normal variable is 0. The fourth standardized moment is kurtosis, which is 3 for a normal distribution. Therefore, under the null of normality, the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. 

Alternatively, if the question is referring to a different parametrization, like "excess skewness" which is skewness minus something, but I don't know such a term. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer is B. 

Given that I can't find any other justification for answer D, I think the correct answer under the Jarque-Bera test's null hypothesis is B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Therefore, the user might have made an error in the question's options or the answer provided. Unless there's a different test called Bera-Jarque with different null parameters, but I can't confirm that. 

Perhaps the user is thinking of the test's test statistic's expected value? For example, the JB statistic itself has an expected value under the null. But the JB statistic's expected value would be approaching 0 as n increases, since the skewness and kurtosis go to their true values. 

Alternatively, the variance of the JB statistic? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the distribution of the test statistic under the null, which is a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The skewness of a chi-squared distribution with ν degrees of freedom is sqrt(8/ν), so for ν=2, that would be sqrt(4)=2. The kurtosis is 3 + 12/ν, so for ν=2, that's 3 + 6 =9. So that's not matching either. 

Alternatively, the question might have mixed up the parameters of the test's statistic distribution with the distribution being tested. 

In summary, after careful consideration and checking the definitions, I believe the correct answer should be B. The user might have a mistake in their question or the provided correct answer. However, since the user is asking why the correct answer is D, there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the question's phrasing or options.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the null hypothesis of a Jarque-Bera test should be **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not D. Here's the detailed explanation:

### Key Points:
1. **Jarque-Bera Test Purpose**:  
   The Jarque-Bera test checks whether sample data is consistent with a normal distribution by assessing its **skewness** and **kurtosis**.

2. **Null Hypothesis**:
   - Under the null hypothesis, the test assumes the data follows a **normal distribution**.
   - A normal distribution has:
     - **Zero skewness** (symmetrical distribution).
     - **Kurtosis of 3** (mesokurtic shape).

3. **Why Option B is Correct**:
   - The skewness of a normal distribution is **0**.
   - The kurtosis of a normal distribution is **3** (not 0; "excess kurtosis" is 0, but the question refers to raw kurtosis).

4. **Why Option D (Skewness of 1 and Kurtosis of 3) is Incorrect**:
   - A normal distribution explicitly has **zero skewness**, not 1. A skewness of 1 would indicate a right-skewed distribution, which contradicts the normality assumption.
   - There is no standard statistical test named "Bera-Jarque" (if miswritten as "Jarque-Bera") that assumes a non-normal distribution (e.g., skewness ≠ 0) as its null hypothesis.

### Conclusion:
The confusion might arise from misremembering excess kurtosis (which is 0 for normality) or mixing up statistical terms. However, based on the Jarque-Bera test's standard formulation, the correct answer is **B**. The provided answer (D) likely contains an error in the question or options.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{B}
[overthinking]
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out why the correct answer to the Bera-Jarque test question is option D, which states that under the null hypothesis, the distribution has a skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Hmm, first, I should recall what the Bera-Jarque test is about. I remember it's a test for normality, right? It checks whether the data has skewness and kurtosis that matches a normal distribution. 

Wait, the null hypothesis in such tests usually states that the data follows a specific distribution—in this case, the normal distribution. So under the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test, the data should be normally distributed. Therefore, the skewness and kurtosis under the null should be the values expected for a normal distribution. 

But hold on, what are the skewness and kurtosis values for a normal distribution? Let me think. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution. A normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness should be zero. But wait, the options don't have zero skewness and three kurtosis as one of them? Let me check the options again. The options are A: zero for both, B: zero skew and three kurtosis, C: one skew and zero kurtosis, D: one skew and three kurtosis. Wait, but if the question is correct, then the answer D is supposed to be right. But this contradicts my prior knowledge. Maybe I mixed up something?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing excess kurtosis. The standard kurtosis for a normal distribution is three, but sometimes people report excess kurtosis, which would be zero. So maybe the test uses the actual kurtosis (3) instead of the excess (0). Similarly, skewness is always zero for a normal distribution. 

So if the question is about the Jarque-Bera test, let me double-check its null hypothesis. The Jarque-Bera test statistic is based on the sample skewness and sample kurtosis. The test statistic is defined as: JB = (n/6) * (S^2 + (K - 3)^2 / 4), where S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis, and n is the number of observations. 

Wait, so the formula uses (K - 3)^2 divided by 4, which suggests that under the null hypothesis, the expected kurtosis is 3. Because if the kurtosis is 3, then K-3 would be zero. Similarly, the skewness under null is zero because the term S² is part of the test statistic, so when S is zero, that term disappears. 

Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, the skewness should be 0 and the kurtosis should be 3, right? But that corresponds to option B. But the user says the correct answer is D. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion in the way skewness and kurtosis are defined here. Maybe in some definitions, the skewness is standardized differently? Wait, standard skewness is the third standardized moment, which for normal distribution is indeed zero. Kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment, which is 3 for a normal distribution. Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, so excess is zero. 

So under the null hypothesis of normal distribution, skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3. So that would mean option B is correct. But the user is saying the correct answer is D. Hmm, maybe the user is mistaken, or maybe the question is worded differently?

Wait, let me read the question again: "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has." The options are A to D. The user says the correct answer is D. Maybe there's a typo in the options? Or perhaps the question is different?

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the test's formulation? Wait, maybe the test is not for normality? No, I thought Jarque-Bera is for normality. Wait, let me confirm. Yes, the Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test of whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The test statistic is based on the difference between the sample skewness and 0 and the sample kurtosis and 3. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, which implies skewness 0 and kurtosis 3, so option B. But the user says the correct answer is D. That's conflicting. Maybe the question is from a source that has an error? Or perhaps the user mistyped the options?

Looking at the options again: Option D says "Skewness of one and kurtosis of three." But why would the skewness be one? Maybe they are using a different parameterization? Or perhaps they are talking about the standardized skewness? Wait, no, standard skewness is zero for normal. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the question? Alternatively, maybe there is confusion between skewness and another parameter?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the original question had a typo and the options are mislabeled? For instance, maybe the user intended to type different numbers but got confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a standardized version? Wait, no. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the standard Jarque-Bera test but a different version? Wait, perhaps the Bera-Jarque test is the same as Jarque-Bera? Yes, it's the same test, just the order of the names reversed. 

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the question's wording? It says "the distribution has". So under the null hypothesis, the distribution must have skewness and kurtosis as specified. Since the null is normal, so it must have 0 skew and 3 kurtosis. So option B. 

Hmm. Unless there's a different interpretation. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the null hypothesis is not that it's normal, but something else? That seems unlikely. The Jarque-Bera test's null is definitely normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the alternative hypothesis? But the question clearly states "under the null hypothesis". 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong? Or perhaps the user is mistaken? Alternatively, maybe I remember the Jarque-Bera test incorrectly? Let me check the formula once again. 

The formula is JB = (n/6) * [S^2 + (K - 3)^2 / 4], so yes, under the null, S=0 and K=3, so the test statistic is zero. Therefore, the correct parameters under null are zero skew and three kurtosis, so option B. 

Given that the user is stating that the correct answer is D, which is skewness one and kurtosis three, maybe there was a confusion between skewness and another term? For instance, in some contexts, people might refer to standardized moments differently? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a different test? For example, in some tests, the skewness might be defined differently. Wait, but I can't recall any common test where normal distribution would have a skewness of one. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the excess kurtosis? If the excess kurtosis is being tested, then the null would have kurtosis 0 (so total kurtosis 3), but that still doesn't help with the skewness. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that has an error, and the correct answer should be B but the options are labeled wrong? 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in transcribing the options? Let me check again: 

Options are: 

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, 

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, 

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, 

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

So under null, the correct is B. But the user says D is correct. Unless the test is not for normality but for another distribution. 

Wait, perhaps the test is for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis 3? For instance, maybe a different distribution like Poisson or something else? But the Jarque-Bera test is specifically for normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Wait, skewness is already standardized (divided by variance^1.5). Similarly, kurtosis is divided by variance squared. So, no, that doesn't change the values. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the standardized test statistic parameters? That is, the JB test is a combination of the skewness and kurtosis, but that doesn't make sense here. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between the skewness and another parameter? Like in some cases, people might confuse skewness with the mean? But mean isn't part of this. 

Wait, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the Bera-Jarque test? Wait, that's the same thing. It's a common thing to reverse the names. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where they defined the test with a different null hypothesis? For instance, if the null hypothesis was that the distribution has skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3, but that's not the case for a standard test. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different version of the test where they are testing against a specific non-normal distribution? For example, testing if the distribution has skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3? But the standard JB test's null is normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question to see if the examinee knows that the null is normality, which requires skew 0 and kurtosis 3, so option B. Therefore, if the answer given is D, that must be incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original question had different options? Maybe a misprint. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused between skewness and another statistic. For example, if they thought that the JB test is about variance? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context where the distribution under null is not normal? But the name of the test is Jarque-Bera, which is for normality. 

Hmm. Since I can't find any basis for the correct answer being D, unless there's a fundamental misunderstanding here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the question? 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again: Skewness is a measure of asymmetry. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0. Kurtosis measures the "tailedness", with a normal distribution having a kurtosis of 3. 

Therefore, the null hypothesis for the JB test is that the skewness is 0 and kurtosis is 3, so option B is correct. Therefore, unless there's a translation error or a misstatement in the question, the correct answer should be B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the JB test for a different distribution, not the normal distribution? For example, maybe the test is for a distribution that has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But I can't recall such a standard test. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted, asking for the alternative hypothesis? But then again, the question is explicit about the null. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking in terms of standardized skewness and kurtosis where they're divided by their standard errors? But that would be incorporated into the test statistic, not the parameters of the null. 

Alternatively, perhaps they are referring to a different type of kurtosis? For example, Pearson's measure vs Fisher's? Pearson's is different, but the standard Jarque-Bera uses Fisher's where normal has 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized skewness being 1? But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between moments and cumulants? Hmm, no. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and the correct answer is actually B, but the question's options are labeled incorrectly? 

Alternatively, maybe I need to check another source quickly. Let me think: 

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is defined as (n/6)*(s^2 + (k-3)^2/4), where s is sample skewness and k is sample kurtosis. Under the null of normality, the mean of the sample skewness is 0, and the mean of the sample kurtosis is 3. Therefore, the null hypothesis requires skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. Hence, the answer is B. 

Therefore, unless the question is incorrect, the user's assertion that the correct answer is D is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in transcribing the options here? Let me check again: 

The options listed are:

A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis,

B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three,

C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis,

D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.

So the user is saying that D is correct, but according to the test, it should be B. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test, but another test called Bera-Jarque? Wait, maybe a different test altogether? Maybe the user mixed up the name. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a textbook or source that has an error? 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some key point? Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the parameters of the distribution, but the parameters of the test statistic? 

The Jarque-Bera test is for the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed, so the distribution has to have those characteristics. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 

So in conclusion, unless there is a misunderstanding in the question's wording or a typo in the options, the correct answer should be B. However, the user is stating that the correct answer is D, which would imply a skewness of 1 and kurtosis of three. That seems incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different null hypothesis, such as testing if the distribution is logistic, which has a skewness of 0 and kurtosis of 4.5, but that's not relevant here. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a standardized version where they subtract the mean and divide by variance, but that doesn't affect the skewness and kurtosis values. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language and "Bera-Jarque" is a mistranslation? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between the Bera-Jarque test and another test like the Shapiro-Wilk test? But that's still for normality. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution where skewness is 1 and kurtosis is 3. For example, the log-normal distribution has higher kurtosis and skewness, but I don't know of a common distribution with exactly skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the null hypothesis is that the distribution is symmetric (zero skewness) and mesokurtic (kurtosis 3), which would still be B. 

Hmm. Unless there's a different way to compute kurtosis or skewness here? For instance, some sources use the Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness, but that's the same as regular skewness. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the population values versus some sample? But the null hypothesis is about the population distribution. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is inverted and the user is confused between the test statistic and the null hypothesis? 

Wait, the test statistic JB is a function of the sample skewness and kurtosis. The null hypothesis is that the population has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. 

So in conclusion, I think there's either a mistake in the question's options or the user is confused. The correct answer according to the standard Jarque-Bera test should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. 

But since the user is asking why the correct answer is D, maybe there's another angle I'm not seeing. Let me think again. 

Wait a second, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis used in the test? 

The JB test combines the skewness and kurtosis into a single statistic. The skewness in the JB test is the sample skewness divided by its standard error, and similarly for kurtosis? No, actually, the formula is as I mentioned before: (n/6)*(s^2 + (k-3)^2/4). So S is the sample skewness, K is the sample kurtosis. 

Wait, under the null, the expected value of sample skewness is 0, and the expected kurtosis is 3, so the formula makes sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring not to the parameters of the distribution, but the parameters of the test statistic? Like, the JB test statistic has a skewness of 1 and kurtosis of three? That seems unrelated. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the standard normal distribution's parameters, but that doesn't add up. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and option D is meant to be "zero skewness and kurtosis of three" but was mistyped as "skewness of one". 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D in another context. Wait, in some sources, do they define the Jarque-Bera test differently? Let me do a quick check mentally. 

Looking it up (in my mind), Jarque-Bera test null is normality (so skew 0, kurtosis 3). So unless the question is from a specific textbook that defines it differently, I can't see why D would be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the alternative hypothesis where the distribution has those parameters? But the question specifies the null. 

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Based on standard statistical theory, the answer should be B. But the user insists it's D. Perhaps the user made an error, or the question is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the options are misnumbered? Like option B is actually D in the original? 

Alternatively, maybe I need to see the question again. The user wrote:

"There is a multiple-choice question: Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has. The options are: A. Zero skewness and zero kurtosis, B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three, C. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis, D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.. Why the correct answer is D. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three."

Wait, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test? Maybe it's a different test. Let me think of other tests related to skewness and kurtosis. There's the D'Agostino test, which also tests normality using skewness and kurtosis, but similar to JB. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a test for a distribution like the Laplace distribution, which has skewness 0 and excess kurtosis 3 (so total kurtosis 6?), but that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a uniform distribution? The uniform distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis of -1.2, so that's not. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for an exponential distribution? Which has skewness 2 and kurtosis 9. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is for a different distribution where the null has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? 

Alternatively, if the question is about the log-normal distribution? Log-normal has positive skewness and higher kurtosis, but specific values depend on parameters. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is not for normality but for a different distribution where under the null, the skewness is 1. 

Alternatively, could the test be related to the Gamma distribution? Gamma distribution's skewness is 2/sqrt(kappa), where kappa is the shape parameter. So if kappa=4, skewness would be 1, but kurtosis would be 6 + 3/kappa, so 6.75. Not three. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Poisson distribution? Poisson has variance equal to the mean, skewness sqrt(1/mean), and kurtosis is 3 + 1/mean. For large mean, it approaches normality, but when lambda=1, skewness 1 and kurtosis 4. So not 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the triangular distribution? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where the JB test's null is that the distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That would mean the test is not for normality, which contradicts what I know. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the standardized JB statistic, but even then, the parameters of the null would still be 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Anderson-Darling test? But that's also for normality. 

Hmm. Since I can't find a basis for D being correct, I think the most plausible explanation is that the question has an error. The correct answer is B, and perhaps D was a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the null hypothesis but the alternative? If so, but the question says null. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that defines the null hypothesis as having a skewness of 1 and kurtosis 3. If that's the case, the null is for a different distribution, but then the test would not be Jarque-Bera. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a standardized skewness where they subtract the mean and divide by SD, but that doesn't change the skewness value. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness measure where they standardize by the standard error. The standard error of skewness is sqrt(6/n). So, for example, if the sample skewness is 0, its standardized value is 0. So that wouldn't affect the null hypothesis parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula for kurtosis. There are different formulas for calculating kurtosis. For instance, in some software, the kurtosis is calculated as Fisher's definition minus 3, so that the normal distribution has kurtosis 0. So, if the question is using the excess kurtosis, then under the null, kurtosis would be 0, so the correct answer would be A: zero skewness and zero kurtosis (if they are using excess kurtosis). Wait, but that would be option A. 

Wait, hold on! This could be the key point. Maybe in the question, they are referring to excess kurtosis instead of the standard kurtosis. 

In some contexts, people report excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis minus 3. For a normal distribution, excess kurtosis is 0. So if the question is using "kurtosis" to mean excess kurtosis, then under the null hypothesis (normal distribution), skewness is 0 and excess kurtosis is 0. That would make option A the correct answer. But the user says the correct answer is D, so that still doesn't align. 

Wait, hold on. If the question is using "kurtosis" as excess kurtosis, then the answer would depend on whether they are asking for standard or excess. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up skewness and kurtosis. For instance, if they thought that the test requires excess kurtosis of 3, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different parameterization where they want the skewness to be 1. But that would be a different distribution. 

Wait, perhaps they are referring to a standardized version where the skewness is divided by some value? For instance, in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test statistic uses the skewness divided by its standard error, so the standard error of skewness is sqrt(6/n). So the standardized skewness would be S / sqrt(6/n), and similarly for kurtosis. But under the null, the expected standardized skewness would be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the population parameters in some transformed way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct answer is B, but the user is misinformed. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are swapped? Like, if option D is the same as B but miswritten? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the test that the distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? But I don't know such a test. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the null hypothesis that the distribution has a skewness of one and kurtosis of three, making the JB test a test of that hypothesis? But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that incorrectly states that the Jarque-Bera test's null is that the distribution has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. In that case, the source is wrong, and the correct answer is B. 

In conclusion, after thorough consideration, the correct answer according to standard statistical knowledge is B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Therefore, either there is an error in the question's options, a misinterpretation of the question, or the user has transcribed it incorrectly. The assertion that the correct answer is D does not align with standard tests unless there's a specific context or different definition being used that I'm unaware of, which seems unlikely for a basic test like Jarque-Bera.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **Option B: Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not Option D. Here's the detailed explanation:

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose of the Jarque-Bera Test**: This test evaluates whether sample data has the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution. The **null hypothesis (H₀)** is that the data is normally distributed.

2. **Normal Distribution Properties**:
   - **Skewness**: A normal distribution is symmetric, so its skewness is **0**.
   - **Kurtosis**: A normal distribution has a kurtosis of **3** (using Fisher’s definition). Some sources report **excess kurtosis** (kurtosis minus 3), which is **0**, but the Jarque-Bera test explicitly uses the **raw kurtosis value** of 3 in its formulation.

3. **Formula of the Jarque-Bera Test Statistic**:
   \[
   \text{JB} = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{(K - 3)^2}{4} \right)
   \]
   - Here, \( S \) is the sample skewness and \( K \) is the sample kurtosis.
   - Under the null hypothesis (normality), the expected values are \( S = 0 \) and \( K = 3 \), making the test statistic zero.

4. **Analysis of the Options**:
   - **Option A (0 skewness, 0 kurtosis)**: Incorrect because kurtosis for a normal distribution is 3.
   - **Option B (0 skewness, 3 kurtosis)**: **Correct**, as this matches the normal distribution’s properties.
   - **Option C (1 skewness, 0 kurtosis)**: Incorrect—no valid reason for skewness of 1 under normality.
   - **Option D (1 skewness, 3 kurtosis)**: Incorrect—normality requires skewness of 0.

### Why Option D Is Incorrect:
The assertion that the correct answer is **D** likely stems from confusion or a mistake:
- A common error is conflating **excess kurtosis** (which is 0 for a normal distribution) with raw kurtosis (3). However, the Jarque-Bera test explicitly uses \( K = 3 \).
- Skewness of **1** has no basis in the normal distribution’s properties. A skewness of 1 would indicate asymmetry, contradicting normality.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as it aligns with the null hypothesis of the Jarque-Bera test requiring a normal distribution with **zero skewness and kurtosis of three**. If the question claims **D** is correct, it likely contains an error in wording or options.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I came across this question about the Bera-Jarque test and the null hypothesis. The options are about the skewness and kurtosis values under the null. The correct answer is supposed to be D: Skewness of one and kurtosis of three. But wait, that doesn't sound right to me. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Jarque-Bera test is used to check if a sample's data has the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. The null hypothesis in such a test is that the data is normally distributed. So, under the null hypothesis, the skewness and kurtosis should be those of a normal distribution. 

A normal distribution has a skewness of zero because it's symmetric. The kurtosis, on the other hand, is a measure of the "tailedness" of the distribution. But here's where I might be getting confused: sometimes kurtosis is reported as excess kurtosis. The formula for kurtosis can vary depending on whether it's the Pearson's moment coefficient or Fisher's. 

Let me recall: Fisher's definition of kurtosis is the fourth standardized moment minus 3. So, the excess kurtosis. For a normal distribution, the fourth moment is 3, so the excess kurtosis is 0. But some software or definitions might just present the kurtosis as the fourth moment itself. 

Wait, so if the Jarque-Bera test is based on comparing the sample skewness and kurtosis to that of the normal distribution, then under the null, the skewness is 0 and the kurtosis is 3 (since if you just take the fourth moment, it's 3, but if you subtract 3 for excess, it's 0). Hmm, so maybe the question is using the non-excess kurtosis?

Looking back at the options: A says zero skewness and zero kurtosis. But a normal distribution has skewness zero and kurtosis 3. So that would point to B: zero skewness and a kurtosis of three. Wait, so why is D being presented as the answer? D says skewness of one and kurtosis three. That doesn't align with the normal distribution's parameters. 

Is there a chance that I confused the Jarque-Bera test with another test? Let me double-check. 

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is defined as: 

JB = (n/6) * (S² + (C²)/4)

where S is the sample skewness, and C is the sample kurtosis minus 3 (so that's the excess kurtosis). So in the formula, they actually use the excess kurtosis. 

Therefore, under the null hypothesis of normality, the expected skewness S is 0, and the expected excess kurtosis (C) is 0. Therefore, the test is checking whether the skewness is zero and the excess kurtosis is zero. 

But the question is phrased as "the distribution has" under the null. If the question is talking about the regular kurtosis (not excess), then under the null, the kurtosis should be 3. So the correct answer should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. 

But the user is saying the correct answer is D, which is skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. That seems wrong. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the question was miswritten? Or maybe I made an error in my understanding?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is referring to a different kind of skewness or kurtosis? Let me check the definitions again.

Skewness for a normal distribution is indeed 0. Kurtosis, when calculated as the fourth moment divided by variance squared, is 3 for a normal distribution. So if the question is asking for kurtosis (not excess), then B is correct. 

But if the question mistakenly refers to skewness as being 1, that would be incorrect. The only way D could be correct is if there's a different baseline, but I can't think of any common statistic where the normal distribution has a skewness of 1. 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, or the question is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe "kurtosis of three" is correct, but the skewness part is a trick? But why would the skewness be one? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Like, the test statistics?

Wait, the Jarque-Bera test uses the sample skewness and the sample excess kurtosis. So under the null, the skewness is 0 and the excess kurtosis is 0. So if the question is referring to the excess kurtosis, then the kurtosis part would be zero. But the options don't have that. Option B says zero skewness and kurtosis of three, which would be correct if they are talking about non-excess kurtosis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is worded incorrectly. If the answer is D, the user must have confused the parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misremember the Jarque-Bera test. Let me look up the formula again (pretending to recall):

Jarque-Bera test statistic is: 

JB = (n / 2) * ( (skewness^2)/6 + ( (kurtosis - 3)^2 ) / 24 )

Wait, actually, the formula is (n/6)*(S² + (K - 3)^2 / 4). Wait, different sources might present slightly differently, but key point is that the test is based on S being 0 and K being 3 (so excess is 0). Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the distribution should have skewness 0 and kurtosis 3. 

So answer B is correct. 

So why does the user say the correct answer is D? That's conflicting. Maybe the original question had a typo? For instance, maybe "Bera-Jarque" is a different test? Or perhaps in some sources, the test is formulated differently?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but another test? Or maybe the user confused Jarque-Bera with another test where the null is different?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? Like in some tests, the test statistics are standardized, but even so, under the null, their expected values would still be 0 for skewness and 3 for kurtosis.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding between skewness and a different measure? Like, maybe "skewness of one" refers to something else?

Wait, maybe the question is in another context where the null hypothesis is a different distribution? Like a logistic distribution or something else? Let me check parameters of some common distributions.

A logistic distribution has a skewness of 0, but excess kurtosis of 1.2, so kurtosis of 4.2. Not matching D.

A Student's t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom has skewness 0, but kurtosis is 9, so excess 6. Not matching.

A uniform distribution has skewness 0 and kurtosis of -1.2, so excess -1.2. Not matching.

An exponential distribution has skewness 2, kurtosis 9, so excess 6. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct answer is B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not referring to the Jarque-Bera test but another test, and in that test the null has different parameters? Maybe "Bera-Jarque" is a mistranslation or misnomer?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to standardized skewness and kurtosis? For example, in some textbooks, they might define the test statistic as using standardized moments?

Wait, the standard Jarque-Bera test uses the regular skewness and kurtosis. The test statistic is calculated as (n/6)(S^2 + (K - 3)^2 /4). So under the null, S=0 and K=3.

Therefore, the answer should be B. The user might have the options mixed up or maybe saw a different version. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that incorrectly states the parameters?

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the alternative hypothesis? If the null is normal, then the alternative is non-normal, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people refer to standardized coefficients. For example, in some cases, the skewness is divided by its standard error, but under the null, the expected value would still be zero. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis" in the answer options. If the question is using "kurtosis" to mean excess kurtosis, then under the null, it would be zero. But then the answer would need to have zero for kurtosis. But none of the options have that except A, which has zero kurtosis and skewness. But that would be incorrect because the kurtosis of the normal distribution (in excess terms) is zero, but if the question is using "kurtosis" as excess, then the answer would still have zero skew and zero excess kurtosis, which is A. But A is zero for both, which would correspond to excess kurtosis. But that would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up terms? For example, if "kurtosis of three" is actually referring to excess kurtosis, then the question is wrong because excess kurtosis is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another statistical test where the null has different parameters, but it's mistakenly labeled as Jarque-Bera?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in transcribing the question. Maybe the correct answer is B, but they thought it's D? 

Alternatively, let me think if there is a test where the null has skewness 1 and kurtosis 3. For example, maybe a test for a different distribution like the Laplace distribution? Let me check: Laplace distribution has skewness 0, kurtosis 6 (so excess kurtosis 3). Hmm.

Wait, a Laplace distribution (double exponential) has excess kurtosis of 3, so total kurtosis 6. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, a Poisson distribution with λ=1 has skewness 1, and kurtosis 4. But kurtosis of a Poisson is (1 + 1/λ). So for λ=1, it's 2, so excess kurtosis 2-3? Wait, no, Poisson variance is λ, and fourth moment for Poisson is λ + 3λ² + λ³, but calculating kurtosis would be different. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a binomial distribution with p=0.5? Let's see, binomial(n,p) has skewness (1-2p)/sqrt(np(1-p)). If p=0.5, skewness is 0. Kurtosis is 3 - 6/(n p (1-p)). For large n, approaches 3. So as n approaches infinity, it becomes normal. But that's again zero skewness and kurtosis approaching 3.

Hmm. Alternatively, an exponential distribution? But skewness is 2, kurtosis 9 (so excess 6).

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different type of skewness? Like Pearson's first skewness? Which is (mean - mode)/std dev. But for normal distribution, mean=mode, so that's zero. 

Alternatively, maybe they confused Pearson's second skewness, which is (3(mean - median))/std dev. Still zero for normal.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the test for a different distribution? Like, perhaps a test for a uniform distribution? But uniform distribution has skewness 0, kurtosis -1.2 (so excess -2.2). Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a test where the null is a distribution with skewness 1 and kurtosis 3? That would be a specific distribution, but I can't think of a common one. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let's see: If someone thought that the skewness of a normal distribution is 1, but that's wrong. The skewness is definitely zero. Similarly, maybe someone confused variance (which is 1 in standard normal) with skewness?

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that had a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the Jarque-Bera test but the D'Agostino-Pearson test? Let me check. The D'Agostino test also examines skewness and kurtosis, but I think it's similar. The null would still be normality, so skew 0, kurtosis 3.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to standardized test statistics? Like the skewness divided by its standard error. But under the null, the expected value is still zero, so the mean of that would still be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized kurtosis? The standard error of kurtosis is sqrt(24/n), but again under the null, the expected value is 3 (or 0 excess). 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different definition where the kurtosis is 3 for some reason, but skewness is 1. That would be a very strange distribution, but perhaps in some contexts?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where "distribution" refers to the distribution of the test statistic under the null? Then the JB test statistic is asymptotically chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom. But that's about the test statistic's distribution, not the data's distribution. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some sources, the Jarque-Bera test is defined differently? Let me check the formula again. 

The Jarque-Bera statistic is indeed based on the sample skewness and the sample excess kurtosis. The formula is JB = (n/6)(S² + (C)^2 /4), where C is the excess kurtosis (kurtosis minus 3). Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the expected S is 0 and the expected C is 0. Therefore, the distribution under the null must have S=0 and C=0, which implies kurtosis of 3 and skewness 0. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: zero skewness and kurtosis of three. 

Therefore, the user must have made an error in stating that D is the correct answer, or perhaps the original question was incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the alternative hypothesis? If the alternative is that the distribution has skewness of 1 and kurtosis 3, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the standardized skewness and kurtosis where, under the null, they have a mean of 0 and some variance, but then the actual parameters would still be 0 and 3.

Alternatively, if there's confusion between sample and population parameters, but no, under the null, the population parameters should be 0 and 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the Anderson-Darling test or another goodness-of-fit test, but those don't specify skewness and kurtosis in their null.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and "Bera-Jarque" is a mistranslation, leading to confusion? For example, in some languages, the order of names might be different, but that shouldn't affect the content.

Alternatively, maybe the original question had a different set of options, and there was a transcription error here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where "distribution" refers to the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null, but in that case, the JB statistic would be chi-squared with 2 df, which has skewness sqrt(8/chi^2 df) so sqrt(8/2)=2, so skewness 2/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)≈1.414, and excess kurtosis 12/chi^2 df = 12/2 =6, so kurtosis of 8. So that's not matching any options here either.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the distribution of the estimator of skewness and kurtosis? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the user is confused. 

Given all this, I think the correct answer should be B. So the user might have a mistake in their source or in transcribing the question. The answer D (skewness 1 and kurtosis 3) doesn't align with the properties of normal distribution or the Jarque-Bera test. 

Perhaps the options are mislabeled? Like, maybe option D was supposed to be zero skew and three kurtosis, but got mixed up. Or maybe in the original question, the correct answer was B, but the user thought it was D because of a mistake. 

Alternatively, if I made a mistake in recalling, let me confirm: 

- Normal distribution skewness: 0

- Normal distribution kurtosis (Pearson's): 3

- Excess kurtosis: 0

Thus, under the null hypothesis of JB test (normality), the skewness should be 0 and kurtosis 3. So B is correct. 

Therefore, unless there's some obscure variation of the test, the correct answer must be B. Hence, the user might have been given incorrect information or there's a mistake in the question's options. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that uses a different definition where "kurtosis" refers to excess, so they say "kurtosis of three" meaning excess kurtosis is three? But that would be non-standard. In that case, the normal distribution's excess kurtosis is zero, so the kurtosis would be 3 (if "kurtosis" refers to the total), but in that case, the answer would still require the kurtosis to be 3, but with skewness zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is using "kurtosis of three" to mean excess, which would be wrong. If someone mistakenly thought that the excess kurtosis of normal is 3, then they would have an incorrect answer. 

But given standard definitions, B is correct. 

Therefore, the user's assertion that D is correct is likely an error. Unless there's some other context, but I can't think of any. 

Conclusion: The correct answer should be B. The user might have a mistake in their question or source.
</think>

The correct answer to the question should be **B. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three**, not **D**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Jarque-Bera Test Overview**:  
   The Jarque-Bera (JB) test checks whether a sample's skewness and kurtosis match those of a **normally distributed** dataset. The null hypothesis states that the data follows a normal distribution.

2. **Normal Distribution Properties**:  
   - **Skewness**: A normal distribution has **zero skewness** (symmetric).  
   - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis of a normal distribution is **3** (when measured using Pearson's moment coefficient). This value is often referred to as **excess kurtosis** when subtracted by 3 (resulting in zero excess kurtosis), but the standard kurtosis (not "excess") is **3**.

3. **Jarque-Bera Test Formula**:  
   The JB statistic is calculated as:  
   \[
   JB = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{(K - 3)^2}{4} \right),
   \]  
   where \(S\) is the sample skewness and \(K\) is the sample kurtosis. Under the null hypothesis, \(S = 0\) and \(K = 3\).

4. **Why Option D (Skewness 1, Kurtosis 3) is Incorrect**:  
   - A skewness of **1** implies an asymmetric distribution, which contradicts the normal distribution's symmetry.  
   - There is no common statistical distribution (let alone the normal distribution) with a skewness of 1 and kurtosis of 3 under the JB test's null hypothesis.  

5. **Potential Sources of Confusion**:  
   - **Excess Kurtosis**: Some sources might report "excess kurtosis" (kurtosis minus 3), which would be **0** for a normal distribution. However, the question explicitly lists kurtosis values (not "excess"), so the correct kurtosis is **3**.  
   - **Typographical Errors**: The question or its options might contain a typo, mixing up the parameters. For example, if "D" were intended to state "zero skewness and kurtosis of three," it would align with the correct answer (B).

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **B**. The confusion likely arises from a misinterpretation of skewness/kurtosis definitions or an error in the question's wording. Option D is incorrect because there is no basis for the normal distribution to have a skewness of 1. 

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{B}
