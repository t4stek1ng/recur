There is a multiple-choice question: Let M be a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with tape alphabet {blank,0,1}, and let C denote the (possibly infinite) computation of M starting with a blank tape. The input to each problem below is M, together with a positive integer n. Which of the following problems is (are) decidable?
I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.
II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.
III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.. The options are: A. None, B. III only, C. I and II only, D. I and III only. Why the correct answer is B. III only?<|im_end|>

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about decidability of three different problems related to a deterministic Turing machine M starting on a blank tape. The options are I, II, and III, and we need to determine which of them are decidable. The given answer is B: III only. 

First, let me recall what decidability means. A problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can always answer the question in finite time, right? So for each problem I, II, III, I need to check whether there's an algorithm that, given M and n, can decide the problem in finite steps.

Let me start with problem I: "The computation C lasts for at least n steps."

Hmm, so this is asking if the machine M runs for n or more steps before halting (or maybe it doesn't halt at all?). Wait, the computation C is "the (possibly infinite) computation," so maybe C could be infinite. So the question is, does C last at least n steps? So if the machine runs forever, then it definitely lasts at least n steps for any n. But if it halts before n steps, then no. 

Wait, but to decide whether C lasts at least n steps, we can simulate the machine for n steps, right? Because if we simulate M starting on blank tape, and run it step by step, then after n steps we can check whether it has halted yet. If it hasn't halted by step n, then the answer is "yes," otherwise "no." 

Similarly, but to decide whether C lasts at least n steps, we can simulate the machine for n steps, right? Because if we simulate M starting on blank tape, and run it step by step, then after n steps we can check whether it has halted yet. If it hasn't halted by step n, then the answer is "yes," otherwise "no."
