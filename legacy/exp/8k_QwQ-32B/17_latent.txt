Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get? Why the correct answer is 13?<|im_end|>

Okay, so Mia's restaurant is hosting a function with 42 adults and 15 babies tomorrow. They need to figure out how many more chairs she has to get. The problem says the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. The answer is supposed to be 13, but I need to work through it step by step to make sure.

First, let me parse the problem again. There are two groups of people: adults and babies. Adults will need regular chairs, and babies will need high chairs, I assume. The restaurant already has some chairs, specifically 8 high chairs and a number of regular chairs that's 5 times the high chairs. So first, let me note down all the numbers given.

Number of adults: 42. These need regular chairs.

Number of babies: 15. These need high chairs.

Restaurant's current chairs:

High chairs: 8.

Regular chairs: 5 times the high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, then regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Wait, hold on. If the ratio is 5:1 (regular to high chairs), then regular chairs are 5 times the high chairs. So yes, 5*8=40 regular chairs.

So the restaurant currently has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs.

Now, the function requires 42 adults (so 42 regular chairs needed) and 15 babies (so 15 high chairs needed). 

So let's see how many chairs they need versus how many they have.

For regular chairs:

They need 42, they have 40. So they are short by 42 - 40 = 2 regular chairs.

For high chairs:

They need 15, they have 8. So they are short by 15 - 8 = 7 high chairs.

Therefore, total chairs needed additionally would be 2 + 7 = 9 chairs. Hmm, but the answer is supposed to be 13. Wait, maybe I did something wrong here.

Let me check again. Maybe I misunderstood the ratio. The problem says the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So if there are 8 high chairs, then regular chairs are 5*8=40. That part seems correct.

Number of babies is 15, so high chairs needed: 15. They have 8, so 15-8=7 more high chairs needed.

Adults: 42 need regular chairs. They have 40, so 2 more regular chairs needed. Total 7 + 2 = 9. But the answer is 13. Hmm, so where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the problem counts both chairs and high chairs as total chairs? Let me check the question again: "how many more chairs does she have to get?" So chairs might refer to all chairs, including high chairs. Wait, but high chairs are a type of chair. Maybe they are considered a separate category but still chairs. Wait, but the problem might be assuming that high chairs can't be used as regular chairs and vice versa. So perhaps we need to calculate separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me check again:

"Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?"

Therefore, maybe the problem counts both chairs and high chairs as total chairs? Let me solve equation 3 for y: "how many more chairs does she have to get?" So chairs might refer to all chairs, including high chairs. Wait, but high chairs are a type of chair. Maybe they are considered a separate category but still chairs. Wait, but the problem might be assuming that high chairs can't be used as regular chairs and vice versa. So perhaps we need to calculate separately.

Additionally, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me set up equations for that:

"Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?"

Yes, maybe the problem counts both chairs and high chairs as total chairs? Let me see: "how many more chairs does she have to get?" So chairs might refer to all chairs, including high chairs. Wait, but high chairs are a type of chair. Maybe they are considered a separate category but still chairs. Wait, but the problem might be assuming that high chairs can't be used as regular chairs and vice versa. So perhaps we need to calculate separately.

Wait, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me try this approach:

"Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?"
