Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.

If we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,
what can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth?
Why the correct answer is 9 Gpc?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this problem about a quasar observed at near-infrared and optical wavelengths, with a peak at 790 nm and a significant flux drop below that wavelength. The question is asking about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth in a Lambda-CDM universe with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Lambda=0.7, and flatness. The answer is supposed to be 9 Gpc. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that when astronomers observe quasars, their spectra often show emission lines that are redshifted. The peak at 790 nm might correspond to a rest-frame wavelength that's been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The drop in flux at shorter wavelengths could be because the quasar's intrinsic spectrum has a cutoff or because of absorption features, but maybe it's more straightforward.

Wait, maybe the peak is an emission line, like Lyman-alpha or something else. Let me recall typical quasar emission lines. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm, but if it's observed at 790 nm, the redshift would be (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ (668.4)/121.6 ≈ 5.5. That seems high, but quasars can have high redshifts. Alternatively, maybe it's the Mg II line at around 280 nm? Let me check: 280 nm to 790 nm would give (790 - 280)/280 ≈ 510/280 ≈ 1.82. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe the Hydrogen Balmer lines? Like H-alpha at 656 nm. If observed at 790, then redshift (790 - 656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204, so z≈0.2. But the flux drop below 790 could be the Lyman break at 912 A (91.2 nm), which is a true cutoff due to absorption in the intergalactic medium. Wait, the Lyman break is at 912 A, so if observed at longer wavelengths than that, so if the observed Lyman break is at 790 nm, then the redshift would be (790 nm - 91.2 nm)/91.2 nm ≈ (698.8)/91.2 ≈ 7.66? Wait, but that would mean the quasar is at redshift ~7.66? But that seems extremely high. However, quasars with z around 7 exist, like the record holder is around z=7.5. Maybe that's the case here?

Alternatively, if the flux drops below 790 nm, that might indicate that the Lyman break is at 790 nm, so the rest-frame Lyman break is at 91.2 nm, so (790 nm)/91.2 nm = 1 + z ≈ 8.66, so z ≈7.66. That would be a very high redshift. Then, the problem is to find the comoving distance at that redshift in the given Lambda-CDM model.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is not the Lyman break but another feature. Let me think again. The problem says there's a peak at 790 nm and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. If the peak is from an emission line, but there's a significant drop below that, maybe it's the Lyman break because the intrinsic UV emission is cut off by the Lyman limit (912 A in rest frame), so when redshifted, the observed Lyman break is at 790 nm, which would mean a redshift of z = (790 nm / 91.2 nm) -1 ≈ (8.66) -1 ≈7.66. Yeah, that's plausible. So the quasar is at z≈7.66.

Now, given that redshift, I need to calculate the comoving distance. The comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe is given by the integral from 0 to z of c / H(a) * da, but more practically, there's an integral over the scale factor a, but the standard formula is:

comoving distance D_c = c * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1 / H(z')] dz'

Wait, actually, the comoving distance is the integral of the speed of light divided by the Hubble parameter over the redshift. But maybe more precise formula is needed.

In terms of the scale factor, but perhaps it's easier to use the standard formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_c(z) = (c/H0) * ∫₀^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1 + z)^3 + Ω_Lambda)

Given that H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, and Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Lambda=0.7 (so Ω_k=0 for flatness).

So first, let's confirm the redshift. If the Lyman break is observed at 790 nm, then its rest wavelength is 91.2 nm, so 1 + z = 790 / 91.2 ≈ 8.666, so z ≈7.666. Let's take z=7.666666...

Now, plugging into the integral for D_c.
