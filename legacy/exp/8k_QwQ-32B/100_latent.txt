The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.

Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable represented by matrix P on the system in state (-1, 2, 1) at time t will yield 0. The answer is supposed to be 1, but I need to figure out why. Let me start by recalling some quantum mechanics basics.

In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is represented by a ket vector, which in this case is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, here called P. To find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue, say 0, we need to look at the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and compute the squared modulus of the inner product between the system's state and each of these eigenvectors, then sum them up.

First, I need to confirm that P is indeed a Hermitian matrix. Looking at the given matrix:

First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Let me check if it's Hermitian. Since all elements are real, the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Transposing the matrix:

First column becomes first row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
Second column becomes second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
Third column becomes third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Which is the same as the original matrix. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the subspace spanned by those eigenvectors.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value of P and see if it relates to the probability? Wait, no, expectation value is different. Let me not confuse that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the spectral decomposition of P. Since P is Hermitian, it can be written as a sum of projectors onto its eigenspaces multiplied by their eigenvalues. The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the norm squared of the projection of the state onto the 0-eigenspace.

Therefore, steps:

1. Find all eigenvalues of P, especially eigenvalue 0.

2. Find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

3. Form the projection operator onto that eigenspace.

4. Compute the inner product of the state vector with each of those eigenvectors, square the modulus, sum them up.

Alternatively, take the state vector, project it onto the 0-eigenspace, then compute its norm squared. Either way, I need to know the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: since the question states the answer is 1, maybe the state is already an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0? Then the probability would be 1. Let me check that.

Wait, let me first try to compute eigenvalues of P.

So, the matrix P is:

[ 0        1/√2    0     ]

[1/√2     0      1/√2 ]

[ 0        1/√2    0     ]

This is a symmetric matrix, so eigenvalues are real. To find eigenvalues, we can compute the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix P - λI:

[ -λ      1/√2      0     ]

[1/√2   -λ       1/√2 ]

[ 0      1/√2    -λ     ]

Compute determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)^2 ] - 1/√2 [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, let me compute step by step. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |

| d e f |

| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So applying this to the matrix P - λI:

First row elements: a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0

Second row: d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2

Third row: g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

Thus determinant is:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[ ... ]

Similarly, let me compute step by step. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |

| d e f |

| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So applying this to the matrix P - λI:

First row elements: a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0

Second row: d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2

Third row: g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

Good determinant is:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[ ... ]

No, let me compute step by step. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |

| d e f |

| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So applying this to the matrix P - λI:

First row elements: a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0

Second row: d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2

Third row: g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

Similarly determinant is:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[ ... ]
