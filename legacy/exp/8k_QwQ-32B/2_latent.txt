A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full? Why the correct answer is 3000?<|im_end|>

Okay, let's see. The problem is about filling a tank with a capacity of 18,000 gallons over two days. Wanda and Ms. B are working shifts, and we need to figure out how much water they pumped each day, then subtract that from the total capacity to find out how much is left. The answer is supposed to be 3,000 gallons remaining, but I need to verify that step by step.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I get all the details right. The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons. On day one, Wanda and Ms. B work in shifts. Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity. Hmm, so that would be 1/4 of 18,000? Let me confirm that. The problem says "filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water," so yes, that should be 1/4 of 18,000. Then Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda did that day. So Ms. B's contribution on day one is 3/4 of Wanda's day one contribution.

Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. So that's 2/3 of her day one amount. And Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So Ms. B's day two contribution is 1/3 of her day one contribution.

We need to calculate the total water pumped over two days and subtract from 18,000 to find the remaining.

Alright, let me break this down step by step with numbers.

First, day one:

Wanda's contribution: 1/4 of tank capacity.

Tank capacity is 18,000, so:

Wanda day 1 = (1/4) * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons.

Then Ms. B's day 1 contribution is 3/4 of what Wanda pumped that day, so:

Ms. B day 1 = (3/4) * 4,500.

Let me compute that: 4,500 divided by 4 is 1,125, so 3 * 1,125 = 3,375. So 3,375 gallons.

Therefore, total for day one is Wanda + Ms. B = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

Alright, moving on to day two.

Wanda's day two pumping is 2/3 of her day one amount. So:

Wanda day 2 = (2/3) * 4,500.

Calculating that: 4,500 divided by 3 is 1,500, so 2 times 1,500 = 3,000 gallons.

Ms. B's day two pumping is 1/3 of her day one amount. Her day one was 3,375, so:

Ms. B day 2 = (1/3) * 3,375.

3,375 divided by 3 is 1,125. So 1,125 gallons.

Therefore, total for day two is 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total over two days would be day one plus day two: 7,875 + 4,125. Let me add those up.

7,875 + 4,125. Hmm, 7,875 + 4,000 is 11,875, then add the remaining 125, so total is 12,000 gallons.

Wait, 7,875 plus 4,125:

7,875 + 4,125

Break it down:

7,000 + 4,000 = 11,000

875 + 125 = 1,000

So total is 11,000 + 1,000 = 12,000. Yep, that's right.

So total pumped over two days is 12,000 gallons. The tank's capacity is 18,000, so remaining is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000.

Wait, but the problem says the correct answer is 3,000. Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.

Thus, but the problem says the correct answer is 3,000. Hmm, so maybe I misread the problem's days. Let me denote.

Ah, but the problem says the correct answer is 3,000. Hmm, so Maybe in Chinese or another language. Let me check my calculations again step by step.
