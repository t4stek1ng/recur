Okay, so I need to figure out why the answer is C. The Rydberg constant for the question about de Broglie's hypothesis relating linear momentum and wavelength. Hmm, wait a second. I remember that de Broglie's equation is lambda equals h over p, right? Where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. So that would relate wavelength and momentum with Planck's constant. But the question is saying the correct answer is Rydberg's constant. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Let me start from the beginning. De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. His famous equation is wavelength λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. So in this equation, the constant involved is Planck's constant, which would be option A. But the question states that the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant. That contradicts what I know. Maybe there's a trick in the question?

Wait, let me check the question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are Planck's, Boltzmann's, Rydberg's, or the speed of light. Hmm. So the equation λ = h/p uses Planck's constant, so A should be the answer. So why is the correct answer supposed to be C?

Is there a possibility that the question is referring to a different version of the formula, perhaps with a different constant? Let me think about the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg constant is related to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, right? The formula for the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen is given by 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant. That's definitely not related to momentum. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between different constants? Planck's constant h and the reduced Planck's constant ħ are often used, but the question lists them as Planck's constant, so that's h. The Rydberg constant is a different constant altogether, usually denoted by R_H or just R. 

Wait a second, could the question have a typo? Or maybe I'm misremembering de Broglie's equation? Let me confirm. Yes, de Broglie's hypothesis is that matter has a wavelength inversely proportional to its momentum, with h as the proportionality constant. So λ = h/p. Therefore, the constant involved is Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, is there a scenario where Rydberg's constant is involved? Maybe if considering the wavelength in terms of energy, but even then, energy and momentum are related through E = pc for massless particles, but for massive particles, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². However, the de Broglie wavelength is purely λ = h/p, regardless of energy. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the combination of constants in some context where Rydberg's constant comes into play? For example, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, which uses ħ (Planck's over 2π). The Rydberg constant in the Bohr model is derived from fundamental constants including h, so maybe there's a connection. But the original de Broglie equation is more basic and doesn't involve the Rydberg constant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is tricking me by using "free massive particle". In some contexts, free particles might refer to particles not in a bound state, but I don't see how that would relate to Rydberg. The Rydberg constant is specifically about hydrogen atom transitions. 

Wait, maybe there's a confusion between the wave number and wavelength? The Rydberg constant has units of reciprocal length (since it's 1/λ), while the de Broglie wavelength is in terms of h over p. The wave number k is 2π/λ = p/(h/2π) = p/ħ. But that still uses Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, could the question be referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c), but that's for photons scattering off particles. Still involves h. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect? Or maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another angle. The Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097e4 per meter. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The de Broglie wavelength is h over p, so the units are (J s) / (kg m/s) = m, which works. Rydberg's constant has units of 1/m, so if the equation was relating momentum and wavelength with Rydberg's constant, it would require something like p = R_H * λ, but that would have units of (1/m)*m = 1, which is not momentum. So that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up constants. Let me think of other constants. Boltzmann's constant is k_B, which is in units of J/K, so that's different. The speed of light is in m/s. The question is about a relation between momentum (kg m/s) and wavelength (m), so the constant must have units of (kg m^2/s), which is the unit of Planck's constant (J s). So the only constant that can fit is Planck's. Rydberg's is 1/m, speed of light m/s, so none of the others make sense. 

Therefore, unless the question is wrong, maybe C is a trick option. Wait, perhaps the question is from a different source where they made a mistake? Alternatively, maybe de Broglie's original hypothesis used a different constant? Let me check history. 

De Broglie's hypothesis came before the development of the Bohr model? No, the Bohr model was earlier. De Broglie in 1924 proposed the wave nature of electrons, using the relation λ = h/p. That's the basis of wave mechanics. The Rydberg constant was known from the late 19th century for spectral lines. 

Alternatively, maybe in some textbooks or contexts they equate Rydberg's constant with h/(2π m e), but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relation involving energy and wavelength, but even then, energy E = h f, and p = h / λ, so combining gives E = p²/(2m) (if non-relativistic), but that's a different relation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different language and there was a translation error? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the options? 

Alternatively, let me consider the options again. The question asks which constant relates linear momentum and wavelength. The equation is λ = h/p, so h is Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. So unless the question has an error, the correct answer is A. The user is saying that the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, but that contradicts my knowledge. 

Wait, unless in some contexts the Rydberg constant is used in combination with other constants to express the relation. Let's see, the Rydberg constant R_H is equal to (m e^4)/(8ε₀²h³c), so maybe if you rearrange that, but that seems convoluted. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation in terms of wave number (k), which is 2π/λ, so k = p/(ħ). Then, if you write k = p/(ħ), so the constant there is ħ, but ħ is h/(2π), so still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the constant in the equation of the wavefunction's phase, like exp(i(kx - ωt)), where k = p/ħ. But again, that involves ħ, which is part of Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(m c). But that involves mass and speed of light. So that would use h and c. But the question is about momentum and wavelength. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Given that I can't find any relation where de Broglie's wavelength uses Rydberg's constant, I think the correct answer should be A, Planck's constant. The user might have made a mistake in stating the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the original question had different options? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the formula for the wavelength in terms of energy? Let me think. For a photon, E = hc/λ, so λ = hc/E. But for a particle with momentum p, E² = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, but the de Broglie wavelength is still h/p. 

Alternatively, maybe they confused the Rydberg constant with something else. The Rydberg unit of energy is R_H hc, so if you have energy levels related to that, but again, not directly related to momentum and wavelength. 

Hmm. Since the user is asking why the correct answer is C (Rydberg), but all my reasoning points to A (Planck), maybe I need to consider that perhaps in some specific context or a different formulation? 

Wait, let me check the de Broglie formula again. The original equation is λ = h / p. So the relation is that wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum, with h being the proportionality constant. Therefore, the constant is h, Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the energy levels of an electron in an atom where Rydberg's constant comes into play, but that's a different scenario. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where none of the options are correct, but the user states that C is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to check sources. Let me think of standard references. The de Broglie wavelength equation is definitely λ = h/p. For example, in any introductory quantum mechanics textbook, this is the first equation introduced. 

Therefore, I have to conclude that either the question is incorrect, or there is a misunderstanding. The Rydberg constant has nothing to do with de Broglie's hypothesis. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the formula for the momentum in terms of the Rydberg constant? Like p = R_H * something? Let me see units again. Rydberg constant is 1/m. Momentum is kg m/s. So if you had R_H multiplied by something with units of kg m^2/s, you could get momentum. But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language where the terms are mistranslated. For example, if the term "Rydberg constant" was mistranslated from another term. 

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the Rydberg constant and the Rydberg formula? But the formula uses the constant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, and the intended answer is A, but the user is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the original question had a different wording. Let me read again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A to D. 

Wait, maybe in the de Broglie relation, the constant involves h divided by 2π, so the answer is ħ, which is Planck's constant divided by 2π, but the question just says Planck's constant as an option, so A would still be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the proportionality constant with a different symbol? Like in some contexts using h-bar instead, but the question lists Planck's constant as an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an older source where they used a different constant? I don't think so. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled? Like the options given to the user might have been different, but they transcribed it wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the direct relation but an inverse relation? Like p related to wavelength via Rydberg? But units don't add up. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the wave equation's angular frequency or something else, but that's a stretch. 

Wait a minute, maybe the user made an error in their question? They said the correct answer is C, but according to all standard references it's A. 

Alternatively, could there be a confusion between the Rydberg constant and the de Broglie wavelength in some specific problem? For instance, if an electron is in a hydrogen atom, then its energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula, and its wavelength could relate via de Broglie, but that's combining two different concepts. The Rydberg constant there comes from the Coulomb interaction and the Bohr model constants. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a distractor where the user is supposed to know that Rydberg is related to wavelength in atoms, but de Broglie's hypothesis is general for any particle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, and the actual correct answer is A, but the user says it's C. Since I need to answer why it's C according to the user, but I can't find a valid reason. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the reciprocal of wavelength? Like 1/λ = p/(h), so if the question was asking which constant relates to 1/λ and p, then h, but the question says wavelength and momentum. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a test that had an error. 

In conclusion, based on standard physics, the relation between momentum and wavelength according to de Broglie is given by λ = h/p, so the constant is Planck's constant (A). There's no involvement of the Rydberg constant here. Therefore, unless there is a specific context or a mistake in the question, the correct answer should be A. However, since the user states that the correct answer is C, there must be an error either in the question or the provided answer. 

Perhaps the original question had different options, or there was a misprint. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the Rydberg constant with another constant. Since I can't reconcile the Rydberg constant with de Broglie's equation, I can only surmise that there's an error here. But since I have to answer why it's C, perhaps I need to think differently. 

Wait, could it be that the question refers to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c), so that uses the speed of light, which is D, but not Rydberg. 

Alternatively, if the question is about the relation in terms of energy, like E = hc/λ for photons, but again, that's photon energy, not de Broglie. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the formula for the momentum of a photon, which is p = h/λ, so same as de Broglie, so still h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where none of the options are correct except A, but the user says C. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a different field, like chemistry, where sometimes constants have different names? No, Rydberg is definitely a spectroscopic constant. 

Hmm, I think I have to conclude that there's a mistake here. The correct answer should be Planck's constant, so A. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated. Therefore, either the question is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Since the user is asking why the answer is C, perhaps they copied the question incorrectly, or the original source had an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the combination of constants in the Rydberg formula that indirectly involves momentum? Let me think. The Rydberg constant is related to the ionization energy of hydrogen. The ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen, which is related to its momentum via the kinetic energy. So maybe if you write the kinetic energy as p²/(2m) = Rydberg energy, then you could solve for p in terms of the Rydberg constant? 

Let's try that. The Rydberg energy R_E is approximately 13.6 eV, and it's equal to (m e^4)/(8ε₀²h³)c² or something like that. But if we consider the energy of the electron in the ground state as kinetic energy (assuming non-relativistic), then KE = p²/(2m) = R_E. Then p = sqrt(2m R_E). But that's relating momentum to the Rydberg energy, not the Rydberg constant itself. The Rydberg constant R_H (wave number) is related to R_E by R_H = R_E/(hc). So R_H = (m e^4)/(8ε₀²h³c), so if you rearrange for h, h = sqrt(m e^4/(8ε₀² R_H c)). But that's a complicated relation and not the direct de Broglie relation. 

Alternatively, if the question was asking about the combination of constants in a specific problem where both momentum and wavelength are involved with Rydberg, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-physics context where terms are used differently? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between momentum and wavelength in the context of the Rydberg atom, where highly excited atoms have electron wavelengths comparable to the orbital size, but still, the fundamental relation would still be de Broglie's equation with h. 

Hmm. I think I have to state that according to standard physics, the correct answer is A, Planck's constant, and that the claim that it's the Rydberg constant is incorrect. Unless there's some obscure relation I'm missing, but I can't think of any. 

Perhaps the user intended to present a different question, or there's a typo. For example, if the question was about energy levels in hydrogen, then Rydberg would be correct, but not for de Broglie's hypothesis. 

Another angle: maybe the question is referring to the wavelength in terms of the momentum expressed as p = h/λ, so rearranged, pλ = h, so the constant is h. Still Planck's. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a language where "Rydberg constant" is a mistranslation of "Planck's constant". In some languages, constants might have different names or homophones? 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the relation involving the Rydberg frequency? The Rydberg unit of frequency is approximately 3.29e15 Hz, which is related to the Rydberg constant via f = R_H c. But again, that's a different constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the fine-structure constant, but that's also not the case here. 

I think I need to stop here. The conclusion is that the correct answer is A, Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated. Therefore, the question likely contains an error. 

But since the user insists that the correct answer is C, maybe I need to explain why someone might mistakenly think that. Perhaps confusing the use of Rydberg in the context of wavelength with de Broglie. For example, the Rydberg constant is often associated with the wavelength of light emitted by hydrogen atoms, so someone might confuse that with the wave nature of particles. 

Alternatively, in some educational materials, perhaps an incorrect question was presented, leading to this confusion. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation in terms of the reciprocal wavelength (wave number), where k = p/(ħ), so if someone thought the Rydberg constant is the proportionality constant between momentum and wave number, but the Rydberg constant is specifically for hydrogen transitions. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is very old, from a time when constants were named differently? Unlikely. 

In summary, based on my knowledge, the answer should be A, Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant is not involved. Therefore, the question's listed answer of C is incorrect. 

However, to answer the user's question: "Why the correct answer is C?" I can only surmise that there's a mistake in the question or the provided answer. But if I have to explain why someone might think it's C, perhaps due to confusion between the Rydberg constant (which relates to wavelengths in the hydrogen spectrum) and the de Broglie wavelength (which relates to particle momentum). The Rydberg constant is specifically for the wavelengths of photons emitted from hydrogen atoms, not for the wave-like properties of particles in general. Therefore, the confusion might arise from conflating these two distinct concepts.
</think>

The correct answer to the question should be **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's why:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie proposed that **all matter has wave-like properties**, with the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a particle related to its linear momentum (\(p\)) by the equation:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, \(h\) is **Planck's constant** (Option A). This equation directly ties momentum and wavelength through Planck's constant, making **A the correct answer**.

2. **Rydberg Constant (Option C)**:  
   The **Rydberg constant (\(R_H\))** is specific to atomic physics and describes the wavelengths of spectral lines emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms. Its formula is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]  
   This constant is unrelated to de Broglie’s wavelength-momentum relationship, which applies universally to all massive particles, not just hydrogen atoms.

3. **Why the Rydberg Constant Is Incorrect**:  
   - The Rydberg constant has units of **reciprocal length** (\(1/\text{m}\)), whereas the de Broglie equation requires a constant with units of **action** (e.g., Planck’s constant \(h\), which has units \( \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \)).  
   - The Rydberg constant arises from the quantization of atomic energy levels in the Bohr model, a concept distinct from de Broglie’s wave-particle duality.

### Conclusion:
There is a **mistake in the question’s stated answer**. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated to de Broglie’s hypothesis. The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**, as it is the fundamental constant linking momentum and wavelength in wave-like behavior of particles.

### Possible Reasons for Confusion:
- **Misinterpretation of Constants**: The Rydberg constant is often associated with atomic spectra, leading to confusion with wavelength-related physics.  
- **Question Error**: The question might have been miswritten, or the answer key might contain a typo.  
- **Historical Context**: Early quantum theory mixed concepts like atomic spectra (Rydberg) and wave-particle duality (de Broglie), but they remain distinct.

In summary, the Rydberg constant is not involved in de Broglie’s hypothesis. The correct answer is **Planck’s constant (A)**.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the Rydberg constant is the correct answer for the question about De Broglie's hypothesis relating linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. Wait a second, I'm a bit confused because I remember De Broglie's equation being something like wavelength equals Planck's constant divided by momentum. Hmm. Let me think.

The question states that De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength are related by a certain constant. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, Rydberg constant, and speed of light. I thought De Broglie's formula is λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. So why would the answer be the Rydberg constant here?

Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recall each constant's role. Planck's constant (h) is indeed the proportionality constant in quantized energy levels and in the wave-particle duality equations like De Broglie's. Boltzmann's constant (k) is related to thermal physics, connecting temperature and energy. The Rydberg constant (R) is used in atomic physics, particularly in the Rydberg formula for hydrogen spectral lines. The speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant in relativity and electromagnetism.

Wait, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the wording? The question says "related by which of the following constants." In De Broglie's equation, the relation is λ = h / p, so the constant involved is Planck's constant. So why would the answer be C? That doesn't make sense.

Is there a possibility that the question is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misremembering De Broglie's formula? Let me check another way. Maybe the question is referring to a different relation? For instance, in the Rydberg formula, the wavelengths of hydrogen are given by 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). But that's specific to hydrogen transitions. 

Alternatively, could the question have a typo or misstatement? Maybe they meant to ask about the relation between energy and wavelength, which would involve the Rydberg constant in some contexts? Or perhaps in some version of the formula, the Rydberg constant is used instead? Wait, no, De Broglie's relation is general for any particle, not just electrons in hydrogen. 

Alternatively, maybe in some units or under certain conditions, the Rydberg constant comes into play? Let me see. The Rydberg constant has units of energy or inverse length. Planck's constant has units of J·s or kg·m²/s. The momentum p has units of kg·m/s, so h/p would give m, which is wavelength. So the units check out for Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is phrased incorrectly, maybe they confused De Broglie's relation with something else? For example, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, so there the speed of light is involved, but that's photons, not massive particles. For a massive particle, the De Broglie wavelength is h/p, so again, Planck's constant.

Wait, could there be a confusion between the wave number and the wavelength? The wave number k is 2π/λ, and sometimes in some equations constants might come into play differently. But even so, if you write p = hbar * k, then hbar is still Planck's constant over 2π. So the fundamental constant is still Planck's.

Hmm. Maybe the question is wrong, or maybe I need to consider historical context? De Broglie proposed his hypothesis before the Rydberg constant was established? No, the Rydberg constant was known much earlier, from the study of spectral lines in the late 19th century. De Broglie's work was around 1924, so the constants would already be in use. 

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the question? If the question was about the energy levels of a particle in a box, maybe Rydberg comes into play? No, the energy levels there would involve h²/(8mL²), so Planck's again.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the direct relation between p and λ, but another relation where Rydberg is involved? I can't think of any such relation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is not the most direct one? But that seems unlikely. Maybe a confusion between the Planck constant and the Rydberg constant because both are used in quantum mechanics? But their roles are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the original question had a typo, and the options were different? Or the question was misreported? The user says the options are A to D as listed, and the correct answer is C. The Rydberg constant. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, the Rydberg constant is used in combination with momentum? For instance, the Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, which is the ionization energy of hydrogen, but how would that relate to the momentum of an electron? The momentum of the electron in the Bohr model is related to the Rydberg constant? Let me see. 

In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, so p = mv = nħ/r. The radius of the nth orbit is proportional to n²/Z, so substituting that in, the momentum would be proportional to 1/n. The energy is - Rydberg constant * (Z²/n²). Hmm, but the relation between p and λ would still be through the De Broglie equation, so p = h/λ, so λ = h/p. Therefore, even in that case, the constant involved is h.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the correct answer is A, Planck's constant. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question's wording? Let me re-read the question carefully.

"De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?"

Hmm. So the relation is between p and λ, and the constant involved is one of the four options. The equation is λ = h/p. So the constant is h, Planck's constant, which is option A, so answer A. Unless the question is phrased in another way. Wait, "related by which of the following constants"—maybe the question is referring to the energy-wavelength relation? For example, in photons, E = hc/λ, but that's energy, not momentum. 

Alternatively, the question might be phrased incorrectly, perhaps they meant frequency instead of wavelength? The relation between energy and frequency is E = h f, so Planck's constant again. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts the Rydberg constant is used as a combination of other constants? The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1, and it can be expressed in terms of other constants like the electron mass, charge, Planck's constant, etc. So R = (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀²h³c). But that's a combination, not the direct relation. 

Alternatively, if the question is asking which constant is used in the equation, the direct one is Planck's. The Rydberg constant is derived from other constants, so it's not the fundamental one here. 

Wait a second. Maybe the question is from a textbook or exam that had a different version? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in transcribing the question? Because according to standard physics, De Broglie's relation uses Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, is there any chance that the Rydberg constant is involved in the relation between momentum and wavelength? Let me think of the Rydberg formula again: 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). That's for the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen. So if an electron transitions between two energy levels, the emitted photon has wavelength related to the Rydberg constant. But that's not about the particle's own wavelength. 

Wait, if you consider the electron in the Bohr model, its de Broglie wavelength would be related to its orbit. The circumference of the orbit is 2πr = nλ, so λ = 2πr/n. But the momentum p = mv, and angular momentum L = mvr = nħ. So p = m v, and L = r p = nħ. Therefore, p = nħ / r. Then, the wavelength λ = h/p = h/(nħ/r) )= (h/(n (h/(2π)))) * r = 2πr /n. Which matches the earlier relation. So here, the Rydberg constant doesn't come into play, only Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, if you were to express the Rydberg constant in terms of the electron's momentum, but that seems indirect. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some unit system, like atomic units, the Rydberg energy is used, but that's energy, not directly momentum or wavelength. 

Hmm. Given that all the reasoning points to Planck's constant being the correct answer, and the question insists it's the Rydberg constant, I might have to consider that perhaps the question is incorrect, or there's a trick. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a key point here. 

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the direct relation, but the historical context? De Broglie's idea might have been inspired by the Rydberg formula? But even so, the actual relation he proposed is with Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a translation issue? If the original question was in another language, perhaps "constant" refers to something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in terms of the wave number (k), which is 2π/λ. So k = p/(ħ), which would involve ħ (h-bar), so still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is formulated in terms of energy and wavelength, so using E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, but that's relativistic energy-momentum relation. For a photon, E = pc, so λ = hc/E, so that's Planck's constant again. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a distractor and the user is confused because they think Rydberg is involved in wave-particle duality? But I can't see a connection. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between momentum and wavelength in terms of the Rydberg constant's units? But Rydberg is in terms of 1/meter, and wavelength is also in meters, but the constant relating them would need to have units of momentum times meters, which is action, which is Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c), so that involves Planck's constant and the speed of light. But that's a specific case for photons interacting with particles. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, and the user is mistaken, but since they say the correct answer is C, I need to find a reason. 

Wait, let me check the values of the constants numerically. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. The Rydberg constant is about 1.097e7 m^-1. 

Suppose someone wanted to write the De Broglie wavelength in terms of the Rydberg constant. Let's see. 

Suppose λ = R * something. But R is 1/m, so to get meters, you need something with inverse (1/m), so maybe p/(hc)? Then R is 1.097e7 m^-1, so if λ = h/p, then p = h/(λ) = h * R * (1/(R λ)), but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, if you consider the Rydberg energy (E_R = 13.6 eV), which is energy, and momentum p = sqrt(2mE), so p = sqrt(2 m E_R). Then, λ = h/p = h / sqrt(2 m E_R). But that would involve E_R, but that's a specific case for an electron in hydrogen. Not a general relation for any free massive particle. 

Alternatively, if you set the kinetic energy equal to the Rydberg energy, but again, that's not general. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the correct answer is A, Planck's constant, but the user was told that it's C? Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like in spectroscopy, when dealing with photons emitted by electrons transitioning between energy levels, the wavelength is related to the Rydberg constant, but that's different from the de Broglie wavelength of the electron itself. 

Given all this, I can't see a valid reason why the Rydberg constant would be the correct answer here. It must be an error in the question or the options. The standard De Broglie equation uses Planck's constant. Maybe the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, if the question was about energy levels, then Rydberg would be correct, but as it's stated, it's about the relation between momentum and wavelength for a free massive particle, so Planck's constant is the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and the answer is D, the speed of light? If someone confuses the photon's wavelength with De Broglie's equation, the photon has E=pc, so p=E/c, and E=hc/λ, so p= h/λ, so again h is the constant. 

Wait, maybe the question is referring to relativistic De Broglie wavelength? The relativistic form would still be λ = h/p, because even relativistically, p is the relativistic momentum, but the constant is still h. 

Alternatively, if considering four-momentum, but that complicates it further, but still, the relation between wavelength and momentum is h. 

Another thought: sometimes the Rydberg constant is written as R_H = α² m_e c/(2 h), where α is the fine-structure constant. But that's expressing R_H in terms of other constants. So in that case, h is still the fundamental constant here. 

Alternatively, if in the equation, someone used Rydberg constant multiplied by another term to get momentum, but that would be non-standard. 

Given all this, I think the correct answer must be Planck's constant (A), and there's either an error in the question's options or perhaps a miscommunication. The user might have seen a different version, or maybe the question is from a source that has an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the wave number (k) instead of wavelength? Since k is 2π/λ, so k = p/(ħ), so ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. Still, the constant involved is ħ or h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the energy associated with the particle's wavelength? Like E = h f, but that's energy and frequency, not wavelength and momentum. 

Alternatively, could the question have a typo where "wavelength" was supposed to be "energy"? If they asked about energy and wavelength, then for a photon it's E = hc/λ, so that would use the speed of light and Planck's. But even then, the constant would still involve h and c. 

Hmm, this is perplexing. Since the user insists the correct answer is C, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the original hypothesis by De Broglie. 

De Broglie's hypothesis was that particles have wave-like properties, and the wavelength is inversely proportional to their momentum. The exact equation he proposed was λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. This is fundamental to wave-particle duality. 

Therefore, the correct constant should be A, Planck's constant. 

Unless there's some other constant involved that I'm not considering. Maybe the question is referring to the proportionality constant in a different equation? 

Wait, another thought: the Rydberg constant is related to the Bohr model's radius and energy levels, which in turn relate to the momentum of the electron in those orbits. But the De Broglie wavelength is a general concept, not limited to electrons in atoms. 

Alternatively, if someone derived the Bohr radius using De Broglie's wavelength, then you end up involving the Rydberg constant indirectly through the Bohr model equations, but the direct relation between p and λ is still via h. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like in solid-state physics or crystal diffraction, different constants come into play, but the question specifies a free massive particle, so those wouldn't apply. 

I think I have to conclude that the question is either incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the options provided. The correct answer based on De Broglie's hypothesis is Planck's constant (A). The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated to the general momentum-wavelength relation.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie proposed that the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a free massive particle is inversely proportional to its linear momentum (\(p\)), given by the equation:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, \(h\) is **Planck’s constant**, which is the fundamental constant directly relating momentum and wavelength.

2. **Roles of the Other Constants**:  
   - **Boltzmann’s constant (\(k\))**: Relates thermal energy to temperature, unrelated to wave-particle duality.  
   - **Rydberg constant (\(R\))**: Governs the wavelengths of hydrogen spectral lines (e.g., \(1/\lambda = R(1/n_1^2 - 1/n_2^2)\)), specific to atomic transitions.  
   - **Speed of light (\(c\))**: Relevant for photons (\(E = pc\) or \(E = hc/\lambda\)), but not for the general De Broglie relation for massive particles.

3. **Why the Rydberg Constant (C) Is Incorrect**:  
   The Rydberg constant appears in the **Rydberg formula** for hydrogen-like atoms, describing photon wavelengths emitted during electron transitions. It does **not** relate to the momentum-wavelength relationship for a free particle. The Rydberg constant is derived from other constants (like \(h\), \(m_e\), and \(c\)), but it is not the foundational constant for De Broglie's hypothesis.

### Conclusion:  
The question likely contains an error. The correct constant for De Broglie's relation is **Planck’s constant (A)**. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated to this general principle and belongs to atomic spectroscopy. If the question insists on "C" as the answer, it may stem from confusion between De Broglie’s hypothesis and the Rydberg formula for hydrogen.

**Final Answer:**  
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. The Rydberg constant is not involved in the De Broglie relation; it is a distractor.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer to the question about De Broglie's hypothesis is the Rydberg constant. Wait, hold on. I thought De Broglie's equation was lambda equals h over p, right? That's the formula where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum. So if that's the case, then the constant involved should be Planck's constant, which is option A. But the user is saying the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Let me start by recalling what each of these constants represents. Planck's constant (h) is fundamental in quantum mechanics, relating energy and frequency. Boltzmann's constant (k) is used in statistical mechanics, connecting temperature and energy. The Rydberg constant (R) is related to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, determining the wavelengths of spectral lines. The speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant in relativity.

De Broglie's hypothesis came about when he proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. His key equation is indeed lambda = h / p. So this directly involves Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant is more about the specific energy differences in hydrogen, so I don't see how that would come into play here. 

Wait, could there be a different formulation or a different version of the equation that uses the Rydberg constant? Or maybe a common confusion between constants? Let me think about the units. The wavelength's unit is meters. Planck's constant has units of J·s, and momentum is kg·m/s. So h/p has units (J·s)/(kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s²·s)/(kg·m/s) ) = m. That works. 

Rydberg's constant has units of wavenumber, which is reciprocal meters (1/m). That's because it's used in equations like 1/lambda = R(1/n² - 1/m²). So if the question was about the reciprocal of wavelength, then Rydberg's constant would come into play, but the question specifically mentions wavelength related to momentum. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Could the question have been about energy quantization or something else where Rydberg comes up? For instance, the energy levels of hydrogen are quantized, given by E_n = -Ry * hc / n², where Ry is the Rydberg constant. But that's energy levels, not directly related to De Broglie's wavelength. 

Wait another angle: De Broglie's equation is a general relation for any particle, not just electrons in hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is specific to hydrogen spectral lines, so unless the question is specifically about electrons in hydrogen atoms, the Rydberg shouldn't be involved. The question says "a free massive particle", which would not be bound in an atom, so the Rydberg constant is irrelevant here. 

Perhaps there was a trick in the wording? The question says "related by which of the following constants". De Broglie's relation is lambda = h/p, so the constant is h, Planck's. So why would the answer be Rydberg?

Wait, maybe the question is from a test where the options were mislabeled? Or maybe the user made a mistake in stating the options? Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(m c), but that's a different relation involving the speed of light, but even then, the constant would be h and c. Hmm, but the Compton wavelength is a specific case. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where it's asking which constant is NOT involved, but the user says the correct answer is C. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm misremembering De Broglie's hypothesis? Let me check again. De Broglie's original proposal was that the wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum. The exact relation is lambda = h / p, so h is the Planck's constant. 

Another possibility is that the question is referring to the formula in some other form. For example, sometimes the reduced Planck constant ħ is used, but that's still Planck's constant divided by 2pi. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the De Broglie wavelength and the Rydberg's constant in some context. For instance, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, which connects to the Rydberg constant in the energy levels. But that's the Bohr model, not directly De Broglie's hypothesis. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language, and there was a mistranslation? Like "constante de Rydberg" vs "constante de Planck". But the user wrote the options in English. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a distractor and the options were different? Or maybe the user is confused because in some textbooks, the Rydberg constant is used in the context of electron wavelengths in atoms, but again, that's not De Broglie's general hypothesis. 

Wait, let's check the Rydberg constant value. The Rydberg constant is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. Planck's is 6.626e-34 J·s. They are very different in magnitude and units, so unless the question was about reciprocal wavelength, but even then, you would still need to relate it through energy. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about energy and wavelength via E=hc/lambda, so then the constant would be h and c, but that's for photons. De Broglie's equation is different. 

Hmm, I'm really confused here because I can't see how the Rydberg constant would be the answer here. The user is insistent that the correct answer is C, but according to standard physics, it should be A. Maybe there's an error in the question? Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some context? 

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the relationship between linear momentum and wavelength. The formula is lambda = h / p. So the constant is h, Planck's. The Rydberg constant is involved in energy levels and emission spectra. Unless the question is a trick or there is a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the hypothesis that the momentum is related to the wavelength via the Rydberg constant? That would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some formulation, the Rydberg is expressed in terms of h and other constants? Let me recall that the Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^3 c) ) or something like that. So it's expressed using Planck's constant, but it's not the same thing. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-physics field, like chemistry, where sometimes constants are mixed? But even in chemistry, De Broglie is associated with h. 

Alternatively, could the user have mixed up the question? Like maybe the question was about the Rydberg constant's relation, but mistyped it? 

Alternatively, maybe the original question had different options? Let me think again. The options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light. 

So given those options, the correct answer must be A. So why would someone think it's C? Maybe a common misconception? Like confusing the Rydberg constant with something else. 

Wait, maybe in some contexts, when calculating the wavelength of an electron in a hydrogen atom, you might end up with a relation that involves the Rydberg constant? For example, the De Broglie wavelength of an electron in the nth orbit in Bohr's model is 2pi r, and from Bohr's model, r = n² a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius. The circumference would be 2pi n a_0. But according to De Broglie, the wavelength is h/p, and the momentum p = m v. In Bohr's model, m v r = n h-bar, so p = m v = n h / (2 pi r). Therefore, lambda = h / p = (h) / (n h/(2 pi r)) ) = 2 pi r / n. But in Bohr's model, the circumference is 2 pi r = n lambda, so that's consistent with constructive interference. But in that case, the Rydberg constant comes into play when considering energy levels, but not directly in the wavelength-momentum relation. 

Alternatively, energy levels E_n = -Ry h c / n². If you're relating momentum to energy, then p = sqrt(2 m E), but E = -Ry h c / n². So p would involve Ry, but that's mixing energy with momentum, but the direct relationship is via h. 

Hmm. Maybe the user is confused because in some problem they encountered, the Rydberg constant was involved, but that would be in a specific scenario like the energy levels. But the question here is about the general De Broglie relation for any free particle. 

Alternatively, is there a different version of De Broglie's relation? For example, sometimes people write the de Broglie wavelength as lambda = h / (gamma m v) for relativistic particles, but that still uses h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between momentum and frequency, not wavelength? For that, the relation would be E = h f, so frequency f = E/h. But De Broglie also related the phase velocity and group velocity with frequency and wavelength, but the key momentum-wavelength relation is lambda = h/p. 

I can't think of any scenario where the Rydberg constant would be the answer here. Unless the question was worded incorrectly. Maybe instead of De Broglie, it should be someone else? Like Balmer or Rydberg? The Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R(1/n² - 1/m²). But that's for spectral lines. 

Alternatively, the question might have a typo where "Rydberg" is a distractor and the correct is Planck, but the user is saying the correct is Rydberg. 

Alternatively, maybe the original question had different options, but the user listed them as A to D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a test where the options were misassigned. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the constant is part of a combination? For example, sometimes in the Rydberg formula, the constant R is defined as R = (e^4 m_e)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^3 c), so in that case, h is inside the Rydberg constant, but the question is about which constant relates them directly. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking which constant is involved in the relationship, and if the Rydberg constant includes Planck's, then perhaps it's a trick? But that seems convoluted. 

Alternatively, maybe the person who set the question made a mistake, and the correct answer is A, but they thought Rydberg. 

Alternatively, maybe in some non-standard formulation or in a different theory? 

Alternatively, I might have to conclude that there's a mistake here, and the correct answer should be A. However, since the user is asking why the correct answer is C, maybe they encountered this in a test where the options were different, or there was a misinterpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the Rydberg constant's relation to momentum? But I don't recall any such relation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the Rydberg constant is equal to (m e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^3 c), so it involves h, but that's still h being part of it, so the fundamental constant there is h. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when calculating the wavelength of a particle in a box, but that's quantum mechanics with boundary conditions, not directly De Broglie. 

Hmm, I'm really not seeing a scenario where the Rydberg constant would be the correct answer here. Unless the question is fundamentally flawed. So perhaps the user is mistaken, or there was an error in the question. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the energy levels of a particle, and they confused energy with momentum? For example, the energy levels in a hydrogen atom involve the Rydberg constant, but De Broglie is about momentum-wavelength. 

Alternatively, maybe the question says "which constant is related to both linear momentum and wavelength" and the Rydberg isn't, but again, not sure. 

Alternatively, the question might have a hidden context. For instance, in some derivations, the Rydberg constant comes up through combination of constants, but again, not directly in the De Broglie relation. 

Wait, another angle: the De Broglie wavelength formula is derived from equating the photon's momentum p = E/c with p = h/lambda, so for a photon, E = hc/lambda. But for a particle, it's a different approach. But that still uses h. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), so that involves the speed of light, but that's a different relation. 

Alternatively, in some textbooks, the Rydberg constant is presented as a fundamental constant alongside h, but I don't think so. Rydberg is derived from other constants. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another language where "Rydberg's constant" is commonly confused with "Planck's constant" due to translation? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a historical one, about what De Broglie thought, but I don't think he used the Rydberg constant. 

Wait, let me check the original hypothesis of De Broglie. He posited that particles have wavelengths lambda = h/p, which was later confirmed. So unless he initially thought it was related to another constant, but I don't recall that. 

Therefore, after all this thinking, I can't find a valid reason why the answer would be the Rydberg constant. It must be a mistake. The correct answer should be A, Planck's constant. The user might have encountered a question with a typo or their source is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the options are presented in a non-standard way. Like if the question is about the inverse relationship, but then it's still h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the formula but about the discovery? Like De Broglie used Rydberg's work? Not that I know of. 

Alternatively, the question might have been about which constant is not involved, but the user says the correct is C. 

I think I have to conclude that the user might have either made a mistake in the question or the source of the question is incorrect. The standard answer is Planck's constant, so option A.
</think>

The correct answer to the question should be **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie proposed that the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a free massive particle is inversely proportional to its linear momentum (\(p\)). The fundamental equation is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, \(h\) is **Planck’s constant**, directly linking momentum and wavelength. This is the cornerstone of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

2. **Role of the Rydberg Constant**:  
   The Rydberg constant (\(R_\text{H}\)) is specific to atomic physics, particularly the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. It appears in formulas like the Rydberg formula for spectral lines:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\text{H} \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]  
   It does **not** relate momentum (\(p\)) and wavelength (\(\lambda\)) for arbitrary particles, but rather describes transitions between quantized energy states in hydrogen.

3. **Other Constants**:  
   - **Boltzmann’s constant (\(k\))** relates temperature and thermal energy.  
   - **Speed of light (\(c\))** is key in relativity but not in the basic De Broglie relation.  

### Why the Rydberg Constant Is Incorrect:
- The question specifies a **general free massive particle**, not an electron bound in hydrogen. De Broglie’s hypothesis applies universally, while the Rydberg constant is context-specific to atomic transitions.  
- The Rydberg constant itself is derived from Planck’s constant (\(h\)) and other fundamental constants (\(m_e, e, \epsilon_0, c\)):  
  \[
  R_\text{H} = \frac{m_e e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^3 c}
  \]  
  Thus, Planck’s constant underpins the Rydberg constant but is not interchangeable with it in the De Broglie formula.

### Conclusion:
The confusion likely arises from conflating the Rydberg constant (specific to atomic energy levels) with Planck’s constant (universal in wave-particle duality). The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. If the question states otherwise, it may contain an error or a misinterpretation of the concepts involved.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. The Rydberg constant for the question about de Broglie's hypothesis relating linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. Wait, actually, I thought de Broglie's equation was lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant. That would make the answer Planck's constant, which is option A. But the user says the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

De Broglie's hypothesis is that particles have wave-like properties, and the wavelength associated with a particle is given by lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. That's from what I remember in my physics class. So according to this, the constant involved should be Planck's constant, so option A. But why would the answer be the Rydberg constant?

Maybe the question is tricky or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are Planck's, Boltzmann's, Rydberg, speed of light.

Wait a second, the Rydberg constant is usually associated with the energy levels of hydrogen atoms and the wavelengths of spectral lines, like in the Rydberg formula: 1/lambda = R*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). So that's the Rydberg constant. But de Broglie's equation uses Planck's constant. So why would the answer be Rydberg? Is there a chance that maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps there's confusion between terms?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different version or a different context? Let me think if there's any scenario where the Rydberg constant is related to momentum and wavelength. Hmm. The Rydberg constant has units of energy, actually. Let me recall: Rydberg's constant R_H is approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1, but that's the reciprocal meter, which is 1/wavelength. Wait, actually, the Rydberg constant is sometimes expressed in terms of wave numbers (1/lambda), so maybe that's a unit confusion?

But de Broglie's equation is lambda = h / p. So solving for p, that's p = h / lambda. So the constant involved here is Planck's constant. So unless the question is phrased in terms of wave number (k), which is 2pi/lambda, then k = 2pi p / h. But in that case, the constant would still be hbar (h/(2pi)), but the question is about the constant involved in the relation between momentum and wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where they consider the relationship in terms of energy? But even then, the Rydberg constant is about energy levels in hydrogen. For a free particle, the kinetic energy is p²/(2m), but that's not directly using Rydberg.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the question? Because the standard de Broglie relation uses Planck's constant. Alternatively, perhaps the options were mislabeled? Or maybe there's a different version where someone thought the Rydberg constant was involved here?

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different language, and there's a mistranslation? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect. Let me check some sources quickly. Let me think.

Looking up de Broglie wavelength: Yes, the formula is λ = h / p. Therefore, the constant is Planck's constant. So the correct answer should be A. Therefore, the user might have an error in their question's options or the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a non-English source where "Rydberg constant" is used differently?

Alternatively, maybe the original question was about something else, and there was a mistake in translating the question or the options. Alternatively, the user might have mixed up the question. Let me see if there are any other constants related to momentum and wavelength.

Wait, the fine-structure constant involves Planck's constant, but that's not in the options. The speed of light (option D) is related to energy and momentum in relativity, but in the de Broglie equation, unless it's relativistic, but even then, the equation is still lambda = h / p, where p is relativistic momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the question was about photons? For photons, energy E = pc, so E = hc/lambda, so p = h/lambda. But again, that still uses Planck's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between the Rydberg constant and the Rydberg formula? Because Rydberg constant is about spectral lines, not about matter waves. Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. So, given that, I think the user might have an error in their answer key, or maybe there's a trick here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? Which is h/(mc), so involves Planck's constant and the speed of light, but that's a different constant combination.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between momentum and wavelength in another context. Wait, Boltzmann's constant is for thermal physics, like in the equipartition theorem, or in the kinetic theory of gases. So that's probably not it.

The speed of light is in relativity equations, but not directly in the de Broglie relation (unless you write it in terms of energy, but p = gamma mv, but still the constant is h).

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased in a way that's different. Let me parse the question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So they are asking which constant is part of the equation relating momentum and wavelength. De Broglie's equation is wavelength = h / p, so the constant is Planck's constant, so A. So why is the user saying the answer is C? Maybe they saw a different version of the question?

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that in some units, or perhaps the question is inverted? Like maybe they said the relation uses the Rydberg constant, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original question was about the Rydberg constant and got mixed up.

Wait, unless there's an equation that somehow uses Rydberg. Let me think again. The Rydberg constant is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1, which is 1/lambda for the Lyman series in hydrogen. But how would that relate to a general particle's momentum and wavelength?

Alternatively, if the question is in terms of energy and wavelength, the energy of a photon would be hc/lambda, so then E = pc (for photons) so p = h / lambda, so same as de Broglie. But for a particle with mass, the energy is (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2? Wait, no, relativistic energy is sqrt((pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2). But that complicates things, but the de Broglie wavelength for a particle is still h over its momentum, regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different constant, but I can't think of any. Unless the question was about the relation between momentum and wavelength in a crystal lattice, like Bragg's law? But Bragg's law involves the spacing between crystal planes and the angle of diffraction, but that's not directly the same as de Broglie's hypothesis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the user is confused. Because I can't think of a scenario where the Rydberg constant would come into play here. The Rydberg constant is specifically for Hydrogen spectral lines. So unless the question was about the relation in hydrogen's case, but even then, the de Broglie wavelength would still involve Planck's constant.

Wait a minute, if you consider a particle in a hydrogen atom, like an electron, then its de Broglie wavelength would relate to its momentum via h, but the Rydberg constant is more about the energy levels. So perhaps someone confused the energy levels (which use Rydberg) with the de Broglie wavelength?

Alternatively, perhaps the question combined two concepts. For example, if an electron is moving in a hydrogen atom, its kinetic energy is related to the Rydberg energy, but its de Broglie wavelength is still h over its momentum. So even in that case, the momentum and wavelength are connected via Planck's constant. So the Rydberg constant would be involved in energy, not in the wavelength-momentum relation.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly worded, and instead of "linear momentum and wavelength", it should say "energy levels of a hydrogen atom", in which case Rydberg would be correct. But as stated, the question is about de Broglie's hypothesis, which is about matter waves, so it should be Planck's constant.

Therefore, I think there must be an error in the question or the provided answer. The correct answer should be A) Planck’s constant. The Rydberg constant is unrelated here. Unless there's some historical context where de Broglie used a different constant, but I don't recall that.

Wait, let me check historical facts. De Broglie proposed his hypothesis in 1924, and the Rydberg constant was established earlier, in the context of spectroscopy. But the relation between momentum and wavelength would still need Planck's constant, which was already known since Planck's work in 1900. So de Broglie's equation would naturally use Planck's constant. So there's no way the Rydberg constant is involved here unless the question is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(mc), which involves the speed of light, but that's for photons interacting with particles, and even so, it's h divided by mass times c. But that would involve Planck's constant and the speed of light. Not Rydberg.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the student is supposed to know that de Broglie's relation is an inverse relation between momentum and wavelength, so the constant is in the denominator, so h, but maybe the question is worded to say "related by which constant", and if you write p = h / lambda, h is the constant, so same.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-English source where the term was mistranslated. Alternatively, the user might have misread the options. Alternatively, maybe the options were presented in a different order?

But according to the information given, the options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light. So according to standard physics, correct answer is A. So unless there's a trick or error, the user's assertion that the correct answer is C is wrong. Maybe they saw a similar question and mixed up the constants?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relation between momentum and frequency? Because frequency would involve energy. For a photon, E = hf, and E = pc, so pc = hf => p = hf/c, so p = h/(lambda) because f = c/lambda. So that still is h over lambda. So even then, Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if you consider the energy of a free particle, E = p^2/(2m), but that relates energy to momentum quadratically, and if you involve wavelength, then E = h f, so h f = p²/(2m), so combining with p = h / lambda, then you can get E = h²/(2m lambda²), but again, the key constant is h.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation in a different dimension? Like in 2D or something? But that shouldn't change the constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Bohr model? The Bohr model uses the Rydberg constant for the radius or energy levels? The Bohr radius is (4pi epsilon0 hbar^2)/(m e^2), which involves Planck's constant again. The Rydberg constant is derived from the Bohr model parameters, so it's related to Planck's constant, but the original question is about de Broglie's hypothesis, which is different from Bohr model.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong, and the person who made it confused the Rydberg constant with Planck's? It's easy to see how that might happen if someone is not careful.

Alternatively, perhaps the term "free massive particle" is key here. The Rydberg constant is for bound states (like electrons in Hydrogen), so a free particle would not involve that. So again, the answer should be Planck's constant.

Therefore, after going through all possibilities, I think the correct answer is A, Planck's constant, and there must be an error in the original question's provided answer. The Rydberg constant is not related to the de Broglie wavelength equation. So unless there's some nuance I'm missing, the user might have made a mistake in the question's details.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the relationship between the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle as hypothesized by de Broglie should be **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's why:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie's equation relates the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a particle to its momentum (\(p\)):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, \(h\) is **Planck’s constant**, which directly connects momentum and wavelength for any free particle. This is the foundation of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

2. **Rydberg Constant (\(R_H\))**:  
   The Rydberg constant is specific to atomic physics, particularly the spectral lines of hydrogen. It appears in the Rydberg formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]  
   This constant describes energy transitions in bound systems (e.g., electrons in hydrogen atoms), not free particles. It is unrelated to de Broglie's wavelength-momentum relation.

3. **Why the Rydberg Constant Is Incorrect**:  
   - The Rydberg constant arises from the Bohr model and quantized energy levels, not from wave-particle duality.  
   - A "free massive particle" implies no forces or potentials acting on it, so there is no role for constants tied to specific atomic systems like hydrogen.  
   - If the question involved the wavelength of an electron in a hydrogen atom (e.g., during a transition), the Rydberg constant might be relevant, but that is not the case here.

4. **Common Misconceptions**:  
   - Occasionally, confusion arises between Planck’s constant (\(h\)) and other constants like the Rydberg constant (\(R_H\)) or the speed of light (\(c\)).  
   - However, de Broglie’s equation specifically uses \(h\), as it links momentum (a classical quantity) to wavelength (a wave property), necessitating a quantum constant like Planck’s.

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated to de Broglie’s hypothesis and pertains to atomic spectral lines instead. The confusion may stem from mixing concepts in atomic and quantum physics, but the question as stated clearly tests knowledge of the de Broglie wavelength formula. 

**Final Answer:**  
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. The Rydberg constant is not involved in this relation.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question here about de Broglie's hypothesis and which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, Rydberg constant, and the speed of light. The question says the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, but that doesn't make sense to me. Wait, I thought de Broglie's equation was wavelength equals h over momentum, right? So that's Planck's constant. Let me think again.

De Broglie proposed that particles have wave-like properties, and the wavelength associated with a particle is related to its momentum. The formula I remember is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. So that would mean the constant involved is Planck's constant. But the options say the answer is Rydberg constant. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe there's a different version or a different context. Let me recall: the Rydberg constant is usually related to the energy levels of hydrogen atoms, right? Like in the Rydberg formula for spectral lines: 1/λ = R*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant. So that's about the wavelengths of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen. But de Broglie's wavelength is about matter waves, not photons. So that's a different concept. 

Boltzmann's constant is k_B, which relates energy and temperature, part of the ideal gas law and in statistical mechanics. The speed of light, c, is obviously a big constant in relativity and electromagnetism. 

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question? Because de Broglie's original hypothesis did use Planck's constant, so if the answer is supposed to be Rydberg, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Or maybe it's a translation error? Let me check the original question again. 

The question states: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A-D, with C being Rydberg. But according to what I know, de Broglie's equation is definitely using Planck's constant. So the correct answer should be A. Maybe the question is incorrect? Or maybe I'm forgetting some other context where Rydberg comes into play here?

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when converting between energy and wavelength, Rydberg might be involved? Let me think. For example, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, so if you have a particle's momentum p = h/λ, then rearranged, λ = h/p. But the Rydberg constant is in electronvolts or inverse meters? Wait, the Rydberg constant has units of energy, right? Approximately 13.6 eV, which is the ionization energy of hydrogen. Or in terms of wavelength, maybe it's expressed in 1/m? Let me confirm: Rydberg constant R_H is about 1.097e4 m^-1. So the reciprocal would be in meters, so maybe in terms of wavelength, but that's specific to hydrogen transitions.

But de Broglie's formula is general for any massive particle, not just electrons in hydrogen. So the relation between momentum and wavelength is universal and uses h. So unless there's some other relation where Rydberg comes in, maybe in a specific case where they equate the kinetic energy with photon energy or something? Let's see. Suppose for an electron, the momentum p = sqrt(2mE), so if you have E = hc/λ, then p would be sqrt(2m hc/λ). But solving for λ would not give a direct relation with Rydberg. Alternatively, maybe in some older notation, but I don't recall.

Wait, maybe there's confusion between the Rydberg constant and the de Broglie wavelength? Let me check the units. The Rydberg constant has units of reciprocal length (m^-1) if it's in terms of wavelength. Planck's constant has units of J·s or kg·m²/s. Momentum is kg·m/s, so h divided by momentum (kg·m²/s divided by kg·m/s) gives meters, which matches wavelength. So units make sense for Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant's units, if it's in m^-1, then to get wavelength you take reciprocal, but that's not part of a formula involving momentum. 

Alternatively, if someone confused the Rydberg constant for the same as Planck's, but they are different. Planck's constant is h ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s, while Rydberg is about 1.097e7 m^-1. So they are different by orders of magnitude and have different units. 

Hmm, unless the question is referring to a specific equation in some textbook where they used Rydberg instead? Or maybe there was a translation error and "Rydberg" was mistakenly listed instead of "Planck"? Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, thinking of some other relation? 

Wait, let me think of the original de Broglie hypothesis. De Broglie's idea was that particles have wavelengths λ = h / p. So the constant is h, Planck's constant. So the answer must be A. But the user is saying the correct answer is C, Rydberg. Maybe the question is wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake?

Alternatively, maybe there's a context where another constant comes into play. For example, in quantum mechanics, sometimes constants are combined, like h-bar (ħ = h/(2π)). But that's still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship between momentum and wavelength in the context of the Rydberg formula? But the Rydberg formula is about photons emitted from atoms, not the particle's own wavelength. 

Wait, maybe if someone confuses the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(m c), but that's still using h. 

Alternatively, could there be a historical context where de Broglie used the Rydberg constant? I don't think so. De Broglie's work was in 1924, around the time Bohr's model was using the Rydberg constant, but de Broglie's relation is fundamental and general. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a multiple-choice trick where the options are mislabeled, but the user says the correct answer is C. Unless in some non-standard formulation... Wait, let me check the original question again to make sure I didn't misread.

The question is: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A to D with C being Rydberg. So unless the question is wrong? Because according to standard physics, de Broglie's relation uses Planck's constant. Maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship involving energy and wavelength, where E = hc/λ, so if you have E = p²/(2m), then combining gives p = sqrt(2mE) and substituting into λ gives λ = h / sqrt(2mE). But that still requires Planck's constant. Alternatively, if you express energy in terms of Rydberg's constant, but I don't see how. 

Alternatively, maybe in some specific units, like when wavelength is expressed in terms of the Rydberg unit of length? The Rydberg unit of length is approximately 0.529 Å, which is the Bohr radius. But that's a length, not a constant relating momentum and wavelength. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that de Broglie used the Rydberg constant in his derivation? I don't recall that. De Broglie's derivation was based on wave-particle duality, using Einstein's E=mc² and Planck's E=hf, leading to λ = h/p. 

Hmm, unless in some contexts the Rydberg constant is used as a proportionality constant in another equation? I can't think of any. Maybe the question is a trick, and the Rydberg constant is not the correct answer, but the user is confused? 

Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error from another language? For example, in some languages, the terms might be confused. 

Alternatively, the question might have a typo, and instead of Rydberg, it was supposed to be another constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled here. Let me see: the user lists the options as A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light. So if the question is really from an exam or a test, perhaps the correct answer is indeed C, but that would be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the wavelength-momentum relationship but something else. Wait, the question says "related by which of the following constants". So the relation is between p and λ, and the constant in between is the one they're asking for. 

The equation is λ = h / p. So h is the proportionality constant. So the answer is A. 

Alternatively, if they are considering the reciprocal, like p = h / λ, so same thing. 

Wait, perhaps the question is in another form, like energy and wavelength? Then E = pc for photons, but that's using c. But for matter waves, momentum p is related to wavelength via λ = h/p, so h is the constant. 

Alternatively, the question might be a distractor, trying to trick someone into choosing Rydberg because it's a constant in atomic physics, but that's incorrect. 

So I think the user might have been given this question where the correct answer is actually Planck's constant, but the user is confused because they were told the answer is C. But according to the standard physics, it's definitely Planck's constant. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question's wording? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a different relation, such as the quantization of angular momentum? Like in Bohr's model, angular momentum is quantized as nħ, but that uses h-bar (Planck's constant over 2π), so still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, if the question was about the energy levels of a particle confined in a box, the energy levels depend on n^2 h^2/(8 m L^2), but that's still h. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that the Rydberg constant is h/(2π m e^4), but that's more involved. The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c), which does involve h, but that's the Rydberg constant in terms of other constants, so the relation between p and λ is still through h. 

Hmm, I think I need to conclude that the question's correct answer is actually Planck's constant, so option A, and that there's either an error in the question or perhaps a trick. But since the user is asking why the correct answer is C, perhaps they have a different source? Maybe in some contexts or in the original question's source, they made a mistake?

Alternatively, maybe it's a different relation. Wait, is there any formula where Rydberg's constant is involved in the relation between momentum and wavelength? Let's see. The Rydberg constant in terms of wavelength is 1/λ = R*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). If we solve for λ, it's λ = 1/[R*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)]. But that's for photon wavelengths during electron transitions. 

Alternatively, maybe for an electron in the Bohr model, its momentum p = m v, and v is related to the Rydberg constant? The velocity in the Bohr model is v = α c, where α is the fine-structure constant. The fine structure constant is approximately 1/137, and R is related to α and c: R = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) which can be expressed in terms of α. But again, the direct relation between p and λ for a free particle is still through h. 

Alternatively, if someone is considering the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c). But that's using h and c. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the de Broglie wavelength expressed in terms of energy? Then λ = h/(sqrt(2 m E)). But even then, h is the constant. 

Alternatively, if the question was about the relationship between momentum and wavelength in the context of the photoelectric effect, but that involves the photon's energy, which is E_photon = h f, but again, Planck's constant. 

Hmm, I can't find any relation where Rydberg's constant is the proportionality constant between momentum and wavelength for a free particle. The Rydberg constant is specific to hydrogen-like atoms. 

Therefore, I think the question is either incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. The correct answer based on standard physics is Planck’s constant (A), so the user might have encountered an error in their source. Alternatively, maybe the question had a different wording that led to Rydberg, but with the given information, I can't see how. 

Perhaps the original question had a different setup, but as presented here, the answer should be A. Therefore, the user might have been given incorrect information, or there's a trick. But unless there's some other context, I can't justify Rydberg as the answer.
</think>

The correct answer to the question as posed is **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie proposed that the wavelength \( \lambda \) of a free massive particle is inversely proportional to its linear momentum \( p \). The relationship is given by the equation:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p},
   \]  
   where \( h \) is **Planck’s constant**. This equation establishes the fundamental connection between momentum and wavelength for matter waves.

2. **Rationale for Other Constants**:  
   - **Boltzmann’s constant (\( k_B \))**: Relates energy and temperature in statistical mechanics. Irrelevant here.  
   - **Rydberg constant (\( R \))**: Governs the wavelengths of hydrogen spectral lines (\( \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) \)), but is specific to atomic transitions, not general particle-wave duality.  
   - **Speed of light (\( c \))**: Relates energy and momentum for photons (\( E = pc \)), but does not appear in the de Broglie formula for massive particles.  

3. **Why the Rydberg Constant is Incorrect**:  
   The Rydberg constant is tied to the quantized energy levels of hydrogen atoms and does not directly relate momentum and wavelength for a free particle. The equation \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \) uses **Planck’s constant** (h), making **A** the correct answer.

### Conclusion:
The assertion that the Rydberg constant (C) is the correct answer is **incorrect**. This is likely a mistake in the question’s options or a misinterpretation. The proper constant linking momentum and wavelength in de Broglie’s hypothesis is **Planck’s constant** (A). 

**Final Answer:**  
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. The confusion with the Rydberg constant likely arises from its role in atomic physics (e.g., hydrogen spectra), which is unrelated to the general wave-particle duality described by de Broglie.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I came across this multiple-choice question about De Broglie's hypothesis, and I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer should be Planck's constant. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle according to De Broglie. The options are Planck’s constant (A), Boltzmann’s constant (B), the Rydberg constant (C), and the speed of light (D). The given correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, but I'm not sure why that would be the case. 

I remember that De Broglie's equation is wavelength equals Planck's constant divided by momentum. That formula is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. So that would suggest the answer is A, Planck’s constant. But the question says the correct answer is C, which is the Rydberg constant. That's conflicting with what I recall. Maybe I'm missing something here?

Let me double-check De Broglie's work. Louis de Broglie proposed in his 1924 thesis that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. The key relation he came up with was indeed λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant. So that definitely ties the wavelength to momentum via Planck's constant. 

The Rydberg constant, on the other hand, is related to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. It's used in the Rydberg formula to determine the wavelengths of spectral lines. The formula is 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant. So that's about atomic transitions, not directly about the wavelength-momentum relationship for particles.

Boltzmann's constant (k) is used in statistical mechanics, relating energy of particles in a gas to temperature, like in the equation E = (3/2)kT. It doesn't directly relate momentum and wavelength either.

The speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant, but it's part of equations like E=mc² or in the context of electromagnetic waves, c = λν. But in the De Broglie equation, unless they're considering relativistic effects, which I don't think is the case here, the speed of light isn't part of that formula.

Wait a second, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Could there be a different formulation where the Rydberg constant is involved? Let me think. The Rydberg constant is approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1. Planck's constant is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The units of Rydberg is inverse meters, and Planck's is J·s, so their units are different. De Broglie's equation has wavelength (meters) on one side, and h (J·s) over momentum (kg·m/s), so units would be (J·s)/(kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s²·s)/(kg·m/s) ) = (kg·m³/s³)/(kg·m/s)) = m. So that works. The Rydberg constant has units of 1/m, so that's different. So the units don't match if the question is about relating momentum and wavelength through a constant. The Rydberg constant's units are different, so it can't be in that equation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So the constants given are A to D. The relation is λ = h/p, so h is Planck's constant. Therefore the correct answer must be A. 

Wait, maybe the question is referring to a different version of the equation? Let me check if there's another constant involved in De Broglie's relation. The standard equation is indeed λ = h/p. But sometimes in some contexts, especially when dealing with relativistic particles, the equation can involve the rest mass and energy, but even then, the fundamental constant is still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question's answer key? Perhaps the options were mixed up. Or maybe the question is a trick question where they expect the student to think of another constant. But I just can't see how the Rydberg constant would be involved here. The Rydberg constant is for the hydrogen spectrum, not for matter waves. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some formulations using angular momentum? Wait, De Broglie also talked about standing waves around the nucleus, but that led to quantization conditions, but even then, the Rydberg constant comes from combining several constants including Planck's. For example, the Rydberg constant R_H is equal to (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀²h³c), so it's a combination of fundamental constants. But that's probably beyond the basic question here. The question is about the direct relation between momentum and wavelength, which is h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was supposed to refer to energy and wavelength, but even then, the relation would involve Planck's constant as E = hc/λ, but that's for photons. For particles, their energy is related to momentum via kinetic energy equations, but the direct De Broglie relation is λ = h/p. 

Alternatively, could there be confusion with the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(m c), which is a constant related to a particle's mass. But that's not directly the same as the De Broglie wavelength, which depends on the momentum. The Compton wavelength is a specific case when the particle is at rest, but De Broglie's wavelength is general. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in another context, like solid-state physics or something else, but I don't think so. The standard De Broglie wavelength is h over p. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question? Or maybe the original question had a different wording? Let me check again. The user says: "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A to D. The user states the correct answer is C (Rydberg). But that's conflicting with standard physics. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where the student is supposed to think of the formula in terms of energy and wavelength, but even then, using E = p^2/(2m) and E = hc/λ, you can combine them to get p = sqrt(2 m E) but that still uses Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the wave number (k) instead of wavelength? The wave number is 2π/λ, so k = 2π p / h. But even so, the constant involved is still h (or ħ if using reduced Planck's constant). 

Alternatively, could there be confusion between the de Broglie wavelength formula and the Rydberg formula? For instance, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ = m e r^2 ω = L, leading to the quantization of orbits. The Rydberg constant comes from the energy levels which are derived from that. But the de Broglie wavelength is a different concept, though related in that it was inspired by the Bohr model's quantization. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect? Because I can't see how Rydberg's constant would be the answer here. If the question is from a test or a textbook, maybe there was a typo? Like if the question intended to ask about the energy levels of hydrogen, then the answer would be Rydberg. But as stated, it's about momentum and wavelength of a free particle, so Planck's constant is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe in some non-SI units or a different form of the equation? But even then, the fundamental constant would still be Planck's. 

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see if I can find any references. Searching for De Broglie wavelength formula: Yes, it's λ = h / p. So the constant is Planck's. 

Therefore, unless there is a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing, the correct answer should be A. Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant is not part of that relation, so the provided answer might be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the relationship between momentum and wavelength for photons? But even then, the photon's energy is E = pc, so wavelength λ = hc/E, but again Planck's constant is involved. 

Wait a minute, could there be a confusion with the Rydberg constant in the context of wavelength of electron transitions? For example, in the formula for the wavelength of the emitted photon when an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the Rydberg constant comes into play. But that's a different scenario than a free particle's wavelength. 

Alternatively, if the question was about the relationship between the momentum and the wave number (k), then k = p/(ħ), so ħ is the reduced Planck constant, but that's still Planck's constant divided by 2π. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was translated incorrectly, and "Rydberg constant" was meant to be another term. 

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, the Rydberg constant is used in combination with other constants to form a relation, but I can't recall such a case. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and the test-taker is supposed to recognize that none of the options are correct except A, but the stated answer is C, so the user is confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Rydberg constant is involved in some way when relating wavelength to momentum in a specific context like in the Bohr model? Let's think. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ, and the radius of the orbit is r = n² ε₀ h²/(π m e²). From that, the energy levels are derived, leading to the Rydberg formula. But again, that's building on the Planck constant, not directly using the Rydberg constant in the momentum-wavelength relation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly formulated. The Rydberg constant is related to the inverse wavelength (as in 1/λ = R(...)), so perhaps if the question had said "reciprocal of the wavelength" or something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-physics context? Like chemistry, but even in chemistry the De Broglie equation is h/p. 

Hmm, maybe the user needs to check the original question again or the source of the question. It might be a mistake in the question's answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled? Like the actual correct answer is A, but the provided answer is C. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relationship in terms of energy? Let me see, if E = p²/(2m) for non-relativistic particles, and then if you set that equal to the photon energy, E = hc/λ, then you can write λ = 2 m c h / p², but then that still involves h and c, but that's a different relation. However, that equation isn't the standard De Broglie wavelength. 

Alternatively, if you consider relativistic energy, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², but that complicates things further. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a historical one? De Broglie might have used a different constant in his original derivation? Let me check. 

Looking up De Broglie's original work, he postulated that the wavelength λ = h / p, and the frequency f = E / h. So yes, Planck's constant is fundamental here. The Rydberg constant isn't part of that. 

Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question's answer. The correct answer should be A, Planck's constant. The Rydberg constant is not related to De Broglie's wavelength-momentum relationship. Unless there's some other context or a trick I'm missing, but I can't see it. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the constant that relates the linear momentum to wavelength squared or something else? Let me check the wording again: "related by which of the following constants". So the equation must be λ = (constant)/p, so the constant is h. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a multiple constants question? Like h divided by something else, but no, the formula is straight h over p. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different unit system where Rydberg is used, but that's a stretch. 

I think I have to conclude that either the question is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Unless the Rydberg constant is being confused with something else. Maybe in some textbooks they combine constants... but I can't recall any such case. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from an incorrect source? For instance, maybe someone confused the Rydberg constant with Planck's? 

Alternatively, maybe the original question was about the Rydberg formula, but the user mistyped it? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the de Broglie wavelength for an electron in a crystal lattice, but that still uses the same h/p relation. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only logical conclusion is that the provided answer is wrong. The correct answer is A, Planck’s constant. The Rydberg constant (C) is not the right answer here. So perhaps there was an error in the question or the answer key.
</think>

The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's why:

### Key Points:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   Louis de Broglie proposed that the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a free massive particle is inversely proportional to its linear momentum (\(p\)). The fundamental relationship is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, **\(h\)** is **Planck’s constant**. This equation directly ties wavelength and momentum through Planck’s constant.  

2. **Role of the Rydberg Constant**:  
   The Rydberg constant (\(R_H\)) is unrelated to this relationship. It is used in the Rydberg formula to describe the wavelengths of spectral lines in the hydrogen atom:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]  
   The Rydberg constant arises from quantum mechanical calculations involving the Bohr model and combines multiple physical constants (including Planck’s constant), but it does **not** directly relate momentum and wavelength for a free particle.

3. **Other Constants**:  
   - **Boltzmann’s constant** (\(k_B\)) relates energy to temperature, not momentum to wavelength.  
   - **Speed of light** (\(c\)) is relevant for photons (\(E = hc/\lambda\)), but the question specifies a *massive particle*, not a photon.  

### Why the Answer "C" Is Incorrect:
The Rydberg constant is specific to atomic transitions in hydrogen. The question explicitly asks about the relationship between **momentum and wavelength for a free massive particle**, which is governed by de Broglie’s equation and Planck’s constant. The Rydberg constant is extraneous here.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**. The confusion might arise from conflating the Rydberg constant (which applies to atomic spectra) with Planck’s constant (which underpins wave-particle duality). The provided answer "C" is likely an error.  

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{A}
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about de Broglie's hypothesis regarding the relationship between a free massive particle's linear momentum and its wavelength. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, the Rydberg constant, and the speed of light. The question says the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, but I'm confused because I remember de Broglie's equation involves Planck's constant. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to recall de Broglie's hypothesis. From what I learned in my physics class, Louis de Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. The key equation he came up with relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum. The equation is λ = h / p, where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum of the particle. That formula definitely uses Planck's constant, not Rydberg's. So, according to this, the answer should be A, Planck’s constant. But the question says the correct answer is C. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps there's a trick in the question? Let me read the question again carefully: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So it's asking which constant relates them. The equation I know is λ = h/p, so h is Planck's constant. That would point to answer A. But the user is saying the correct answer is C. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, could the question be referring to a different form of the equation or a different constant that's sometimes used in related contexts? Let me think about the other constants listed. Boltzmann's constant (k) is related to thermal energy, like in the equation for temperature and kinetic energy (like (3/2)kT = (1/2)m v²). That doesn't seem related to de Broglie's wavelength. The speed of light (c) is involved in relativity and photon energy (E=hc/λ), but again, de Broglie's equation for matter waves isn't directly using c unless it's relativistic momentum. But the question specifies a free massive particle, so non-relativistic might be the case here.

Then there's the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg constant (R) is typically associated with the Rydberg formula for atomic spectra, like the wavelengths of hydrogen's spectral lines: 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). That's used in the context of light emitted when electrons transition between energy levels. Not sure how that connects to de Broglie's hypothesis. Unless there's a different version of the equation that uses Rydberg's constant, but I can't recall such a thing.

Wait a second, maybe there's a mix-up between the two? If someone confuses de Broglie's equation with the Rydberg formula, they might mistakenly think the Rydberg constant is involved. But according to standard physics, de Broglie's relation uses Planck's constant. Is there any scenario where Rydberg's constant comes into play here?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different formulation or an older version? I know that sometimes constants can have different definitions or scaled versions. For example, sometimes people use h-bar (ħ = h/(2π)) in equations, but that's still Planck's constant divided by 2π. The Rydberg constant is a different physical constant altogether. Let me check the values: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, while the Rydberg constant is about 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1. They are different in both value and context.

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between wavelength of light and matter waves? The Rydberg constant is indeed related to the wavelength of light emitted or absorbed during electron transitions, but that's a different phenomenon. De Broglie's wavelength is about matter particles, like electrons, having wave properties. So the constants involved are different.

Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased in a tricky way? Let me parse the question again exactly: "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So it's saying the relationship between p and λ uses which constant. Since λ = h/p, then h is the constant that relates them, so answer A. Unless the question is referring to a historical context where de Broglie used a different constant?

Wait, maybe de Broglie originally expressed his hypothesis in terms of the Rydberg constant? Let me check the original de Broglie equation. Quick search in my memory: de Broglie's original work in 1924, he proposed that the wavelength λ is equal to h over the relativistic momentum mv, where h is Planck's constant. So that equation is indeed using Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Is it possible that the question is incorrect? Or maybe I'm missing some context. Let me think about the options again:

A. Planck’s constant – which is h.

B. Boltzmann’s constant – k.

C. The Rydberg constant – R.

D. The speed of light – c.

If the question is correct and the answer is C, that must mean there's an error in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different context where Rydberg's constant is involved? For example, sometimes constants can be expressed in terms of others, but I don't see how Rydberg's constant would be involved in the de Broglie equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was misprinted, and the intended answer was A, but they said C by mistake. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the relationship between energy and wavelength, but even then, the de Broglie wavelength is about momentum, not energy.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength of a particle is h/(m c), which involves both Planck's constant and the speed of light, but that's a specific case for photons interacting with particles. The Compton wavelength is different from the general de Broglie wavelength, which is h/p, so again, Planck's constant.

Alternatively, could there be an alternative formulation using the Rydberg constant in some way? Let me think: The Rydberg constant is connected to the energy levels in the hydrogen atom, which are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_n = -R_H * hc / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. But how would that relate to de Broglie's wavelength?

If we consider an electron in a hydrogen atom, its de Broglie wavelength would relate to its momentum, but the energy levels involve the Rydberg constant. However, the direct relationship between momentum and wavelength is still through h, not R. The Rydberg constant comes into play when considering the quantization of energy levels, which involve both the de Broglie wavelength and the boundary conditions of the atom, but the fundamental relation between p and λ is still h.

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the wave number and the wavelength? The wave number k is 2π/λ, and sometimes equations use angular frequency instead of frequency. But even so, the fundamental connection is through h, not another constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different version of the formula? For example, in some contexts, the Rydberg constant is expressed in terms of h, but that's not its definition. The Rydberg constant is a measured value, related to the Bohr model parameters, like the Bohr radius, electron mass, charge, and Planck's constant. But that's an indirect relation.

Wait, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ = m v r, so that involves ħ (h-bar). The Rydberg constant is derived from these parameters. But again, the direct relation for de Broglie's wavelength is λ = h/p, so h is the key constant. So unless there's a specific derivation where Rydberg's constant is used, which I can't see, the answer should be A.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the Rydberg constant is involved in the energy levels, which in turn affect the momentum of the electron, so indirectly? But that seems too convoluted. The question is about the direct relationship between momentum and wavelength, not about energy levels or atomic structure.

Wait, perhaps the question was translated incorrectly or the options are mixed up. If the original question had a different set of options, but in this case, given the options here, I can't see why it would be the Rydberg constant. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the proportionality constant in the equation, and in some contexts, it's presented as a different constant. But according to standard physics textbooks, de Broglie's wavelength is h over p, so Planck's constant is the correct answer.

Hmm, I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to verify with another angle. Let's consider each option in turn.

Planck's constant h: As per de Broglie's equation, yes, directly involved.

Boltzmann's constant k: This relates energy to temperature, like in thermal energy (E = (3/2)kT). Doesn't directly relate to momentum-wavelength.

Rydberg constant R: As in 1/λ = R(1/n² - 1/m²), so relates to spectral lines, not matter waves.

Speed of light c: Part of E=mc² and E=pc for photons, but de Broglie's formula for matter particles (non-relativistic) is λ = h/p, not involving c.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. So why does the question say C? There must be a mistake here. Alternatively, the question might have been miswritten. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question?

Wait the question says "the linear momentum and wavelength are related by which of the following constants". The equation is λ = h/p, so h is the constant that relates them. Therefore, the answer must be A. So unless there's a context where Rydberg's constant is used instead, which I can't recall, the answer is wrong in the question's options. Maybe the original question had a different context?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different relationship where Rydberg comes into play? For example, in the context of the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ = m v r. The radius of the nth orbit is proportional to n², and the energy levels are proportional to 1/n², leading to the Rydberg formula. But even here, the relation between momentum and wavelength would still use h.

Alternatively, perhaps in some older textbooks or different formulations, they express the de Broglie wavelength using the Rydberg constant? Let me think of any possible derivation.

Suppose we consider the energy levels in hydrogen: E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The momentum of the electron in the nth orbit would be related to its kinetic energy, which is proportional to 1/n². The de Broglie wavelength would then depend on that momentum, and since the energy levels also involve the Rydberg constant, maybe there's a connection. But even then, the direct proportionality between λ and p still requires h.

Alternatively, if someone were to write the de Broglie wavelength in terms of the Rydberg constant, it would be a convoluted expression. Let me see: Let's suppose E_n = -R_H * hc / n². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = -E_n (since total energy is -ke²/(2r), so KE is half the magnitude). Then momentum p = mv. So p = sqrt(2mE), but here E is the kinetic energy. Let me plug in E_n:

E_n = -R_H hc / n² ⇒ KE = |E_n| = R_H hc / n².

Thus, p = sqrt(2m * R_H hc / n² )

Then, the de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p = h / sqrt(2m R_H hc / n² ) ⇒ h divided by sqrt term.

Simplifying: sqrt(2m R_H hc / n² ) = sqrt(2m R_H h c) / n

So λ = h * n / sqrt(2m R_H h c )

But this is getting too involved. The point is, even here, the Rydberg constant is part of the expression, but the fundamental relation between p and λ is still through h. The Rydberg constant comes into play because of the specific energy levels in hydrogen, but it's not the constant that directly relates p and λ in the general de Broglie hypothesis.

Therefore, unless the question is specifically about electrons in a hydrogen atom and the wavelength relates to their orbital momentum and the Rydberg constant, which would be a stretch, I can't see the Rydberg constant being correct here. The standard de Broglie formula is h over p, so the answer must be A.

Therefore, I think there's an error in the question's provided answer. The correct answer should be A. Planck’s constant. The Rydberg constant is not related to the de Broglie wavelength formula. Perhaps the question intended to ask about something else, like the Rydberg formula or another relation where that constant is used, but as it stands, the correct answer is Planck's constant.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**, not C. The Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**: 
   - Louis de Broglie proposed that **all matter particles** (e.g., electrons) exhibit wave-like properties. The relationship between a particle’s **linear momentum (\(p\))** and its **wavelength (\(\lambda\))** is given by:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
     \]
   - Here, **\(h\)** is **Planck’s constant**, which directly relates momentum and wavelength. 

2. **Why the Rydberg Constant (C) is Incorrect**:
   - The **Rydberg constant (\(R_H\))** is associated with the **spectral lines of hydrogen atoms**, specifically in the **Rydberg formula**:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
     \]
   - This constant quantifies **energy transitions** between quantized electron orbits in atoms, not the wave-particle duality of free particles. It has no direct role in the general de Broglie relationship.

3. **Other Constants**:
   - **Boltzmann’s constant (\(k_B\))** relates thermal energy to temperature and is irrelevant here.
   - **The speed of light (\(c\))** appears in relativistic equations (e.g., \(E=pc\) for photons) but is not part of the **non-relativistic de Broglie relation**.

### Conclusion:
The question likely contains an error. The correct constant linking momentum and wavelength in de Broglie’s hypothesis is **Planck’s constant (A)**. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated and belongs to atomic spectroscopy, not wave-particle duality.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{A} (Planck’s constant is correct; the Rydberg constant is a mistake in the question's provided answer.)
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, for the De Broglie hypothesis question. Wait, hold on. I remember that De Broglie's equation relates momentum and wavelength. Let me recall... I think it's lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant. So that would mean the constant involved is Planck's constant, which is option A. But the question says the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something here?

Let me think again. De Broglie's hypothesis states that particles have wave-like properties, and the wavelength associated with a particle is given by lambda = h / (mv), where h is Planck's constant, m is mass, and v is velocity. So the momentum p is mv, so indeed lambda = h/p. Therefore, the constant here is Planck's constant. So why would the answer be Rydberg? Maybe there's a trick in the question?

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are Planck's, Boltzmann's, Rydberg's, or speed of light. 

Hmm, so the question is asking which constant is used in the relationship between momentum and wavelength. Since the formula is lambda = h / p, that would be Planck's constant. But the user says the correct answer is C, Rydberg. Maybe there's a mistake here? Or maybe I'm forgetting something?

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a different context where Rydberg's constant is involved. Let me recall: the Rydberg constant is related to the energy levels of hydrogen atoms, right? It's used in the Rydberg formula for the spectral lines: 1/lambda = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²). But that's for electromagnetic radiation, not for particles' de Broglie wavelength. 

Alternatively, could there be confusion between different constants? Let me think. The speed of light is c, Boltzmann's is k, Planck's h or ħ (h-bar), and Rydberg R. The de Broglie wavelength uses h, so planck's. 

Wait, is there a version where Rydberg is used instead? Maybe in some specific cases? Or perhaps the question was misworded? Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in a different context? For example, in relativity? But the de Broglie equation is non-relativistic. Even in relativity, the momentum would still involve h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up constants. For example, sometimes people confuse Rydberg with other constants. But no, the Rydberg constant is specifically for atomic transitions. 

Wait, let me check the actual formula again. De Broglie's wavelength is lambda = h / p. So the constant is h, so answer A. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake in saying the correct answer is C. Or perhaps the original question had a typo? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about energy levels? Like, if you have the energy related to momentum, but even then, the Rydberg constant relates to energy levels in the hydrogen atom, so E_n = -R_H * hc / n². But that's different. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a distractor, and the options are tricky. For example, maybe some people confuse the Rydberg constant with Planck's because both are constants in physics? But in the actual equation, it's definitely Planck's constant. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question's wording. If it says "related by which constant", maybe they're referring to the proportionality constant in the equation. Since lambda is inversely proportional to momentum, the proportionality constant is h. So again Planck's. 

Alternatively, could there be a different version of the equation that uses another constant? Let's see: sometimes the reduced Planck constant ħ is used, so lambda = h/(mv) = ħ/( (mv)/ħ * ħ )? Wait, no, maybe I'm complicating. 

Alternatively, if someone thought that energy and wavelength were related via E = hc/lambda, but that's for photons. De Broglie's for matter waves uses p, not E. 

Hmm, this is confusing. The user is insistent that the correct answer is C, but according to my knowledge, it's A. Maybe the question is wrong, or there's a trick. Let me check online quickly... 

Wait, I can't access the internet, but based on my memory, De Broglie's relation uses Planck's constant. So the answer should be A. The Rydberg constant is for atomic spectra. Therefore, unless the question is incorrect, or there's some context I'm missing, I think the correct answer is Planck's constant, so A. Maybe the user made a mistake in stating the answer? 

Alternatively, perhaps in some textbooks or sources, they present it differently? Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe the question is from an older text where constants were combined? For example, the Rydberg constant is related to h, c, and the mass of the electron. 

Yes, actually, the Rydberg constant R_H is equal to (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀²h³c) or something like that. So it's composed of Planck's constant, but that's not the same as saying the relation between p and lambda uses Rydberg. 

Alternatively, if the question is asking about the constant that relates the momentum and wavelength in terms of another derived constant, but that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is confusion between the wave number and wavelength. The wave number k is 2π/lambda, and sometimes in physics, especially with photons, you have k = p/(ħ), but that still involves h-bar (Planck's constant over 2π). 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they refer to the Rydberg constant because it's in wave-related physics, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about the relation between momentum and frequency? But even then, frequency would relate to energy, and E = h f, so f = E/h, but then E = p^2/(2m) for non-relativistic, so f = p²/(2m h). Still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, the question could have a typo and the correct answer is A, but the user says C. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship in a particular system, like in the Bohr model? 

In Bohr's model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, which relates to h, so Planck's constant again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Rydberg constant in the sense that when you calculate the wavelength of an electron in a hydrogen atom, the Rydberg constant comes into play, but that's a different scenario. 

Wait, let me think about the de Broglie wavelength of an electron in the Bohr model. The momentum of the electron is mv, and the radius is nλ/(2π), because the circumference is an integer multiple of the wavelength. So, mv * r = nħ => p * r = nħ. But solving for the wavelength, lambda = 2πr / n. So, in that case, but still the key constant is ħ, which is Planck's constant over 2π. 

Hmm, unless the question combines some constants and the Rydberg constant is involved. Let me see the formula for Rydberg: R_H = 1.097e4 m^-1, and it's given by R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀² h³ c) or similar. So if you were to derive the de Broglie wavelength in a scenario involving the Rydberg constant, but that seems indirect. 

Alternatively, maybe someone confused the Rydberg's constant with the Compton wavelength? But Compton wavelength is h/(m c), so that's Planck's constant again. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong. Since De Broglie's equation uses Planck's constant, the answer should be A. Therefore, I think there must be an error in the question or the provided answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original question had different options. Maybe the user mistyped option C as Rydberg instead of Planck? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the inverse relation, like momentum related to wavelength via another constant. 

Wait, let me check the original question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The key here is "related by which constant". The formula is lambda = h / p, so the constant is h. 

Alternatively, if the question wanted the momentum in terms of wavelength, then p = h / lambda, so same thing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in another language and there was a translation error? For example, in some languages, constants might have different names? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relativistic version? Then p = gamma m v, but the de Broglie wavelength is still h over p, so the constant remains h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a distractor where the user is supposed to eliminate other options. Boltzmann's constant is for thermal physics, speed of light is in relativity and EM, Rydberg in atomic spectra. So eliminating those, only Planck's makes sense. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A, Planck's constant. Unless there is some other context I'm unaware of. Since the user claims it's C, I might need to point out the discrepancy. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about energy levels and momentum, but even then, the Rydberg constant is tied to energy transitions, not directly to momentum and wavelength. 

Hmm, I can't think of any scenario where the Rydberg constant would be used in the de Broglie relation. Therefore, I believe the correct answer should be A, Planck's constant, but there might be a mistake in the question's provided answer.
</think>

The correct answer to the question about the relationship between the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle proposed by de Broglie is **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Concepts:
1. **De Broglie Hypothesis**: Louis de Broglie proposed that particles exhibit wave-like behavior, with the associated wavelength given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength, \( h \) is **Planck’s constant**, and \( p \) is the linear momentum of the particle. This equation directly ties momentum and wavelength through **Planck’s constant** (\( h \)).

2. **Rydberg Constant**: The Rydberg constant (\( R_H \)) is specific to atomic physics and describes the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen-like atoms. It relates to energy transitions between quantized electron orbitals and is given by:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]
   This constant is unrelated to the de Broglie wavelength formula for a free massive particle.

3. **Other Constants**:
   - **Boltzmann’s constant** (\( k_B \)) is used in thermodynamics (e.g., relating thermal energy and temperature).
   - **Speed of light** (\( c \)) appears in relativity and electromagnetism, but not in the de Broglie equation for non-relativistic particles.

### Why the Rydberg Constant (C) Is Incorrect:
- The Rydberg constant is tied to **atomic spectral lines**, not to the wave-particle duality of **free particles**. Confusion might arise if the question conflates atomic spectra with de Broglie’s hypothesis, but this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the two concepts.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A. Planck’s constant**, as it is the constant explicitly featured in de Broglie’s equation. The Rydberg constant (C) is unrelated to this relationship. If the question states that C is correct, it likely contains an error or mislabeling. Always verify the de Broglie equation as \( \lambda = h/p \), which uses Planck’s constant.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question here about De Broglie's hypothesis and which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, the Rydberg constant, and the speed of light. The user says the correct answer is C, the Rydberg constant, but I thought it was Planck’s constant. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. The key formula I recall is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum. That would make me think the answer is A, Planck’s constant. But the question says the correct answer is C. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing constants. De Broglie's equation is indeed λ = h/p. So that's straightforward. So Planck's constant is involved here. But why would the answer be Rydberg constant?

Maybe there's a trick in the question wording. Let me re-read the question: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So they're asking which constant is used in the relationship between momentum and wavelength. The equation is definitely λ = h/p, so h is Planck's constant. 

But perhaps in some contexts, Rydberg's constant is used in a different formula? The Rydberg constant is related to atomic spectra, specifically the wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms. The formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant. That's different from De Broglie's equation. 

Is there a situation where De Broglie's wavelength might be connected to the Rydberg constant? Maybe in some specific application? Let me think. The de Broglie wavelength of an electron in a hydrogen atom could be related to the Rydberg constant through the energy levels? For example, the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -R_H * hc / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. But De Broglie's wavelength is still h/p. The momentum p of the electron in the nth orbit would be related to its energy, so combining these could involve both constants, but the direct relationship between p and λ is h. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Let me check the constants again:

Planck's constant (h): relates energy and frequency (E = h f) and momentum and wavelength (λ = h/p).

Boltzmann's constant (k): relates energy and temperature in thermodynamics (E = (3/2)kT for ideal gases, etc.), so not directly related here.

Rydberg constant (R): as mentioned, related to the wavelengths of spectral lines.

Speed of light (c): relates energy and frequency in E=hf and E=pc for photons, but for massive particles, c isn't part of De Broglie's equation.

Hmm, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly? Or maybe there's confusion between different constants. Let me check the original question again. It says "related by which of the following constants". The formula is λ = h/p, so the constant is h, Planck's constant. So the correct answer should be A, not C. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps there's a different interpretation?

Wait another thought: sometimes the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h/(2π)) is used in some equations, but even then, the question lists Planck's constant as an option, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Alternatively, maybe in some historical context, De Broglie used a different constant? But no, De Broglie's relation is fundamentally h. The Rydberg constant was introduced later by Rydberg to explain spectral lines, but that's a different concept. 

Alternatively, could the question be referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c), which involves the speed of light, but that's a different relation. The Compton effect is about photons scattering off particles, but that's not De Broglie's hypothesis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a non-physics context where they mixed up terms? Or maybe a mistranslation in the question? 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a test where the options were mislabeled? Like maybe in the original source, the answer key had a typo? Because based on standard physics, the answer must be A. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick where they are considering relativistic momentum? But even then, De Broglie's equation is still λ = h/p, where p is the relativistic momentum, so the constant is still h. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different version of the formula? For example, sometimes the wavelength is written as λ = h/(mv), so if the question is considering mass and velocity instead of momentum, but the question specifically mentions linear momentum, so p is already the momentum. 

Wait, let me check the actual De Broglie hypothesis again. His key idea was that particles have wavelengths inversely proportional to their momentum, with the proportionality constant being Planck's constant divided by 2π? Wait, no. Wait, De Broglie's original proposal was λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. So that's the formula. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be Planck's constant, option A. The Rydberg constant is not involved here. Maybe the user is confused because another formula uses that constant, but in the context of De Broglie's relation, it's definitely Planck's constant. 

Unless there's some other aspect... Maybe in some units or equations involving the Rydberg constant indirectly? Wait, the Rydberg constant is related to the ionization energy of hydrogen, which is 13.6 eV, and the Rydberg constant R = 1.097e4 m^-1. The de Broglie wavelength of an electron with that kinetic energy... Hmm, let's see, if an electron has kinetic energy equal to the ionization energy, then using K = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mK). Then λ = h/p = h / sqrt(2mK). Plugging in K = 13.6 eV, but that still doesn't involve the Rydberg constant directly. The Rydberg constant R is related to 1/λ, but not in the same equation as momentum and wavelength. 

Alternatively, combining De Broglie's formula with the hydrogen atom's energy levels? The energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n², so the kinetic energy is related to n, but the momentum p would be sqrt(2m|E_n|). Then the de Broglie wavelength would be h / p. But even then, the Rydberg constant would come into play through the energy, but the direct relation between p and λ is still via h. 

Alternatively, maybe in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, but again, that's a different constant (ħ is h-bar), but the question lists Planck's constant as an option, so that's still h. 

Wait, perhaps the user or the original question is from a non-English source where terms got mistranslated? Or maybe it's a deliberately trick question? 

Alternatively, could "linear momentum and wavelength are related by the Rydberg constant" in some way? Let's see: If you rearrange the Rydberg formula, maybe... The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). If n₁ is infinity, then it's the ionization limit, so 1/λ = R(1/0 - 1/n₂²) but that's not really. Alternatively, maybe in transition between energy levels, but that's not directly about a free particle. 

Wait the question specifies "a free massive particle". The Rydberg constant is about bound particles in atoms. So the question is about a free particle, so Rydberg's constant is not involved. 

Hmm, so unless there's a misunderstanding in the question, I can't see how Rydberg's constant is correct here. The only possible way is if the question is incorrect, or if there's a different interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which constant is *not* related, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the original question had different options? For instance, if the options were misordered, and the user thought C was Planck's constant, but in the original it was different. Or perhaps they misread the options. 

Alternatively, the question might be incorrectly attributing the relation to the Rydberg constant, perhaps due to confusing De Broglie's work with the Rydberg's contribution to spectral lines. 

In any case, based on standard physics, De Broglie's relation is λ = h/p, so the constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. The Rydberg constant is not involved here. 

I think the user might have made a mistake in stating that the correct answer is C. Perhaps the original test question had a different context or there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some obscure connection here, but I can't think of any. 

So, my conclusion is that the correct answer should be A. Planck’s constant, and the Rydberg constant is not the right answer here. Therefore, the user might have an error in their question's answer key.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**, not the Rydberg constant. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Analysis:
1. **De Broglie's Hypothesis**:  
   De Broglie proposed that particles exhibit wave-like behavior, with the relationship between a particle's linear momentum (\( p \)) and its wavelength (\( \lambda \)) given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
   \]  
   Here, \( h \) is **Planck's constant**, making it the correct choice.

2. **Rydberg Constant (Option C)**:  
   The Rydberg constant (\( R \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \)) is associated with the wavelengths of atomic spectral lines (e.g., in the hydrogen atom), described by the formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
   \]  
   This is unrelated to De Broglie's wave-particle relationship for free particles.

3. **Other Constants**:
   - **Boltzmann’s constant (\( k \))**: Relates energy and temperature, not momentum-wavelength.
   - **Speed of light (\( c \))**: Relevant to photons or relativistic energy-momentum, but not the direct De Broglie relation for massive particles.

### Why the Rydberg Constant Is Incorrect:
The question specifically asks about a *free massive particle*, where the Rydberg constant (applicable to bound atomic electrons) plays no role. The direct relationship \( \lambda \propto 1/p \) is **solely dependent on Planck’s constant** (\( h \)).

### Conclusion:
The answer **C (Rydberg constant)** is incorrect. The correct answer is **A (Planck’s constant)**. The confusion might arise from conflating De Broglie’s hypothesis with atomic spectral lines or a misattributed answer key. Always verify the fundamental equations: De Broglie’s formula explicitly uses Planck’s constant. 

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{A}
[overthinking]
Okay, so there's this question about de Broglie and the constants related to momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's, Boltzmann's, Rydberg, or the speed of light. The user says the answer is C, Rydberg, but I'm confused because I thought de Broglie used Planck's constant. Let me think through this again.

First, de Broglie's hypothesis is that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. The key equation I remember is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum. So that would mean Planck's constant is the one involved here. That would make the answer A. So why does the question say the answer is C?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the question again. It says "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So the relation between p and lambda is lambda = h/(mv), but the question is about the constant involved. The equation uses h, Planck's constant, so answer A should be correct. 

Hmm, maybe there's a trick here. Let me consider the other constants. Boltzmann's constant is used in thermodynamics, like in the ideal gas law PV = NkT. The Rydberg constant is related to atomic spectra, specifically the energy levels of hydrogen atoms. The speed of light is c, part of relativity and E=mc², but also in photon energy equations like E=hf. 

Wait a second, maybe the question is a trick question? Or perhaps there was a misprint? Because de Broglie's formula is definitely lambda = h/p. So Planck's constant is the key. But Rydberg is for spectral lines. Unless the question is referring to some other relation?

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different form. Let me think again. De Broglie's equation is wavelength = h / (momentum). So the constant linking them is h, Planck's. So answer A. 

Is there any scenario where Rydberg's constant would be involved here? The Rydberg constant comes into play in the Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms: 1/lambda = R*(1/n² - 1/m²). But that's about the wavelengths of emitted photons, not the wavelength associated with a particle's momentum. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly? If it's asking about energy levels or something else, but the question clearly states linear momentum and wavelength of a free particle, so Rydberg doesn't seem right. 

Wait, could it be that in some contexts, people use the Rydberg constant in relation to de Broglie wavelength? Let me check a reference. Wait, no, Rydberg is about spectral lines. Planck's is about quantization of energy. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a different theory, but I don't recall any connection between Rydberg and de Broglie's relation. 

Maybe the user is mistaken? Or perhaps there was a confusion between constants? Let me check the options again. The options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light. 

Hmm, unless there's a different version of the equation? Maybe using the reduced Planck constant ħ = h/(2π)? But even then, that's still Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, if the question is about the proportionality constant in the equation, so the actual constant is h, which is Planck's. So answer A is correct. So why does the user say the answer is C? 

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question where they are considering the Rydberg constant as part of another formula? For example, in some textbooks, maybe they relate momentum to wavelength via Rydberg? 

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation when considering relativistic momentum? No, even then, the de Broglie wavelength would still involve h. 

Wait, let me think again. The question is from a multiple-choice, so maybe it's a common mistake. For some reason, if someone confuses the constants involved in different phenomena, they might think Rydberg is the answer. But according to standard physics, de Broglie wavelength is h over p, so Planck's constant. 

Hmm, unless... is there a scenario where someone might think of the Rydberg constant? For example, in the context of the Bohr model? The Rydberg constant is related to the Bohr radius and energy levels. But Bohr model's angular momentum quantization uses nħ, so again Planck's constant. 

Alternatively, maybe in some older textbooks or translations, there was an error? 

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong? Because as per my knowledge, the correct answer should be A. 

Wait, the user is asking why the correct answer is C, so perhaps the actual question had different options, or there was a misunderstanding. Maybe the question was about something else, like the Rydberg formula, but misworded. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in a different context where Rydberg is involved? Maybe in some specific scenario with particles in a box or something else... 

Wait, in the formula for the de Broglie wavelength, the constant is directly Planck's. So unless the question is a trick, I can't see how Rydberg would be the correct answer here. 

Therefore, I think there might be an error in the question's options or the supposed correct answer. The user might have a typo or misremembered the question. Alternatively, maybe the original question was different. But based on standard physics, the answer should be A. Planck's constant. 

Perhaps the user is confused because they saw the Rydberg constant in another context related to wavelengths, like in atomic physics, but that's separate from the de Broglie wavelength. 

So, in conclusion, unless there's some specific context I'm missing, the correct answer should be A. The user's assertion that it's C seems incorrect. Maybe they can double-check the question or the source? 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}

Wait, but the user specified that the correct answer is C. However, based on standard physics, the correct answer is A. There's a contradiction here. Since the user is asking why it's C, I need to address that. Maybe they have a different perspective.

Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscommunication. Let me check the original question again. The question is: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light.

If the user insists that the correct answer is C, but according to standard physics, that's incorrect. Perhaps the question is wrong, or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like using Rydberg's constant for a different relation?

Wait, actually, de Broglie's relation is wavelength = h / p. Planck's constant is the key here. The Rydberg constant is used in atomic physics for spectral lines, which is an entirely different context. Therefore, the correct answer must be A. 

Unless there's an error in the question, but according to the user, the correct answer is C. Since the user is asking for an explanation why it's C, I need to explain that it's incorrect unless there's a specific reason. 

Alternatively, maybe the question was about energy levels where Rydberg is involved, but that's not the case here. 

Since the user is confused, the best approach is to explain that according to standard physics, the answer should be Planck's constant (A), and that the Rydberg constant is unrelated. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question's answer key. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A, but the user's provided answer is C, so I need to clarify that discrepancy.
</think>

The question asks about the constant relating the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle as hypothesized by de Broglie. The key equation associated with de Broglie's hypothesis is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength, \(h\) is Planck's constant, and \(p\) is the linear momentum of the particle. This equation directly shows that Planck's constant (\(h\)) is the constant linking momentum and wavelength. 

The Rydberg constant (\(R\)) is not involved in this relationship. The Rydberg constant is used in the Rydberg formula for atomic spectra, which relates to the wavelengths of emitted photons in hydrogen-like atoms, not to the de Broglie wavelength of a particle. Boltzmann's constant (\(k_B\)) is related to thermal energy and the speed of light (\(c\)) is a fundamental constant in relativity and electromagnetism, neither of which are relevant to the de Broglie relation.

Given the standard physics understanding, the correct answer should be **A. Planck’s constant**. The assertion that the correct answer is **C. The Rydberg constant** is incorrect. It is likely a mistake in either the question or the provided answer key.
