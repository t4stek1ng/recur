There is a multiple-choice question: A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is D. deflected in the -y-direction?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a proton moving through electric and magnetic fields, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is D, which is deflected in the -y-direction when the potential difference is doubled. Let me start by recalling what I know about charged particles in electric and magnetic fields.

First, the proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. That means it gains kinetic energy from the electric potential. The formula for the kinetic energy gained by a charge q moving through a potential difference V is KE = qV. Since a proton has a charge of +e, its kinetic energy will be eV. 

Once it's moving, it enters a region where there's both an electric field E in the +x-direction and a magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The problem states that initially, when the proton is moving through this region with the original potential difference V, its trajectory isn't affected. That must mean that the net force on the proton in that region is zero. So the electric force and the magnetic force must be canceling each other out.

Let me write that down. The electric force on the proton is F_electric = q * E. Since the electric field is in the +x-direction, the force is also in the +x-direction because the proton is positively charged. 

The magnetic force is given by the Lorentz force equation: F_magnetic = q(v × B). The proton is moving in the +z-direction, and the magnetic field is in the +y-direction. Let me figure out the direction of the cross product v × B here. 

Using the right-hand rule: if velocity is along +z and magnetic field is along +y, then the cross product v × B would be in the direction perpendicular to both. Let me think: z cross y. The cross product of unit vectors: i x j = k, j x k = i, k x i = j. Wait, actually, let me recall the right-hand rule properly. 

The velocity v is in the +z direction (let's denote that as the k direction), and B is in the +y direction (j). So the cross product v × B is k × j. 

Wait, cross product is anti-commutative, so k × j = - (j × k). Let me remember that i × j = k, j × k = i, and k × i = j. Hmm, so if it's k × j, then that would be -i. Because j × k is i, so k × j is negative of that, so -i. 

Therefore, the magnetic force F_magnetic = q*(v × B) would be in the -i direction, which is the -x direction. Wait, but the electric force is in +x direction. So for the trajectory to be unaffected, these two forces must balance each other. So that means F_electric = F_magnetic in magnitude, so qE = qvB. Therefore, v must equal E/B. 

So the velocity of the proton when it enters the E and B fields must be v = E/B. Since it was accelerated from rest through potential difference V, we can relate that velocity to the potential. 

The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = eV. Therefore, v = sqrt(2eV/m). 

But we also have that v must equal E/B for the forces to cancel. Therefore, setting the two expressions for velocity equal:

sqrt(2eV/m) = E/B 

So that's the condition when there's no deflection. 

Now, the question says if we repeat the experiment with a potential difference of 2V, what happens? 

So now the kinetic energy will be (1/2)mv² = e*(2V). Therefore, the new velocity v' will be sqrt(2e*(2V)/m) = sqrt(4eV/m) = 2*sqrt(eV/m). 

Okay we also have that v must equal E/B for the forces to cancel. Therefore, setting the two expressions for velocity equal:

sqrt(2eV/m) = E/B 

So that's the condition when there's no deflection. 

Thus, the question says if we repeat the experiment with a potential difference of 2V, what happens? 

So now the kinetic energy will be (1/2)mv² = e*(2V). Therefore, the new velocity v' will be sqrt(2e*(2V)/m) = sqrt(4eV/m) = 2*sqrt(eV/m). 

Meanwhile we also have that v must equal E/B for the forces to cancel. Therefore, setting the two expressions for velocity equal:

sqrt(2eV/m) = E/B 

So that's the condition when there's no deflection. 

Ah, the question says if we repeat the experiment with a potential difference of 2V, what happens? 

So now the kinetic energy will be (1/2)mv² = e*(2V). Therefore, the new velocity v' will be sqrt(2e*(2V)/m) = sqrt(4eV/m) = 2*sqrt(eV/m).
