The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour? Why the correct answer is 13?<|im_end|>

Okay, let's see. The firefighters are trying to raise $6300, and after the first 3 hours, they've already got $2100. They need to figure out how many more hours they have to work to reach their goal, right? The question says to assume they raise the same amount every hour. Hmm, so first, maybe I should figure out how much they make per hour?

Alright, they made $2100 in 3 hours. To find the hourly rate, I can divide the total amount by the number of hours. Let me do that: $2100 divided by 3. Let me see, 2100 divided by 3 is... 700? Yeah, because 3 times 700 is 2100. So they're raising $700 each hour.

Now, their goal is $6300. They've already made $2100, so I need to figure out how much more they need. That would be $6300 minus $2100. Let me subtract that: 6300 minus 2100 is... 4200. So they still need $4200.

Since they make $700 every hour, how many more hours do they need to work to get $4200? I think I need to divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate. So, 4200 divided by 700. Let me calculate that. 700 times 6 is 4200, right? So 4200 divided by 700 is 6. That means they need to work 6 more hours?

Wait, but the question is asking for the total hours, not just the additional hours. Oh, right! They already worked 3 hours, so I need to add those 3 hours to the 6 more hours. 3 plus 6 is 9. Hmm, but the correct answer is supposed to be 13. Wait a second, did I do something wrong here?

Let me check again. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again: "For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?" So total hours. So initial 3 hours plus additional hours needed. Hmm, so according to my calculation, it's 9. But the correct answer is 13? That's conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake in the hourly rate?

Wait, let's see. If they need to reach $6300, and after 3 hours they have $2100, maybe the question is expecting that the rate changes? But the problem says to assume an equal amount raised in every hour. So the rate is constant. Hmm. Let me recalculate.

First, total needed: $6300. After 3 hours, they have $2100. So total remaining is 6300 - 2100 = 4200. If each hour they make 700, then 4200 / 700 = 6 hours more. Total hours would be 3 + 6 = 9. But why 13?

Thus, let's see. If they need to reach $6300, and after 3 hours they have $2100, maybe the question is expecting that the rate changes? But the problem says to assume an equal amount raised in every hour. So the rate is constant. Hmm. Let me denote T as the total hours.

First, total needed: $6300. After 3 hours, they have $2100. So total remaining is 6300 - 2100 = 4200. If each hour they make 700, then 4200 / 700 = 6 hours more. Total hours would be 3 + 6 = 9. But why 13?

Alright, let's see. If they need to reach $6300, and after 3 hours they have $2100, maybe the question is expecting that the rate changes? But the problem says to assume an equal amount raised in every hour. So the rate is constant. Hmm. Let me think of it this way.

First, total needed: $6300. After 3 hours, they have $2100. So total remaining is 6300 - 2100 = 4200. If each hour they make 700, then 4200 / 700 = 6 hours more. Total hours would be 3 + 6 = 9. But why 13?
