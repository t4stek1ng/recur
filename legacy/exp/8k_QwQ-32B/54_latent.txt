There is a multiple-choice question: Under ideal conditions, the electric and magnetic fields inside a superconductor are zero. Maxwell’s equations imply that which of the following must be true just outside the surface of the superconductor?. The options are: A. B = 0, B. B is perpendicular to the surface., C. B is tangential to the surface., D. B is time independent.. Why the correct answer is D. B is time independent.?<|im_end|>

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer to this question about superconductors and Maxwell's equations is option D: B is time independent. Let me start by recalling what I know about superconductors and Maxwell's equations.

First, the question says that under ideal conditions, the electric and magnetic fields inside a superconductor are zero. I remember that in a perfect conductor, like a superconductor, the electric field is zero because any electric field would cause the charges to move and cancel it out immediately. Since superconductors have no resistance, the currents can flow without dissipation. Now, the magnetic field inside is also zero due to the Meissner effect, right? That's when a superconductor expels the magnetic field from its interior when it transitions into the superconducting state. So inside the superconductor, both E and B are zero.

The question is asking about the conditions just outside the surface of the superconductor. The options are about the magnetic field B. The answer is supposed to be D, which says B is time independent. Hmm, I need to see why that must be true based on Maxwell's equations.

Let me think about Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions. For a conductor, especially a perfect one, I recall that the electric field just inside the conductor must be zero. The boundary conditions for electric and magnetic fields at a surface can be derived from Maxwell's equations. For instance, the displacement current or something related to the time derivative of the electric field might come into play here.

Wait, let me recall the boundary conditions. For the electric field, the tangential component is continuous across a boundary unless there's a surface current. The normal component has a discontinuity related to the surface charge, but in a superconductor, there's no net charge (since charges can move freely), so maybe the normal component is continuous? Wait, actually, for a perfect conductor, the electric field inside is zero, so the tangential component must be zero just outside the surface. Therefore, the electric field outside must be perpendicular to the surface? Hmm, but the question is about the magnetic field.

Magnetic fields have different boundary conditions. The tangential component of the magnetic field is continuous across a surface when there's no current. Wait, but in this case, since the superconductor can have persistent currents (since it's a superconductor), maybe there can be surface currents. The boundary condition for the magnetic field's normal component involves the surface current density. Let me get that straight.

The boundary condition for the magnetic field H (since B is μH) is that the tangential component of H is continuous across a surface unless there's a surface current. The normal component of B is continuous because there are no magnetic monopoles, but the tangential H has a jump proportional to the surface current density J_s.

But how does this relate to the problem? The question is about what must be true just outside the superconductor's surface given that inside E and B are zero. Let me think of the differential form of Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations in differential form involve the divergence and curl of E and B. Let's consider the curl of E first. The equation is:

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

In the superconductor, inside, E is zero, so ∇ × E = 0. Therefore, -∂B/∂t must also be zero. Wait, but inside the superconductor, B is zero, so ∂B/∂t would also be zero. Hmm, but maybe the key is to look at the boundary?

Alternatively, perhaps we should look at Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which is:

∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t

Since D = εE, and inside the superconductor, E is zero, so D is also zero. Also, inside the superconductor, there is no current density J because the superconducting current is on the surface? Or is there? Wait, actually, in a superconductor, the current is expelled to the surface, so the interior has no current. Therefore, inside the superconductor, J is zero. So in the interior, ∇ × H = 0 + ∂D/∂t. But since D is zero, ∂D/∂t would also be zero. So ∇ × H = 0 inside the superconductor, implying that H is irrotational there. But H is related to B via B = μH, so that would mean H is also curl-free. But since B is zero inside, this might not give us much.

Alternatively, let's consider the boundary conditions. Let's think about the tangential components. At the surface of the superconductor, the tangential component of E must be continuous. But inside, E is zero, so the tangential component of E outside must also be zero. Therefore, the electric field just outside the superconductor must be perpendicular to the surface. Similarly, the magnetic field's tangential component is related to the current.

Actually how does this relate to the problem? The question is about what must be true just outside the superconductor's surface given that inside E and B are zero. Let me think about the boundary conditions for electric and magnetic fields of the differential form of Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations in differential form involve the divergence and curl of E and B. Let's consider the curl of E first. The equation is:

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

In the superconductor, inside, E is zero, so ∇ × E = 0. Therefore, -∂B/∂t must also be zero. Wait, but inside the superconductor, B is zero, so ∂B/∂t would also be zero. Hmm, but maybe the key is to look at the boundary?

Earlier, perhaps we should look at Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which is:

∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t

Since D = εE, and inside the superconductor, E is zero, so D is also zero. Also, inside the superconductor, there is no current density J because the superconducting current is on the surface? Or is there? Wait, actually, in a superconductor, the current is expelled to the surface, so the interior has no current. Therefore, inside the superconductor, J is zero. So in the interior, ∇ × H = 0 + ∂D/∂t. But since D is zero, ∂D/∂t would also be zero. So ∇ × H = 0 inside the superconductor, implying that H is irrotational there. But H is related to B via B = μH, so that would mean H is also curl-free. But since B is zero inside, this might not give us much.

Suppose, let's consider the boundary conditions. Let's think about the tangential components. At the surface of the superconductor, the tangential component of E must be continuous. But inside, E is zero, so the tangential component of E outside must also be zero. Therefore, the electric field just outside the superconductor must be perpendicular to the surface. Similarly, the magnetic field's tangential component is related to the current.

Actually how does this relate to the problem? The question is about what must be true just outside the superconductor's surface given that inside E and B are zero. Let me get back to the question of the differential form of Maxwell's equations.

Hmm, let's consider the boundary conditions. Let's think about the tangential components. At the surface of the superconductor, the tangential component of E must be continuous.
