Okay, let's see. Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu, and he needs to figure out how much butter he'll require. The problem says it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make one dozen croissants. He plans to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week. The question is asking how many pounds of butter he'll need in total. The answer given is 14, but I need to verify that step by step. 

First, let me break down the information. 

So, per dozen croissants, the butter needed is 1/4 pound. He's making 4 dozen each day. So, first, maybe I should find out how much butter he uses in a day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Starting with daily usage: If 1 dozen requires 1/4 pound, then 4 dozen would need 4 times that amount. Let me write that out.

Butter per day = (Number of dozens per day) × (Butter per dozen)
Butter per day = 4 × (1/4) pounds

Hmm, 4 times 1/4 is... 4 divided by 4 is 1. So that's 1 pound per day? That seems right. Wait, so each day he uses 1 pound of butter for 4 dozen croissants. 

Then, since he's doing this for a week, which is 7 days, the total butter needed would be 1 pound/day multiplied by 7 days. 

Total butter = 1 × 7 = 7 pounds. 

Now, 4 times 1/4 is... 4 divided by 4 is 1. So that's 1 pound per day? That seems right. Wait, so each day he uses 1 pound of butter for 4 dozen croissants. 

Now, since he's doing this for a week, which is 7 days, the total butter needed would be 1 pound/day multiplied by 7 days. 

Total butter = 1 × 7 = 7 pounds. 

However, 4 times 1/4 is... 4 divided by 4 is 1. So that's 1 pound per day? That seems right. Wait, so each day he uses 1 pound of butter for 4 dozen croissants. 

Next, since he's doing this for a week, which is 7 days, the total butter needed would be 1 pound/day multiplied by 7 days. 

Total butter = 1 × 7 = 7 pounds.
