Identify the number of 13C-NMR signals produced by the final product, denoted as E, resulting from the series of reactions shown below.
Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 ---> A
A + BuLi ---> B
B + Bromoethane ---> C
C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ ---> D
D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi ---> E
Why the correct answer is: 6?
