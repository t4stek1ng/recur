There is a multiple-choice question: A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is: D. deflected in the -y-direction?
