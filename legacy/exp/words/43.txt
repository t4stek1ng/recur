There is a multiple-choice question: A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is. The options are: A. 0.04 V, B. 0.1 V, C. 2.5 V, D. 10 V. Why the correct answer is: A. 0.04 V?
