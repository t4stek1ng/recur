There is a multiple-choice question: Languages with a structure that implements abstract data types (e.g., a C++ class) can prevent access to components of this structure by all operations except those that are part of this structure. However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?
I. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.
II. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.
III. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.. The options are: A. I only, B. III only, C. I and II only, D. II and III only. Why the correct answer is: A. I only?
