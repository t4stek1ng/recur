There is a multiple-choice question: The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because. The options are: A. electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do, B. the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium, C. the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas, D. electrons in metals are highly relativistic. Why the correct answer is: B. the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium?
