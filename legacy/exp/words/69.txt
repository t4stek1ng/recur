There is a multiple-choice question: A researcher tests for structural stability in the following regression model:

$y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_{2t} + \beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t$

The total sample of 200 observations is split exactly in half for the sub-sample regressions. Which would be the unrestricted residual sum of squares?. The options are: A. The RSS for the whole sample, B. The RSS for the first sub-sample, C. The RSS for the second sub-sample, D. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples. Why the correct answer is: B. The RSS for the first sub-sample?
