Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

"Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. What is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2? Why the correct answer is: doublet of doublets."

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. I need to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each with two carbons. So, it's a norbornane-like structure, but with bridges of two carbons each. The ketone is at position 2, so the carbonyl group is attached to one of the bridgeheads.

Irradiating this with UV light usually leads to some kind of photochemical reaction. Since it's a bicyclic ketone, I think about the Norrish Type reactions. Norrish I is cleavage of the ketone to form two radicals, but Norrish II is hydrogen abstraction leading to cyclization. However, in bicyclic systems, irradiation can lead to ring opening via retro-Diels-Alder or some other process.

Wait, another possibility: it might undergo a ring-opening via the Norrish Type I reaction. Let's think about that. If the ketone is bridgehead, then breaking it would lead to a larger ring or a less strained structure.

Alternatively, could it be a (2+2) photocycloaddition? But that usually forms a four-membered ring, which might not fit here.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is similar to adamantane structure but with a ketone. Maybe upon irradiation, the ketone undergoes some cleavage. Since the molecular weight remains the same, it's not a ring-opening that loses CO or anything. So maybe it's a rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: in bicyclic ketones, the γ- or δ-lactones can form upon irradiation, but that would involve oxygen. Alternatively, it could undergo a [1,3] shift or some hydride shift. Or maybe a retro-Diels-Alder?

Wait, let me think about the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has a bridgehead ketone. Upon irradiation, the bridgehead ketone could undergo a Norrish Type II cleavage, leading to a diradical, which could then abstract a hydrogen or form a new bond.

Wait, Norrish II leads to a conjugated diene and a carbonyl compound. But if the molecule is symmetric, maybe it forms a bridged diene? Wait, but the molecular weight is the same, so that suggests it's just a rearrangement without loss or gain of atoms.

Hmm, so perhaps it's a [1,2]-shift. Wait, but without more info, maybe it's easier to think about the possible products. Since the molecular weight is the same, the product is an isomer.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one upon UV irradiation could undergo a ring-opening to form a less strained structure. Alternatively, maybe it undergoes a [2.2.2] to a less bridged system.

Wait, another angle: when bicyclic ketones like bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one are irradiated, they can undergo γ-ring opening but that might not fit here. Alternatively, they can undergo a photochemical [1,2] shift of the carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a retro-Diels-Alder. The bridgehead ketone could be part of a six-membered ring that could break down into a diene and a carbonyl. But wait, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2], which is a smaller system. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the ketone could undergo a [1,1] shift, but that's not common. Wait, perhaps it's a ring opening to form an alkene. But then the product would have a double bond, but molecular weight would stay the same because it's just a rearrangement.

Wait, let me try to think about the Norrish Type I. That would cleave the ketone into two fragments. So, if we have bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, breaking the ketone would result in two parts. But considering the structure, perhaps it's breaking into a smaller ring and something else. However, since the molecular weight is the same, it's not a cleavage but a rearrangement.

Wait, maybe it's a bridgehead carbonyl that shifts to another position. For example, moving from position 2 to another bridgehead. But there are only three bridgeheads in bicyclo[2.2.2], so maybe the ketone shifts to another bridgehead, creating a different bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, the ketone could become a bridge, leading to a different bicyclic system. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to look up what happens when bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated. From my memory, bicyclic ketones under UV can undergo ring opening via Norrish Type reactions. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, they can undergo a [2+2] photocycloaddition, but that would form a smaller ring.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a bridgehead is present, the molecule can undergo a ring-opening to form an alkene. For example, the ketone could be involved in a conjugated diene after ring opening. So, product 1 might have a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group in a different position.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, but that might not fit the molecular weight.

Wait, perhaps it's a retro-Diels-Alder where part of the ring is broken down into a diene and a carbonyl. But then, the product would have a smaller ring, so molecular weight might decrease if it's a cleavage. But here, the molecular weight remains the same, so it's an isomerization.

Wait, maybe the ketone is shifting position. From position 2 to another bridgehead, say to position 1. But wait, position 1 is another bridgehead, so maybe it becomes bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-one. But then, that would just be a positional isomer, but is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-expansion or ring-contraction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ketone undergoes a (2,2) sigmatropic shift. Wait, is that possible? Or a (3,3) shift? Wait, that's more common in steroids and terpenes.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [1,2] hydride shift. But then the ketone would shift to a different position, but again, would that change the structure enough?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual mechanism. When a ketone is at a bridgehead, like in norbornane, irradiation can cause cleavage of the C-O bond, leading to a diradical. Then, depending on where the diradical forms, it could rearrange.

Wait, if the diradical forms at the bridgehead, it might abstract a hydrogen from another bridge, leading to ring opening.

Wait, in the case of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, upon cleavage, the bridge might break, leading to a different structure.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is like a triangle with three bridges, each of two carbons. The ketone is on one of the bridgeheads.

If the C=O bond breaks, it would form a diradical on the bridgehead. Then, perhaps a hydrogen from another bridge is abstracted, leading to ring opening. Alternatively, the diradical could lead to a [2+2] cycloreversion, but that would form a four-membered ring, which might not fit.

Wait, but if the C=O bond breaks, we get a diradical on the bridgehead. Then, maybe the molecule opens up into a long chain with a double bond.

Wait, but that would change the molecular weight, but here it's the same. So maybe it's just a structural rearrangement.

Alternatively, it's a retro-Diels-Alder where part of the molecule becomes a diene and the ketone becomes something else.

Wait, but again, molecular weight remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the ketone isomerizes to an enol form. Enols can sometimes form under certain conditions, but I don't know if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes a conjugation with a bridge, forming a conjugated diene, but that would change the structure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the product after hydrogenation. After irradiation, product 1 is treated with hydrogen and palladium on carbon, giving product 2.

Product 1 must have a double bond because hydrogenation would add H2 across it. So, if product 1 is an alkene, then product 2 would be the corresponding alkane.

But wait, starting from bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a bridged ketone, irradiation with UV would likely form an alkene via a Norrish Type I or II reaction.

Wait, Norrish Type I would cleave the ketone into two fragments, but since the molecular weight remains the same, that's not cleavage but a rearrangement.

Wait, but maybe it's a [2+2] photocycloaddition, but that would form a four-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the product after UV irradiation.

Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one upon UV irradiation might undergo a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene. So, product 1 is a diene.

Wait, but if that's the case, then when product 1 is hydrogenated, product 2 would be a fully saturated structure.

Wait, but that doesn't directly help me with the NMR splitting pattern. Let me think about what product 2 is.

Wait, if product 1 is a conjugated diene, then hydrogenation would give a single bond. So product 2 would have a single bond where the double bond was.

But I need to know the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of product 1 and product 2.

So, starting with bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a bridged bicyclic ketone. Upon irradiation, it forms product 1, which has the same molecular weight. So it's an isomer.

If it's a Norrish Type II, it would form a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. But since the molecular weight is the same, the diene must be part of a ring system.

Wait, perhaps it forms a bridged diene structure. So, maybe the bridgehead ketone becomes a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, but that's not possible because the bridgehead can't have a double bond unless it's bridgehead double bond, which is strained.

Wait, perhaps the product is bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene, but that would be a bridgehead double bond, which is not favorable.

Alternatively, maybe it's a less bridged system, like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something, but that's a different ring system.

Wait, perhaps I need to look up the known reaction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one under UV light.

After a quick recall, I remember that bicyclic ketones can undergo ring-opening upon irradiation to form alkenes. For example, in some cases, the bridge might break, and the ketone becomes an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the keto group is involved in a [2+2] photocycloaddition, forming a bridged cyclobutane, but that would change the molecular weight.

Wait, maybe it's a ring expansion. If the bridge breaks, and the molecule becomes a larger ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the bridge opens to form a larger ring with a conjugated diene.

But honestly, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that product 1 is a diene, which when hydrogenated, gives a saturated compound.

So, if product 1 is a diene, then product 2 would have a single bond where the double bond was. But let me think about the structure.

Wait, suppose product 1 is bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-5-one or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening to form a less bridged structure with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the bridge is broken, and the molecule becomes a monocyclic compound with a double bond, like cyclooctene or something else.

Wait, but if that happens, the molecular formula would remain the same since it's just a ring-opening. So, product 1 would be, say, cyclooctenone.

Wait, but cyclooctenone has a double bond and a ketone. Then, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, giving cyclooctanone.

Wait, but the starting material was bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is different from cyclooctanone. So, is that the case?

Wait, if product 1 is cyclooctenone, then product 2 would be cyclooctanone. So, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which has a bridge, while product 2 is cyclooctanone, which is a monocyclic ketone.

Is that plausible? So, upon irradiation, the bridge breaks, and the molecule becomes a monocyclic diene ketone, which then is hydrogenated to a monocyclic ketone.

If that's the case, then product 2 is cyclooctanone.

Now, what is the structure of cyclooctanone? It's an eight-membered ring with a ketone group. So, the ring is chair-like, but in reality, cyclooctanone can have some puckering.

In the NMR spectrum of cyclooctanone, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one near the carbonyl group because of the electron-withdrawing effect. So, the alpha hydrogens adjacent to the ketone would be deshielded.

Wait, in cyclooctanone, the alpha hydrogens are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. How many neighboring hydrogens do they have?

In the chair-like structure, each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two other hydrogens on the same carbon and possibly others on neighboring carbons.

Wait, but cyclooctanone is a non-chair structure. It's more like a boat or a twist. So, the alpha hydrogens are each adjacent to two other hydrogens on their own carbon, but also to the neighboring carbons.

Wait, let me think. Each carbon in the eight-membered ring is connected to two other carbons. The alpha carbon is adjacent to the carbonyl, so it's connected to the carbonyl carbon and two other ring carbons.

Each alpha hydrogen is on the carbon next to the carbonyl, so the structure is:

O
|
C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, that's not correct because cyclooctanone is a ring. So, it's an eight-membered ring with one ketone.

So, in the ring, each carbon is connected to two others, and one of them is the carbonyl carbon. So, the carbonyl is at one position, say carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 is adjacent to carbon 1 and carbon 8. Similarly, all other carbons are connected in a ring.

So, the alpha carbons are carbons 2 and 8, each attached to the carbonyl carbon at carbon 1.

Each alpha carbon (2 and 8) has two hydrogens attached. So, each alpha hydrogen is on carbon 2 or 8.

Now, each alpha hydrogen (on carbon 2 and 8) is adjacent to how many other hydrogens?

Looking at the structure, each alpha hydrogen is on a CH2 group. So, each of these CH2 groups has two hydrogens.

Wait, but in the ring, each alpha hydrogen is also adjacent to the neighboring carbons. So, for carbon 2, it's connected to carbon 1 (the carbonyl) and carbon 3. So, hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent to the hydrogens on carbon 1 (alpha hydrogens) and carbon 3.

Wait, but carbon 1 is the carbonyl, which is a double bond O, so carbon 1 has no hydrogens. Therefore, the alpha hydrogen on carbon 2 is only adjacent to the two hydrogens on carbon 3.

Similarly, the alpha hydrogen on carbon 8 is adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 7.

Wait, so each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on the neighboring carbon.

But that would mean each alpha hydrogen is a triplet, right? Because each is adjacent to two hydrogens.

But wait, let me think about the actual structure. If the ring is chair-like, the alpha hydrogens would be in a certain position.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of J coupling. Each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on the next carbon, but also, in a ring structure, they can be coupled to hydrogens on the previous carbon as well.

Wait, no, in a ring, each hydrogen is adjacent only to the next and previous carbon's hydrogens in the sequence.

Wait, actually, in a ring, each hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent (J coupling) to the hydrogens on carbon 3 (on the same side) and carbon 1. But carbon 1 is the carbonyl, which doesn't have hydrogens. So, carbon 2's hydrogens are only adjacent to carbon 3's hydrogens.

Wait, but that would mean each alpha hydrogen is adjacent only to two hydrogens on carbon 3. Therefore, each alpha hydrogen is a triplet because there are two neighboring hydrogens.

But wait, the question says the most deshielded hydrogen is a doublet of doublets. So, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is not the alpha hydrogen but another one.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is a bridgehead hydrogen if product 2 is a bridged structure. But if product 2 is cyclooctanone, then it's a monocyclic structure without bridges.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me go back.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bridged diene, so when hydrogenated, product 2 has two double bonds or some branching.

Wait, another approach: If product 1 is a diene, then product 2 would have a single bond where the double bond was.

But if product 1 is a bridged diene, then product 2 would have a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the actual splitting. The question says the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2 has a splitting pattern of a doublet of doublets.

So, what causes a doublet of doublets? Each hydrogen is split by two different neighboring hydrogens, each with a different J value.

So, the hydrogen nucleus is next to two different sets of hydrogens, each causing a split.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, each with a different coupling constant.

In a ring structure, each hydrogen can be coupled to its immediate neighbors.

So, in a six-membered ring, each hydrogen is coupled to two adjacent hydrogens, which are equivalent, so it's a triplet. But in an eight-membered ring, maybe the couplings are different.

Wait, in an eight-membered ring like cyclooctane, each hydrogen is adjacent to two others on each side, but depending on the substituents, the couplings can vary.

Wait, in our case, product 2 is a monocyclic ketone, cyclooctanone.

So, the alpha hydrogens (on carbons 2 and 8) are each next to carbonyl, and each has two hydrogens on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Carbon 1 is the carbonyl, carbons 2 and 8 are adjacent to it, each with two hydrogens.

Each alpha hydrogen (on carbon 2) is adjacent to the two hydrogens on carbon 3. So, each alpha hydrogen would be split into a triplet by the two hydrogens on carbon 3.

But the question says it's a doublet of doublets, which implies two different coupling constants.

So, perhaps the alpha hydrogen is not only adjacent to the two hydrogens on carbon 3 but also to another set of hydrogens, like on carbon 1.

Wait, but carbon 1 is the carbonyl and doesn't have hydrogens. So, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the alpha hydrogen is also adjacent to another hydrogen on the same carbon, but that's not the case because each carbon has two hydrogens, and in a ring, they are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the alpha hydrogen is also coupled to the neighboring alpha hydrogen on the same side?

Wait, let me think about the actual structure.

In cyclooctanone, the alpha carbons are carbons 2 and 8, each with two hydrogens. These hydrogens are on the same side as the carbonyl group.

Wait, the two alpha hydrogens on carbon 2 are on the same side (cis) to the ketone. So, each of these hydrogens is adjacent to the two hydrogens on carbon 3, but also, in a chair conformation, maybe there's another coupling.

Wait, maybe they are also coupled to the hydrogens on carbon 1, but carbon 1 is the carbonyl, so no hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen on carbon 2 is coupled to the hydrogens on carbon 8 as well, but that's across the ring, so the coupling would be very small and might not be observed.

Wait, but in reality, in an eight-membered ring, each hydrogen is coupled to its immediate neighbors, but in chair conformations, some couplings can be larger.

Alternatively, maybe in the case of cyclooctanone, each alpha hydrogen is a triplet because of the two adjacent hydrogens on the next carbon. But the question says it's a doublet of doublets.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption that product 2 is cyclooctanone is wrong.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe product 1 is a norbornene-like structure, which upon hydrogenation becomes norbornane.

Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But our starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a different system.

Wait, if product 1 is a diene, maybe it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene, which upon hydrogenation gives bicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

But then, product 2 would be bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is just the saturated version of the starting material but without the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, so product 1 would be a diene, and product 2 would be the fully saturated bicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

But then, the question is about the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2.

So, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the bridgehead hydrogens are more deshielded because of the ring strain. Each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to three other carbons.

So, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead carbon (there are three bridgeheads) has a hydrogen. Each of these hydrogens is on a carbon connected to three others.

So, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to three other hydrogens: the two on the same carbon and one on each of the adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, no, each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other bridgehead carbons? No, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons, but all are bridgeheads.

Wait, no, let me clarify. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead carbon.

Wait, no, actually, each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads? No, that can't be. Wait, no, in bicyclo[m.n.p] systems, each bridgehead is connected to m, n, p other bridgeheads.

Wait, no, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, the bridgeheads are carbons 1, 3, and 5, for example.

Each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads and two non-bridgeheads. Wait, no, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the structure:

- Carbon 1 is connected to carbons 2, 3, and 5.
- Carbon 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 6.
- Carbon 3 is connected to 1, 2, and 4.
- Carbon 4 is connected to 3, 5, and 7.
- Carbon 5 is connected to 1, 4, and 8.
- Carbon 6 is connected to 2, 7, and 8.
- Carbon 7 is connected to 4, 6, and 8.
- Carbon 8 is connected to 5, 6, and 7.

Wait, that seems off. Actually, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead.

Wait, no, each bridgehead is connected to three carbons: two bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a norbornane-like structure with an additional bridge.

Alternatively, each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons: two bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead.

So, in that case, each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon that is connected to three other bridgeheads? No, that can't be because that would create a small ring.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead carbons in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane each have three substituents: two bridgeheads and one CH2 group.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

In product 2, which is the hydrogenated form of product 1, which is a diene. So, if product 1 was a diene, product 2 is fully saturated.

Assuming product 1 was a bridged diene, product 2 would have a bridge with single bonds.

So, let's say product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

In bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the bridgehead hydrogens are each on bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead carbon has three bonds: two to other bridgeheads and one to a CH2 group.

So, the bridgehead hydrogens are on carbons that are each connected to two bridgeheads and one CH2.

Wait, no, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads and one non-bridgehead carbon.

Wait, actually, the structure is three bridges, each of two carbons, forming a sort of triangular structure.

So, the bridgehead carbons each have three bonds: two to adjacent bridgeheads and one to a CH2 group.

Therefore, each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to two bridgehead carbons and one CH2.

So, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to the two bridgehead hydrogens on the same carbon and the bridgehead hydrogens on the adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, no, each bridgehead carbon has only one hydrogen, and it's on a bridgehead.

Wait, maybe I need to count the neighboring hydrogens.

In bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead carbon has three substituents: two bridgehead carbons and one CH2 group.

So, each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to two bridgeheads and one CH2.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to the hydrogens on the same carbon (which are two), and the hydrogens on the adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, but each bridgehead has only one hydrogen, so the bridgehead hydrogen is only adjacent to the two hydrogens on its own carbon and the hydrogens on the adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, how many neighboring hydrogens does the bridgehead hydrogen have?

On its own carbon, two hydrogens are attached, but they are equivalent. Also, each adjacent bridgehead has one hydrogen each, but they are across the bridge, so the coupling might be small.

Wait, but in reality, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead hydrogen is only adjacent to the two hydrogens on the same carbon. Because the bridgehead carbons are connected to each other via the bridges, the next bridgehead hydrogens are too far away to couple significantly.

Wait, no, that can't be. Each bridgehead carbon is connected to three others, so the bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to three other carbons.

Wait, the bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgehead carbons and one non-bridgehead carbon.

So, the bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to two other bridgeheads and one CH2.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent (three bonds away) to the hydrogens on the two bridgeheads and the CH2 group.

Wait, but in terms of NMR coupling, couplings are typically observed between adjacent carbons (J ~3-10 Hz). Hydrogens on adjacent carbons, especially if they are on bridgeheads, might not be coupled if they are across the bridge.

Wait, but in a bridge, the bridgehead hydrogens are across the bridge. So, the bridgehead hydrogen is three bonds away from the adjacent bridgehead hydrogens, but that's still too far for significant coupling (usually, couplings are up to four bonds, but they get weaker).

So, perhaps the bridgehead hydrogen is only coupled to the two hydrogens on the same carbon. Therefore, it would be a triplet.

But the question says it's a doublet of doublets, which implies two different coupling partners.

Wait, maybe the bridgehead hydrogen is also coupled to the hydrogens on the adjacent non-bridgehead carbons.

Wait, each bridgehead carbon is connected to a non-bridgehead carbon (like in norbornane). So, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to the non-bridgehead carbons.

So, for example, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to a CH2 group. So, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to the two hydrogens on the CH2 group.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen is coupled to two hydrogens on its own carbon and two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 are equivalent, so that would be a doublet of triplets or something.

Wait, let me think. Each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon (let's say carbon A) connected to two other bridgeheads (B and C) and one CH2 (D).

So, the bridgehead hydrogen on A is adjacent to the two hydrogens on D, since D is connected to A. So, each bridgehead hydrogen is next to two hydrogens on the CH2 group.

In addition, the bridgehead hydrogen is also adjacent to the two hydrogens on the same carbon A.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to four hydrogens: two on its own carbon and two on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in reality, on the same carbon, the two hydrogens are equivalent, and on the CH2 group, the two hydrogens are equivalent as well.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen would be split by the two hydrogens on its own carbon and the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2.

But in terms of splitting, each set of equivalent hydrogens causes a split. So, if a hydrogen is split by two different sets, each with a different coupling constant, it would be a doublet of doublets.

Therefore, the bridgehead hydrogen is a doublet of doublets because it's split by two different groups: the two hydrogens on its own carbon and the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead is connected to one CH2 group. So, the bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to the two hydrogens on the CH2 group. So, the coupling from the CH2 group would be one value, and the coupling from the same carbon's hydrogens would be another.

Wait, but the same carbon's two hydrogens are equivalent, so they would cause a triplet when split. If the bridgehead hydrogen is also split by the CH2 group's hydrogens, that would add another splitting, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

But the question says it's a doublet of doublets, so maybe the bridgehead hydrogen is split by two different sets of hydrogens, each with different coupling constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead hydrogen is only split by the adjacent CH2 group's hydrogens and not by the same carbon's hydrogens, because in the chair-like structure, the same carbon's hydrogens are on the same side, leading to coupling, but the CH2 group's hydrogens are on the opposite side.

Wait, maybe in the most stable conformation, the bridgehead hydrogen is gauche to the CH2 group's hydrogens, so they are not coupled. But that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to simplify.

In bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridgehead hydrogen is on a carbon connected to two other bridgeheads and one CH2 group.

The bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to:

- Two hydrogens on the same bridgehead carbon (equivalent, so they cause a triplet).

- Two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group (equivalent, so they would cause another splitting).

But in reality, if the bridgehead hydrogen is also adjacent to the CH2 group, which is two hydrogens, then each of those two hydrogens would split the bridgehead hydrogen into a doublet, and the two on the same carbon would split it into a triplet. But the order of splitting matters.

Wait, no, splitting is based on the number of neighboring hydrogens. If the bridgehead hydrogen has two equivalent hydrogens on its own carbon and two non-equivalent hydrogens on the CH2 group, it would be split by each set.

But in reality, the two hydrogens on the CH2 group are equivalent, so they would cause a single split, not a double split.

Alternatively, if the bridgehead hydrogen is split by two non-equivalent sets, it would be a doublet of doublets.

But in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the bridgehead hydrogen is split by the two equivalent hydrogens on its own carbon and the two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group. Therefore, it would be a triplet from the same carbon and a doublet from the CH2 group.

But because the same carbon's hydrogens cause a triplet, and the CH2 group's hydrogens cause a doublet, the overall splitting would be a triplet of doublets.

But the question says it's a doublet of doublets.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead hydrogen is only coupled to the adjacent CH2 group's hydrogens, and not to the same carbon's hydrogens. That would result in a doublet.

But that doesn't seem right because the same carbon's hydrogens are adjacent.

Wait, maybe in the bicyclo system, the bridgehead hydrogen is not adjacent to the same carbon's hydrogens because they are on the same face or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is not a bridgehead hydrogen but another one.

Wait, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the bridgehead hydrogens are more deshielded because of the ring strain, making them
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of product 1 is the same as the starting material. Then, product 1 is stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. The question is about the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 2, and it hints that the correct answer is a doublet of doublets. So, I need to figure out why that splitting occurs.

First, let me recall what bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one looks like. It's a norbornane system, which is a bicyclic compound with three bridges, each of two carbons, right? So, the structure is like three six-membered rings fused together in a sort of triangular arrangement. The ketone group is on carbon 2. So, in the molecule, the carbonyl is on one of the bridgehead carbons.

Now, the first reaction is irradiation with UV radiation. I remember that ketones can undergo photolysis, especially under UV light, which can lead to the cleavage of the ketone group. Specifically, Norrish Type I cleavage comes to mind. In this cleavage, the ketone group breaks, and the molecule typically forms a diradical intermediate. But since the molecular weight of product 1 is the same as the starting material, that suggests it's not a cleavage reaction that would break the molecule into smaller pieces. So maybe it's a ring-opening reaction?

Wait, another thought: sometimes, ketones can undergo [2+2] photocycloadditions, but that usually forms a four-membered ring, which would change the molecular weight. Since the molecular weight remains the same, that probably isn't it either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening via an electrocyclic reaction? For bicyclic ketones, UV irradiation can cause ring-opening. For example, in bicyclo systems, irradiation can lead to the breaking of a bridge, which could form a conjugated diene. But wait, would that change the molecular weight? No, because it's just a rearrangement.

Wait, no—ring-opening would not change the molecular formula, only the structure. So, if the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which has a molecular formula of C8H12O, the product after ring-opening would still have C8H12O, assuming the ring-opening doesn't lead to any loss or gain of atoms. So maybe product 1 is an open-chain ketone?

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bridgehead ketone. I think that upon UV irradiation, bridgehead ketones can undergo a Norrish Type I cleavage, but that would likely result in smaller fragments. However, if the irradiation doesn't lead to cleavage but instead to some rearrangement, perhaps a [1,3]-shift or a retro-Diels-Alder type reaction?

Wait, another thought: maybe the bridgehead carbonyl is involved in some way. I remember that in some bicyclic ketones, UV irradiation can lead to the formation of a conjugated dienone via a [4π] electrocyclic ring-opening. Let me try to visualize this. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has a bridgehead carbonyl. If that carbonyl is involved in a conjugated system, maybe the bridge can open up.

Wait, perhaps the ring opens to form a tricyclic structure? Or maybe a different bicyclic system. Alternatively, maybe the bridge breaks, and the ketone becomes part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, could it be a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement? The Cope or Claisen rearrangement? But for that, do we have the necessary structure? The starting material is a bridged bicyclic ketone. Maybe the ring opens to form a more extended system?

Wait, perhaps the ketone is involved in a retro-aldol reaction. No, that usually requires enolates, but under UV irradiation, maybe the bridge breaks. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a cleavage of a bridged ketone into an alkene. No, wait, that would change the molecular formula, but the problem states the molecular weight is the same, so no loss or gain.

Hmm, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges, each with two carbons. If the bridge with the carbonyl group is split, maybe it converts into a larger ring.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead breaks, and the molecule becomes a monocyclic compound. If the bridge breaks, perhaps the molecule becomes a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group attached? No, because the molecular weight is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge doesn't break but the carbonyl group becomes conjugated with the bridge. Wait, maybe the carbonyl group shifts position.

Wait, perhaps the most likely reaction is that the bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoes a [2+2] photocycloaddition. But if it's a bridgehead, that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone group undergoes a Norrish Type I cleavage, but since the molecular weight remains the same, perhaps it's a hydrogen transfer, not a cleavage. So, instead of breaking into two fragments, it abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a diradical which might rearrange.

Wait, Norrish Type I cleavage usually leads to the breaking of the alpha bond to the carbonyl, creating two radicals. If the product is a diradical, perhaps it can undergo some rearrangement. But then, what would product 1 be?

Alternatively, maybe the uv irradiation leads to a [1,3]-shift, moving the carbonyl group. So, for example, if the bridgehead ketone shifts from one bridgehead to another via a hydride or alkyl shift.

Wait, actually, I think I have heard of such a reaction before. For bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, UV irradiation can cause the ketone group to undergo a retro-aldol-like cleavage, but that would lead to smaller molecules. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is the same molecular formula but a different structure, such as a diene. Maybe the bridge breaks, and a new double bond forms, but without changing the molecular formula.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has a bridgehead carbonyl. If the bridge breaks adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe it results in a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. Let me see: the starting material is a bicyclo structure with three bridges. If one bridge breaks, perhaps it becomes a monocyclic structure with a double bond. So, product 1 could be bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-one or something similar.

Wait, let me count the carbons. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has 8 carbons. If one bridge breaks, maybe it becomes a seven-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but I also remember that bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one under UV light can undergo a ring-opening to form 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene or something similar, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the Norrish Type I cleavage. The Norrish Type I usually breaks the bond alpha to the carbonyl, leading to two fragments. But the problem says the molecular weight is the same, so that doesn't seem to fit. Unless it's a hydrogen transfer, leading to a diradical that doesn't cleave, but rearranges into something else.

Wait, perhaps the diradical formed can cyclize into a larger ring or a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule loses a hydrogen and forms a new double bond without breaking the ring.

Wait, maybe the most plausible reaction is that the bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon irradiation. The Diels-Alder reaction requires a diene and a dienophile. If the bicyclic compound can break into a diene and the ketone as a dienophile, that could happen. But then, again, the molecular weight would remain the same.

Wait, no, in a retro-Diels-Alder, the molecule would break into two parts: the diene and the dienophile. If product 1 is a combination of these, the molecular weight would decrease. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the starting material is too strained, and upon irradiation, the bridge breaks, leading to a more relaxed structure with a conjugated diene. So, product 1 might be 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, hold on, is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one a bridgehead ketone. Maybe upon irradiation, the bridgehead breaks, and the ketone is now part of a conjugated system. So, perhaps it becomes norbornene with a ketone, but that seems similar.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a [1,2]-shift of the carbonyl group, converting the bridgehead ketone into a non-bridgehead position, but keeping the same structure otherwise. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule undergoes a ring-opening to form a conjugated dienone, such as 2-cyclohexenone or something like that. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone, and 2-cyclohexenone would have a double bond adjacent to the ketone. If the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, ring-opening to form 2-cyclohexenone might not make sense in terms of the number of carbons.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoes a [4π] electrocyclic ring-opening to form a conjugated dienone. So, the bridge would open up, and the ketone would become conjugated with a double bond. So, product 1 would be something like 1,3-dienone. If that happens, the molecule would become less strained, which makes sense because the starting material is a highly strained bridgehead ketone.

So, if the bridge opens, we could get a molecule with a conjugated diene and a ketone group, perhaps something like 2,5-dien-2-one or similar. But I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is cycloocta-1,3,5-triene-2-one. That would have three double bonds, but wait, that seems too much.

Wait, actually, thinking about it, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one can be seen as norbornane with a bridgehead ketone. Upon irradiation, the bridge could break, and the ketone could shift. I think that in such a case, the molecule could undergo a retro-Diels-Alder or a different type of cleavage. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 1's structure differently. Since the molecular weight is the same, it's a structural isomer. So, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, and product 1 is a different bicyclic or monocyclic compound with the same molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead carbonyl group is involved in a [1,3]-hydride shift, moving from one bridgehead to another, but that wouldn't change the molecular formula. But I don't think that would create a new structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [1,2]-alkyl shift, moving a group from one bridge to another, but again, the molecular formula wouldn't change.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the second reaction. Product 1 is then stirred with palladium on carbon under hydrogen, forming product 2. So, palladium on carbon is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, if product 1 is a dienone (conjugated dienone), then hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bonds, turning the conjugated dienone into a saturated compound.

But wait, the starting material is a ketone, so after the first reaction, if it's a dienone, then product 1 is a conjugated dienone. Then, hydrogenation would hydrogenate the double bonds, adding hydrogen across them, turning the double bonds into single bonds.

So, product 2 would be a fully saturated compound, which is a cyclohexane derivative with the ketone group intact.

Wait, but let me think again. If product 1 is a dienone, then hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bonds, but since there are two double bonds, it would become a single bond, so product 2 might be a cyclohexane ring with the ketone group.

Wait, but no, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. If product 1 is a dienone, perhaps a monocyclic structure with two double bonds, and product 2 would be the fully hydrogenated version.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is cyclohexanone. But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone, which is different from the starting material's structure. But after ring-opening and hydrogenation, that could be the case.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what's happening step by step.

1. Start with bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one.

2. Irradiate with UV: forms product 1, same molecular weight, so same C8H12O.

3. Stir product 1 with Pd/C under H2: forms product 2, which is then analyzed for NMR.

So, step 2: UV irradiation of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one.

I think the most likely reaction here is a ring-opening via an electrocyclic process, forming a conjugated dienone. So, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a strained system, and upon irradiation, the bridge might open, releasing some strain and creating a conjugated diene.

Wait, I think I remember that in some bicyclic ketones, UV light can cause a ring-opening to form a conjugated dienone. For example, norbornene derivatives can open up upon irradiation.

So, if bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated, perhaps one of the bridges breaks, and the carbonyl group becomes conjugated with a double bond. So, product 1 would be a cyclooctatryl group with a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that product 1 is 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene-2-one. That would have three conjugated double bonds and a ketone, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, if the bridge breaks, maybe it forms a larger ring. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges, each with two carbons. If one bridge breaks, perhaps the molecule becomes a monocyclic compound with the ketone group attached.

Wait, maybe it becomes cyclohexenone. So, if the bridge breaks, the molecule becomes a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone group. That would be cyclohex-2-enone.

But wait, cyclohex-2-enone has a molecular formula of C8H10O. The starting material is C8H12O. So, if product 1 is cyclohex-2-enone, it would have a double bond, so two fewer hydrogens, but the problem says the molecular weight is the same. So, that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the double bonds are not formed, or maybe the molecule is still a bicyclic with a bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but again, that might produce smaller molecules.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the irradiation leads to a [1,2]-shift of the carbonyl group, moving it from one bridgehead to another, resulting in a different bicyclic structure, but with the same molecular formula. So, for example, if the carbonyl group shifts from bridgehead 2 to bridgehead 3 or something like that. But I'm not sure if that would change the structure enough to cause a splitting in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the irradiation causes the bridgehead ketone to undergo a ring-opening, forming a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group in a larger ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at what product 2 is. After hydrogenation, product 2 is the fully hydrogenated version of product 1. If product 1 is a dienone, then product 2 would be a fully saturated ring structure. If product 1 is a conjugated dienone, then product 2 would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group, perhaps.

Wait, but if product 1 is a dienone, then hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bonds. So, if product 1 is a conjugated dienone, product 2 would have a single bond in place of the double bonds, making a cyclohexane ring with a ketone.

But wait, starting from a bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, after irradiation, product 1 could be something like 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene-2-one. Then, hydrogenation would reduce all the double bonds, leading to 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene-2-one becoming 1,3,5-cyclooctanetriol, but that doesn't make sense because ketones don't get reduced to alcohols in this context.

Wait, no, hydrogenation would only add hydrogen across double bonds. So, if product 1 is a dienone, product 2 would have the double bonds hydrogenated. So, if product 1 is a dienone with two double bonds, product 2 would have two single bonds, making it a fully saturated ring.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridge opening into a larger ring with two double bonds, and product 2 would be a fully hydrogenated ring, perhaps a cyclohexane ring with the ketone.

Wait, but let me think about the splitting pattern in the NMR of product 2.

The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2's NMR, which is a doublet of doublets. So, the hydrogen in question is split by two different neighboring hydrogens, each causing a split, resulting in a doublet of doublets.

So, I need to figure out which hydrogen in product 2 is the most deshielded and has two neighboring hydrogens that cause splitting.

In a cyclohexane ring with a ketone, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to the carbonyl group, since the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group, making those hydrogens more deshielded. So, perhaps the alpha hydrogens (next to the carbonyl) would be deshielded.

In a cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens (on carbons 2 and 6, if the ketone is on carbon 1) would each be adjacent to the carbonyl. Each of these alpha hydrogens would have neighboring hydrogens on adjacent carbons. Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, each alpha hydrogen is on a carbon that is adjacent to two other carbons (next to the carbonyl). So, each alpha hydrogen would have two neighboring hydrogens: one on the same carbon (but in a chair conformation, maybe axial or equatorial) and one on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but in a chair conformation, alpha hydrogens might be axial or equatorial. If the hydrogen is axial, it might be deshielded and could have neighboring hydrogens on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. If product 2 is a fully hydrogenated compound with the ketone group intact, perhaps it's a cyclohexanone, and the most deshielded hydrogen is one of the alpha hydrogens.

But in cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens are each on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. Each alpha hydrogen would have two neighboring hydrogens: one on the same carbon and one on the adjacent carbon. Wait, no, on the same carbon, there would be two alpha hydrogens (if it's a chair, one axial and one equatorial). But in reality, each alpha carbon has two hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the NMR splitting. If a hydrogen is split by two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, it would result in a doublet of doublets.

So, for example, if a hydrogen has two neighboring hydrogens, each with a different chemical shift, causing two separate splits, the resulting peak would be a doublet of doublets.

Alternatively, if a hydrogen is adjacent to two different sets of non-equivalent hydrogens, each causing a split, it would result in a doublet of doublets.

So, in the case of the cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens would be adjacent to the ketone. Each alpha hydrogen is on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, so it's next to two other carbons. However, in a chair conformation, each alpha carbon (say C2 and C6 in cyclohexanone) has two hydrogens: one axial and one equatorial. But perhaps in this case, the chair isn't the main concern.

Wait, actually, in cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons (C2 and C6) each have two hydrogens. The alpha hydrogens on C2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl on C1 and to the hydrogens on C3. Similarly, on C6, adjacent to C5 and C1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure after both reactions.

So, product 1 is formed by UV irradiation of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. Then, product 1 is hydrogenated to form product 2.

If product 1 is a dienone, then product 2 would have the double bonds hydrogenated, so it would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone.

Wait, but if bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bridgehead ketone, and upon irradiation, it breaks one bridge, perhaps forming a conjugated dienone, such as 2,5-cyclooctadienone or similar.

Wait, perhaps the product of the first reaction is a dienone, which upon hydrogenation becomes a cyclohexane with a ketone.

But wait, product 1 is the dienone, so after hydrogenation, the double bonds become single bonds, so the ring would become saturated. So, product 2 would be a cyclohexanone.

Wait, but I thought the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a norbornane derivative. If it opens up to a cyclohexanone, that would make sense.

But wait, the molecular formula of cyclohexanone is C6H10O, but the starting material is C8H12O. So, that doesn't match. Wait, no, wait, starting from bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is C8H12O, if it opens up to a dienone, which would have two double bonds, but the molecular formula would still be C8H12O.

Wait, no, because when you open the bridge, you might lose some hydrogens. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, actually, the ring-opening would just reorganize the bonds without changing the number of hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the product is a larger ring with two double bonds, but the same molecular formula. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene-2-one. So, that's a ring with three conjugated double bonds and a ketone. Then, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across all the double bonds, turning them into single bonds, resulting in a fully saturated ring. So, product 2 would be 1,3,5-cyclooctanetriol? No, because hydrogenation of ketones doesn't usually lead to alcohols unless it's a reduction.

Wait, no, hydrogenation of a dienone would only hydrogenate the double bonds, not the ketone. So, product 2 would have the ketone group and all the double bonds hydrogenated.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think of product 1 as a conjugated dienone, say, cycloocta-1,3-dien-2-one. Then, product 2 would be cyclooctane-1,3-dione? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 2,5-cycloheptadienone or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a monocyclic compound with a single double bond, so after hydrogenation, it's a cyclohexane with a ketone. But then, the molecular formula would have two fewer hydrogens, but the problem says it's the same molecular weight, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the ring doesn't open all the way. Maybe the irradiation causes a [1,3]-shift in the carbonyl group, moving it to a different position, forming a different bridgehead structure. So, product 1 would still be a bicyclic compound but with a different substitution pattern.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I need to think about the splitting in NMR. The question is about a doublet of doublets, which implies that the most deshielded hydrogen has two neighboring hydrogens with different coupling constants. So, the splitting comes from two different sources.

So, perhaps in product 2, the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to two different sets of hydrogens, each causing a split. For example, in a cyclohexane ring with a ketone, the alpha hydrogens would each be next to two different environments.

Wait, in a chair conformation of cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens on C2 and C6 are each axial or equatorial. The axial hydrogens would be more deshielded due to the ring strain. Each axial hydrogen on C2 would be adjacent to the equatorial hydrogens on C1 (the ketone), but C1 doesn't have any hydrogens. Wait, no, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, so there are no hydrogens attached there.

Wait, actually, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is on C1, with C2 and C6 being the alpha carbons. Each of these alpha carbons has two hydrogens. So, in the chair conformation, the alpha hydrogens on C2 and C6 would each have one axial and one equatorial hydrogen. The axial hydrogens would be deshielded and would be next to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but in terms of splitting, each axial hydrogen on C2 would be next to the axial hydrogens on C3 and C1. But C1 doesn't have any hydrogens. So, maybe only the axial hydrogens on C2 would be next to the axial hydrogens on C3.

Wait, perhaps the splitting pattern is more about adjacent hydrogens on each carbon. So, each axial hydrogen on C2 would be split by the hydrogens on C3. If C3 has two axial hydrogens, then each axial hydrogen on C2 would be a triplet? No, because each is adjacent to two hydrogens on C3. Wait, but in a chair, each axial hydrogen on C2 is adjacent to one axial hydrogen on C3, because of the chair's structure.

Wait, maybe I need to draw this out mentally. In the chair conformation of cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is axial, pointing up. Then, C2 and C6 have equatorial hydrogens, and C3 and C5 have axial hydrogens.

Wait, no, the carbonyl group is usually axial in the chair conformation of cyclohexanone. So, the carbonyl oxygen is axial, pointing upwards. Then, the C2 and C6 positions have their hydrogens in the equatorial positions. C3 and C5 have their hydrogens axial, pointing towards the center of the ring.

Wait, so each axial hydrogen on C3 is adjacent to the axial hydrogens on C2 and C4. So, the axial hydrogens on C2 would be next to the axial hydrogens on C3. So, each axial hydrogen on C2 would be split by the axial hydrogen on C3, resulting in a doublet. Similarly, the equatorial hydrogen on C2 would be split by the equatorial hydrogens on C1 and C3, but C1 doesn't have any hydrogens. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps in the chair conformation, the alpha hydrogens (on C2 and C6) are each adjacent to two different sets of hydrogens: one on the same carbon and one on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but each alpha hydrogen is on C2, which is adjacent to C1 (carbonyl) and C3. So, the hydrogens on C2 would be adjacent to the hydrogens on C3. So, each alpha hydrogen on C2 would have one neighboring hydrogen on C3. Wait, but C3 has two hydrogens, so would each alpha hydrogen on C2 be split by both hydrogens on C3, leading to a triplet?

No, because each alpha hydrogen on C2 is adjacent to two hydrogens on C3 (if C3 has two axial hydrogens). So, each alpha hydrogen on C2 would be a triplet.

Wait, but the problem says the splitting is a doublet of doublets. So, maybe the hydrogen is adjacent to two different types of hydrogens, each causing a split.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is on C3. So, if the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone, then the C3 hydrogen is adjacent to C2 and C4. Each of these, in turn, has two hydrogens. So, the hydrogen on C3 would be split by the hydrogens on C2 and C4. If the hydrogens on C2 and C4 are each a pair, then the hydrogen on C3 would be split into a triplet from each adjacent carbon, but that would result in more than two splits.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Maybe product 2 is a bicyclic compound again, but with a different bridge. Or perhaps it's a tricyclic compound.

Wait, no, because after hydrogenation, product 1 would have been opened, and product 2 is fully hydrogenated, so it would be a monocyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a step back.

The starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. UV irradiation leads to product 1, same molecular weight, so same molecular formula, just a different structure. Then, product 1 is hydrogenated to form product 2.

I think the correct pathway is as follows:

1. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated, leading to a ring-opening to form a conjugated dienone, such as 3,5-cyclooctadienone.

2. Then, product 1 is hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2, which would reduce the double bonds, resulting in a fully saturated cyclohexane ring with a ketone group, specifically cyclohexanone.

But wait, the molecular formula of cyclohexanone is C6H10O, while the starting material is C8H12O. That doesn't match. So, that can't be. Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bridged bicyclic dienone, with the same number of carbons but different structure. Then, upon hydrogenation, it becomes a fully saturated bicyclic compound.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is the same structure but without the bridge. So, maybe it's a monocyclic compound with the same number of carbons but a different ring size.

Wait, perhaps the ring opens into a monocyclic compound with a double bond, but same number of carbons, so same molecular formula.

Wait, but then hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond, reducing the molecular formula by two hydrogens. But the problem says the molecular formula remains the same, so product 2 should have the same number of hydrogens as product 1, which is the same as the starting material.

Wait, no, the starting material is C8H12O, product 1 is also C8H12O, and product 2 is also C8H12O. So, hydrogenation doesn't change the molecular formula because it adds hydrogen without changing the number of carbons.

Wait, but if product 1 has a double bond, then product 2 would have that double bond turned into a single bond, which would actually increase the number of hydrogens by two, making the molecular formula C8H14O. But the problem says product 2 has the same molecular weight as the starting material, so it must still be C8H12O. Hence, product 1 cannot have any double bonds. So, that line of reasoning is invalid.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to consider that the first reaction is not a ring-opening but a [1,3]-shift of a carbonyl group, leading to a different bicyclic structure, such as bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-2-one. Then, product 1 is a dienone. But wait, that would have the same molecular formula.

Then, when product 1 is hydrogenated, the double bond would be reduced, adding two hydrogens, making product 2 as a fully saturated bicyclic compound with the same molecular formula as the starting material.

Wait, but the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, and after hydrogenation, product 2 would be a different bicyclic structure.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a [2+2] photocycloaddition across the bridge, forming a larger ring, but that would change the molecular formula.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for the splitting in product 2, regardless of the structure.

The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2, which is a doublet of doublets. So, this hydrogen is split by two different types of neighboring hydrogens, each with a different coupling constant.

In cyclopropane rings, for example, each hydrogen is adjacent to two others, leading to a triplet. But here, it's a doublet of doublets, so maybe the hydrogen is adjacent to two non-equivalent hydrogens.

Alternatively, in a benzene ring, each hydrogen is adjacent to two others, but in a conjugated diene, each hydrogen is adjacent to one other.

Wait, no, in a conjugated diene, each hydrogen is part of a double bond, so it's adjacent to one other hydrogen.

Wait, maybe in a bicyclic compound, the most deshielded hydrogen is at a bridgehead position, adjacent to two other bridgehead hydrogens, each causing a split.

Wait, but in bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, the bridgehead has one hydrogen. After ring-opening, perhaps it's in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has two adjacent hydrogens, each causing a split.

Wait, if the most deshielded hydrogen is next to two different sets of hydrogens, then it would be a doublet of doublets.

For example, in a cyclohexane ring with a substituent, the hydrogen next to the substituent would be adjacent to two different environments: one on the same carbon and one on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another example: in a cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens (on C2 and C6) are each adjacent to the ketone on C1. The alpha hydrogens on C2 are adjacent to the hydrogens on C1 (but C1 has no hydrogens) and the hydrogens on C3. Wait, C3 has two hydrogens. So, each
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about the photochemical reaction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one and then hydrogenation of the product. I need to determine the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum. 

First, let me recall what bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one looks like. It's a norbornane-like structure, but with a ketone group at position 2. So, it's a bicyclic compound with three bridgehead carbons. The structure has a bridge connecting all three carbons, making it quite rigid.

Now, the first reaction is irradiation with ultraviolet light. I remember that ketones, especially bridgehead ketones like this, undergo Norrish Type I or II reactions when irradiated. But wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bridged bicyclic ketone, so maybe it undergoes a different kind of photochemical reaction.

Wait, another thought: Under UV irradiation, bridgehead ketones can undergo a [2+2] photocycloaddition, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's an electrocyclic ring-opening. Or perhaps a Norrish Type I cleavage. Norrish Type I involves cleavage of the ketone group to form a biradical, leading to ring opening.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has a bridge, so upon Norrish Type I cleavage, it might break a bridge. Let me think. If the ketone group is at position 2, breaking the bridge would lead to a larger ring? Hmm, maybe. Let's think: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges each of two carbons. If the bridge between C1 and C2 breaks, perhaps it would open into a larger ring. Alternatively, maybe it cleaves into a smaller ring.

Wait, another possibility: the irradiation causes the ketone group to undergo a ring-opening. Since the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, upon irradiation, maybe it forms a diradical which can undergo a ring-opening to form something with a conjugated diene.

Wait, maybe it's a [4π] electrocyclic ring-opening. So, the ketone group is part of a bridge. If the bridge undergoes ring-opening via electrocyclic reaction, it might form a conjugated diene. Let me imagine the structure: if the bridge opens, the ketone might become part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage.

Alternatively, Norrish Type II involves hydrogen abstraction leading to a cleavage. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up common reactions of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one under UV light. I think that upon irradiation, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoes ring-opening to form a conjugated diene and a ketene or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ring-opened product, which is a diene. If that's the case, then product 1 is a diene compound with the same molecular weight as the starting material. Because if it's a ring-opening without loss or gain of atoms, the molecular weight remains the same.

So, starting with molecular formula C8H12O (since bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is C8H12O). If the ring opens, the product would be something like a diene with the ketone group still present. Hmm.

Wait, if it's a [2+2] photocycloaddition, it would form a four-membered ring, but that's not leading to a diene. Alternatively, maybe an electrocyclic ring-opening. For a bridge, opening might produce a conjugated diene. Let me think about the structure.

Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges, each with two carbons. If one bridge breaks, say the bridge between C1 and C2, which is the bridge adjacent to the ketone, then perhaps it would open into a larger ring. Wait, but that would give a monocyclic structure with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge is broken, and the ketone group is now part of a conjugated diene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the product.

Product 1 has the same molecular weight as the starting material, so it's likely an isomerization or ring-opening without loss or gain of atoms. So, the starting material is C8H12O. So, product 1 is also C8H12O.

If it's a ring-opening, maybe it becomes a diene with a ketone. Let me think: perhaps the bridge is broken, and the ketone becomes part of a conjugated diene. For example, maybe the product is a cycloheptene ring with a ketone.

Wait, no, that would change the number of rings. Alternatively, perhaps the bridge opens, and the ketone group is transformed into a double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but that usually requires heat. But UV irradiation can cause similar cleavage. So, if the starting material is a bicyclic ketone, upon irradiation, it might break a bridge, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, let me try to draw it mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges: between C1-C2, C2-C3, and C3-C1. The ketone is at C2. If the bridge between C1 and C2 breaks, that might lead to a structure with a longer chain. But I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone undergoes a Norrish Type I cleavage, which forms a biradical. That can lead to ring opening, perhaps forming a conjugated diene. So, the product 1 would be a diene with a ketone. Wait, but if you break the bridge, maybe the product is a monocyclic diene with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a [1,3]-shift or some rearrangement. Wait, maybe the most likely product is that the bridge breaks, and the ketone remains, so you get a longer chain with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-5-one or something like that. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for known reactions. Upon UV irradiation, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoes ring-opening to form 2-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5-one or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when a bridgehead ketone is irradiated, it can undergo a Norrish Type I cleavage, leading to a biradical, which can lead to ring opening. So, the bridgehead between C1 and C2 could break, leading to a larger ring. If the bridge between C1 and C2 breaks, the remaining structure would have a longer bridge.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-one. No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens into a conjugated diene, making the structure more like a monocyclic compound with a double bond and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexene with a ketone substituent. Let me count the carbons. The starting material is C8H12O. If you break a bridge, maybe you get C8H12O as well, but in a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diene, so a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone. Let's say it's cyclohex-2-en-5-one. That would be C7H10O, but our starting material is C8H12O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridged cycloheptene with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a retro-Diels-Alder, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR part. The final product is product 2, which is formed by hydrogenation of product 1. So product 1 must have a double bond or triple bond because hydrogenation would add hydrogen across it.

So, product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 would be the hydrogenated version, which would be a single bond.

Wait, then product 1 must be an alkene. So, the starting material is a ketone, and upon irradiation, it forms an alkene with the same molecular weight.

So, the starting material is C8H12O. Product 1 would have the same formula but with a double bond instead of a ring. So the product 1 is probably a diene or a monounsaturated compound.

If the starting material is a bridgehead ketone, irradiation would break a bridge, leading to a diene. So, maybe the product is a 1,3-diene with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opened product with a conjugated diene and a ketone. For example, a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a 2,5-cyclohexadien-4-one. That's cyclohex-2,5-dien-4-one, which is C6H8O. But the starting material is C8H12O, so that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a bicyclic diene. Let me think again. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has three bridges. If one bridge breaks, maybe it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar.

Wait, another approach: Molecular formula remains the same after irradiation, so product 1 is C8H12O. So, the starting material is a bicyclic ketone, and after ring-opening, it becomes a monocyclic diene with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene with a bridge. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-cyclohexene with a ketone group. But molecular formula wouldn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the ring opens, and a double bond is formed, but the molecular formula remains the same. So, starting from C8H12O, after ring-opening, it's still C8H12O but with a double bond.

So, product 1 would have a double bond, so its structure would be something like a cyclohexene ring with a ketone.

Wait, but if it's a bridgehead double bond, that's not possible. So, the double bond must be in a non-bridgehead position.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5-one. Let me count the carbons: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene would have 7 carbons, but we need 8. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a monocyclic diene with a ketone. Let's see: if we have a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone, that would be C6H10O. But we need C8H12O, so maybe it's a larger ring.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclooctenone. Cyclooctenone is cyclooct-2-en-1-one, which is C8H12O. Yes, that fits. So, product 1 is cyclooctenone, which has a double bond and a ketone. So, that makes sense.

So, starting from bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, upon UV irradiation, it undergoes ring-opening to form cyclooctenone. Then, when product 1 is hydrogenated, the double bond is saturated, so product 2 is cyclooctanone, which is a saturated cycloketone.

Wait, but wait: hydrogenation of a ketone doesn't change the ketone group, but it adds hydrogen to a double bond. So, if product 1 is cyclooctenone (C8H12O), then product 2 would be cyclooctanone (C8H14O). Wait, but the molecular weight would change. Hmm, the starting material is C8H12O, product 1 is also C8H12O, and product 2 is C8H14O. But the problem says that the molecular weight of product 1 is the same as the starting material, which it is. Then, product 2 has the same molecular weight as product 1, but when hydrogenated, it gains two hydrogens, so molecular weight increases by 2.

But the problem says that product 2 is formed by hydrogenation of product 1, but doesn't specify if the molecular weight changes. Actually, it just says that product 1 has the same molecular weight as the starting material. So, product 2 would have a higher molecular weight. But the question is about the NMR splitting pattern of product 2.

So, product 2 is cyclooctanone. Now, I need to find the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of cyclooctanone.

In cyclooctanone, the ketone group is at a certain position. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to the carbonyl group because of the electron-withdrawing effect. In a cycloketone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are typically deshielded.

In cyclooctanone, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent hydrogens are at positions 2 and 8. Each of these hydrogens (positions 2 and 8) would be deshielded. Now, in a cyclooctanone ring, each of these hydrogens is adjacent to the carbonyl and also has neighboring hydrogens.

Let me think: in cyclooctanone, each of the alpha hydrogens (positions 2 and 8) is next to two other hydrogens in the ring. Wait, no, each alpha hydrogen is next to two CH2 groups? Let me think about the structure.

Actually, cyclooctanone is a six-membered ring? No, wait, no. Wait, no, cyclooctanone is an eight-membered ring with a ketone. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The carbonyl is at position 1, so position 2 is the next carbon, position 8 is the carbon before position 1.

In cyclooctanone, each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2 and 8) has two neighboring carbons in the ring. So, position 2 is between 1 (carbonyl) and 3, and position 8 is between 7 and 1 (carbonyl). So, the hydrogens on positions 2 and 8 are each adjacent to two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, wait: in cyclooctanone, the structure is a ring where carbon 1 is the carbonyl, carbon 2 is a CH2 group, carbon 3 is a CH2, carbon 4 is a CH2, and so on, up to carbon 8, which is also a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, no, actually, in cyclooctanone, the ring is such that each carbon is CH2 except for the carbonyl. So, each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2 and 8) is CH2, with two CH2 groups next to them.

Wait, no, in cyclooctanone, it's an eight-membered ring with one ketone group. So, the structure is similar to cyclohexanone but with an eight-membered ring. So, the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 8) are each connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, but in reality, cyclooctanone is similar to cyclohexanone but with two more carbons in the ring. So, each of the alpha positions (2 and 8) is a CH2 group. So, each alpha hydrogen is on a CH2 that is adjacent to another CH2 group.

Now, in the NMR spectrum, the most deshielded hydrogens would be the alpha hydrogens (positions 2 and 8). Let's consider their splitting patterns.

Each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two sets of hydrogens. The hydrogen at position 2 is next to hydrogens at positions 1 (carbonyl, which is a C=O, no H), position 3, and position 8. Wait, position 1 is the carbonyl, so the hydrogen at position 2 is next to position 3 and position 1 (but position 1 has no H). Wait, no, in the ring, each CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. Let me imagine the chair-like structure of cyclooctanone. Wait, but cyclooctanone doesn't have a chair conformation like cyclohexanone because it's an eight-membered ring, which isn't as rigid.

Alternatively, it's a flat ring with the carbonyl group. Let me number the carbons as 1 (carbonyl), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, connected in a ring.

So, the alpha hydrogens are on carbons 2 and 8. Each of these carbons is connected to two other carbons. For carbon 2: connected to 1 (carbonyl) and 3. Carbon 3 is connected to 2 and 4. Similarly, carbon 8 is connected to 7 and 1 (carbonyl).

Wait, but that doesn't explain the hydrogens on 2 and 8. Each of these carbons (2 and 8) is a CH2 group, so each has two hydrogens.

Now, each hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent to hydrogens on carbon 3 and carbon 8? Wait, no, because in the ring, each CH2 is between two other CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the coupling between hydrogens. Each hydrogen on carbon 2 would be adjacent to hydrogens on carbons 3 and 1. But carbon 1 is the carbonyl, so it doesn't have hydrogens. So, the hydrogens on carbon 2 would only be adjacent to hydrogens on carbon 3.

Similarly, hydrogens on carbon 8 are adjacent to hydrogens on carbon 7.

Wait, that can't be right because in a ring, each hydrogen would have neighboring hydrogens on adjacent carbons. So, the hydrogens on carbon 2 would be adjacent to hydrogens on carbon 3 and carbon 1. But carbon 1 has no hydrogens. So, only adjacent to carbon 3. Similarly, hydrogens on carbon 8 are adjacent to hydrogens on carbon 7 and carbon 1 (no H). So, only adjacent to carbon 7.

Wait, but that would mean each hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent to only one hydrogen (on carbon 3), and the same for carbon 8. But that can't be, because in reality, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons, so each CH2 group has two adjacent CH2 groups, each with two hydrogens. So, each hydrogen on carbon 2 is next to two hydrogens on carbon 3 and two hydrogens on carbon 1. But carbon 1 has no hydrogens, so only adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 3. Similarly, each hydrogen on carbon 8 is adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 7.

Wait, that would mean each hydrogen on carbon 2 is vicinal to two hydrogens on carbon 3, and each hydrogen on carbon 8 is vicinal to two hydrogens on carbon 7. So, each hydrogen on 2 would have two neighboring hydrogens on carbon 3. Similarly, each hydrogen on 8 would have two neighboring hydrogens on carbon 7.

But in the NMR spectrum, each hydrogen's splitting depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens. So, for each hydrogen on carbon 2, it would see two hydrogens on carbon 3. But wait, are the hydrogens on carbon 2 and 3 adjacent? Yes, because carbon 2 is connected to carbon 3. So, the hydrogens on 2 and 3 are vicinal, meaning they are on adjacent carbons.

So, each hydrogen on carbon 2 would be adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 3. Similarly, each hydrogen on carbon 8 would be adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 7. So, each alpha hydrogen would be a doublet of doublets, because each is adjacent to two sets of two hydrogens.

Wait, no, because the coupling is between vicinal hydrogens. So, each hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 3, but are those two hydrogens equivalent? Let me think: in a ring, the hydrogens on carbon 3 may be equivalent if the ring is symmetric. Since cyclooctanone is symmetric across the carbonyl, the hydrogens on carbon 3 and carbon 5 (assuming numbering) would be equivalent.

Wait, no, in cyclooctanone, the ring is not symmetric in the same way as cyclohexanone. Let me try to imagine the structure. The carbonyl is at position 1, and the ring has eight members. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are 2 and 8. Then, carbons 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 follow around the ring.

Wait, in this case, the ring is symmetric because 8 and 2 are both adjacent to the carbonyl. So, carbons 3 and 7 would be equivalent, and carbons 4 and 6 would be equivalent, making the structure symmetric.

So, for the hydrogens on carbon 2: each hydrogen on 2 is adjacent to two hydrogens on carbon 3. Since carbons 3 and 7 are equivalent, the two hydrogens on 3 are equivalent. So, each hydrogen on 2 is adjacent to two equivalent hydrogens on carbon 3. Therefore, each hydrogen on 2 would have a triplet splitting due to coupling with two equivalent hydrogens. Similarly, each hydrogen on 8 would have a triplet from the two hydrogens on carbon 7.

But wait, in reality, each hydrogen on 2 is also adjacent to the hydrogens on carbon 8? No, because the ring is such that carbon 2 is connected to 1 and 3, not to 8. Similarly, carbon 8 is connected to 7 and 1.

Wait, then the hydrogens on 2 are only adjacent to hydrogens on 3, and the hydrogens on 8 are only adjacent to hydrogens on 7. So, each alpha hydrogen (on 2 and 8) would have two neighboring hydrogens (each on adjacent carbons). So, each alpha hydrogen would be adjacent to two hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the question says that the splitting pattern is a doublet of doublets, not a triplet. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogens on 2 are also adjacent to hydrogens on 8 via the ring. Wait, but in a ring, each hydrogen is next to its immediate neighbors, not across the ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between diastereotopic protons. Alternatively, maybe there's another factor.

Wait, another thought: in the ring, each hydrogen on position 2 is adjacent to the hydrogens on position 3, and also to the hydrogens on position 8, because the ring is cyclic. Wait, no, in a ring, each proton is adjacent only to its neighboring carbons, not across the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: in cyclooctanone, each alpha hydrogen (on 2 and 8) is next to two hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (3 and 7, respectively). So, each alpha hydrogen is split by two equivalent hydrogens, leading to a triplet. So, the NMR signal for each alpha hydrogen would be a triplet.

But the question says that the correct answer is a doublet of doublets. So, maybe I'm wrong in the structure. Perhaps product 2 is not cyclooctanone, but something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not cyclooctenone, but a different diene. Let me reconsider product 1.

If product 1 is a diene, then upon hydrogenation, it becomes a single bond. So, product 2 would have two single bonds where the double bonds were in product 1.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diene, then product 2 would have two single bonds, making it a fully saturated structure. So, maybe product 1 is a diene with two double bonds, but that's unlikely because the molecular formula remains the same upon irradiation, which would suggest a single double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, so product 2 would have two single bonds. Let me think: starting from bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, upon irradiation, it becomes a diene, say 1,3-cyclooctadiene or something similar. Then, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across each double bond, making it single bonds.

But wait, if product 1 is a diene, its molecular formula would be C8H10O, but the starting material is C8H12O. So, that doesn't fit because adding a double bond would reduce the number of hydrogens by two.

Therefore, product 1 must have a double bond, but the molecular formula remains the same, so it must lose two hydrogens from a single bond to form a double bond. Wait, no: forming a double bond from a single bond reduces the number of hydrogens by two, so the molecular formula would change. But in this case, product 1 has the same molecular formula as the starting material, so perhaps product 1 is an isomer with a double bond and a ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic diene. For example, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one irradiates to become bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-2-one. But that would mean the ketone is still there, and a double bond is formed.

But that would require the starting material to have a bridge, so upon ring-opening, a double bond is formed while maintaining the bridge. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a norbornene derivative, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the hydrogenation step. Product 2 is formed by hydrogenation of product 1. If product 1 has a double bond, then product 2 will have a single bond there. So, product 2 would be a fully saturated compound.

Assuming product 1 is cyclooctenone, then product 2 is cyclooctanone. Now, in cyclooctanone, the alpha hydrogens (on carbons 2 and 8) each have two neighboring hydrogens on adjacent carbons (3 and 7, respectively). So, each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

But the question says the splitting is a doublet of doublets. So, perhaps I'm missing that each alpha hydrogen is also adjacent to another set of hydrogens through the ring.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogens on carbons 2 and 8 are each adjacent to two hydrogens on their adjacent carbons (3 and 7), and also to hydrogens on the opposite side of the ring, but that's not possible because the ring is not that large. Alternatively, maybe there's another coupling.

Wait, another approach: in cyclooctanone, each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on the next carbon, but also to another set of hydrogens that are in a different position. For example, each alpha hydrogen might be adjacent to two hydrogens on one carbon and one hydrogen on another. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogens on 2 and 8 are each adjacent to two hydrogens on their adjacent carbons (3 and 7) and also to another hydrogen through a different pathway. Wait, but in a ring, each hydrogen is only adjacent to the immediate neighbors.

Wait, maybe it's a case of diastereotopic protons. For example, in a chair-like structure, the alpha hydrogens might have different environments, leading to different coupling constants. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misidentifying the most deshielded hydrogen. In cyclooctanone, the alpha hydrogens are the most deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. So, those are the ones we're considering.

If each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two equivalent hydrogens, it would be a triplet. But the question says it's a doublet of doublets. So, perhaps each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two sets of non-equivalent hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two different protons. For example, one on one carbon and another on a different carbon. But in the ring, each alpha hydrogen is only adjacent to hydrogens on the next carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the alpha hydrogens are each adjacent to two different sets of hydrogens. Maybe one set is on the adjacent carbon and another set is on a carbon two positions away.

Wait, that might happen if the ring has more carbons. For example, in cyclooctanone, the alpha hydrogen on carbon 2 is adjacent to carbon 3 and carbon 8. Wait, no, carbon 8 is on the other side of the ring. So, the hydrogens on 2 are adjacent to 3 and to 8? No, because in the ring, 2 is only adjacent to 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the connectivity. Let me try to write the connectivity:

1 (carbonyl) connected to 2 and 8.

2 connected to 1, 3.

3 connected to 2, 4.

4 connected to 3,5.

5 connected to 4,6.

6 connected to 5,7.

7 connected to 6,8.

8 connected to 7,1.

So, each CH2 group is between two CH2 groups. So, the hydrogens on 2 are adjacent only to those on 3, and those on 8 are adjacent only to those on 7.

Therefore, each alpha hydrogen is adjacent to two hydrogens on the next carbon. So, each alpha hydrogen would have two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet.

But the question says it's a doublet of doublets, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the product is different.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not cyclooctenone but a different diene. Let me think: if the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, upon irradiation, it could form a diene by breaking a bridge. For example, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5-one, but that's a seven-membered ring, which doesn't match the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it becomes a monocyclic diene with a bridge. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 has a bridge and a double bond. For example, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one could lose a ring to form a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5-one. That would have the same molecular formula, C8H12O, because it's just a ring contraction.

So, product 1 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5-one. Then, when hydrogenated, product 2 would be bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Now, I need to find the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the structure is similar to norbornane but with a ketone. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to the carbonyl group. Let's see: the ketone is at position 2, so the adjacent carbons are 1 and 3.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the carbons adjacent to the ketone are bridgeheads. So, the hydrogens on carbons 1 and 3 are the alpha hydrogens.

In norbornane, the bridgehead hydrogens are typically deshielded. So, in product 2, the bridgehead hydrogens adjacent to the ketone would be the most deshielded.

Now, let's consider their splitting patterns. Each bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to hydrogens on the adjacent bridgehead carbons. Let me think about the structure.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the structure has three bridges: between carbons 1-2, 1-4, and 4-2. Wait, not sure. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two of two carbons and one of one carbon. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with two bridges.

Wait, no: bicyclo[m.n.p] has three bridges. So, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two of two carbons and one of one carbon. So, the structure is like a norbornane, where the bridge between carbons 1-2 is two carbons, 1-4 is two carbons, and 2-4 is one carbon.

In this structure, the ketone is at carbon 2. So, the adjacent carbons are 1 and 3. Wait, no: in bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the ketone is at position 2, so the adjacent carbons are 1, 3, and 4 (since bridgeheads are 1, 2, 4).

Wait, no, the bridgeheads are 1, 2, and 4 in norbornane-like structures. So, in bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the carbonyl is at position 2, and the bridgeheads are 1, 2, and 4.

So, the hydrogens on carbons 1, 3, and 5 are the alpha hydrogens (assuming the carbonyl is at 2). Wait, no, the alpha hydrogens are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl, so that's carbons 1 and 3.

Wait, in this structure, carbon 2 is the ketone, so carbons 1 and 3 are adjacent to it.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, carbon 1 is connected to 2, 5, and 6. Carbon 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5.

Wait, no, perhaps I should look at the connectivity.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the structure is norbornane-like with bridges. So, the carbons are arranged such that carbon 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 5. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the NMR splitting pattern. The most deshielded hydrogens are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl, which are the bridgehead hydrogens. Each bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to two other hydrogens on the adjacent bridgeheads.

In norbornane, the bridgehead hydrogens are each adjacent to two other hydrogens on the adjacent bridgeheads. So, each bridgehead hydrogen would have two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet. But the question says it's a doublet of doublets.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with hydrogens on different bridges. For example, each bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to hydrogens on two different bridges, each giving a different coupling constant, leading to a doublet of doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps each bridgehead hydrogen is adjacent to two non-equivalent hydrogens, each on a different bridge, leading to a doublet of doublets.

Yes, that makes sense. So, in bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, the bridgehead hydrogen at position 1 is adjacent to two different sets of hydrogens: one on the adjacent bridgehead carbon (position 2, which is the ketone, so no H) and another on a non-adjacent bridge
