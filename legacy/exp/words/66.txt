There is a multiple-choice question: An ARMA(p,q) (p, q are integers bigger than zero) model will have. The options are: A. An acf and pacf that both decline geometrically, B. An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after p lags, C. An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags, D. An acf that is zero after p lags and a pacf that is zero after q lags. Why the correct answer is: D. An acf that is zero after p lags and a pacf that is zero after q lags?
