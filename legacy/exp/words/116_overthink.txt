Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, I should recall that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are vectors for each particle. The dot product S_i·S_j involves the scalar product, which can be written as (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). But since these are spin-1/2 particles, the total spin operators might come into play. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the total spin squared operator S_total^2, which is equal to S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That seems related because in the Hamiltonian, we have a sum of S_i·S_j terms.

So if I let H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then H can be rewritten in terms of S_total^2. Let me see: S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Plugging this into H, H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). 

Since each S_i is a spin-1/2 particle, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². Therefore, substituting back into H: H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)*(9/4)ħ² = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ².

So H can be written as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ². That seems useful because if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H will have a simple expectation value.

Now, I should check if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2. To do that, I need to find the total spin squared of psi. The state psi is symmetric in a way, since it's a combination of having two up spins and one down spin, and all cyclic permutations. Let me write down the state:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Each of these terms has two spins up and one spin down. So the total spin number for each term is... the total spin projection is 1/2 * 1/2 * 2 - 1/2 * 1/2 * 0? Wait, no, spin projections are additive. Each spin up contributes +1/2, spin down contributes -1/2. So for each term, the total spin projection along z-axis is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2 in each state.

But that's the z-component. The total spin squared is a scalar quantity, so it's about the magnitude of the total spin vector. So the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is s(s+1)ħ², where s is the total spin.

But what is the total spin here? The state psi is a combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let me think: each term has two up spins and one down spin. The total spin S_z for each term is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So the z-component is 1/2, but what is the total spin s?

To find s, I need to see if these states can form a multiplet. Let me consider the possible total spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be s = 3/2 or s = 1/2.

Wait, but let's think about what these states look like. Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So their S_z is 1/2. So the states in psi have S_z = 1/2. Are these part of the s = 3/2 multiplet or s = 1/2 multiplet?

In the s = 3/2 multiplet, the maximum m_s is 3/2. But all the states in our psi have m_s = 1/2. So they must be part of the s = 1/2 multiplet. Because in the s = 1/2 multiplet, the m_s can be +1/2 or -1/2. Our state is all m_s = 1/2, but wait, that can't be, because each term in our state has m_s = 1/2, but there are three different states. So in the s = 1/2 multiplet, how many states are there? For each s, there are (2s + 1) states. So for s=1/2, m_s = 1/2, -1/2, and 0? Wait no, wait: For s=1/2, the possible m_s are +1/2 and -1/2, no 0? Wait no, wait, that's for s=1/2. No, actually, wait: for any spin s, m_s ranges from -s to +s in integer steps. So for s=1/2, m_s can be -1/2 and +1/2. So the multiplet for s=1/2 has two states.

But wait, our state psi has three terms. So it can't be a part of the s=1/2 multiplet because that has only two states. Therefore, it must be part of the s=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, but hold on: the s=3/2 multiplet has four states with m_s = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. So if our state is in the s=3/2 multiplet, it's part of them, but our state has m_s = 1/2.

But wait, how many states in the s=3/2 multiplet have m_s = 1/2? For s=3/2, each m_s corresponds to a number of states equal to (2s - |m_s|). So for m_s = 1/2, the number of states is 3/2 * 2 - 1/2 = 3 - 1 = 2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, for each m_s, the number of states is given by (2s - |m_s| + 1). So for s=3/2 and m_s=1/2, it's (2*(3/2) - 1/2 + 1) = 3 - 0.5 + 1 = 3.5? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the state in terms of the total spin states. But maybe another way: think about the singlet and triplet states for two spins and then extend to three spins.

Wait, but I'm dealing with three spins here. Maybe I can consider the state as a symmetric combination. Since all the terms in psi are symmetric under permutation, it's a symmetric state.

Wait, each of the three terms in psi is two up and one down, in all possible positions. So this is like a symmetric combination of such states.

But in the symmetric subspace, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of the total spin states.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total spin squared operator acting on psi and see if it gives a multiple of identity, which would imply that psi is an eigenstate.

So perhaps I'll compute S_total^2 |psi>.

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). We already have this expression.

Since we're dealing with spin 1/2 particles, S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ² for each i.

Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 9/4 ħ².

So S_total² = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

So H = A*(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ².

So if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² on psi, then I can compute H.

Now, let's compute S_total² |psi>.

Wait, but computing S_total² |psi> would be tedious because it's a sum of terms. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since all the terms in psi have two up spins and one down spin, we can consider the action of S_total² on each term.

But perhaps it's better to note the total spin squared for such a state.

Suppose that the state psi is in a subspace with a certain total spin s.

Given that each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down, the total spin projection is 1/2. But the total spin squared eigenvalue depends on s(s+1)ħ².

If we can determine the value of s for the state psi, then we can find the eigenvalue.

Wait, but how? Maybe by examining the possible states.

Wait, with three spin-1/2 particles, we can have s = 3/2 or s = 1/2.

But in our case, each term in psi has m_s = 1/2. So the state is in a subspace where m_s = 1/2.

But both the s=3/2 and s=1/2 multiplets have states with m_s=1/2.

Wait, for s=3/2, m_s can be -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2.

But our state is all m_s=1/2, but each term is a different permutation. So in s=3/2, the m_s=1/2 subspace has dimension (2s - m_s + 1) = 2*(3/2) - 1/2 + 1 = 3 - 0.5 + 1 = 3.5, which can't be, since dimensions must be integer. Hmm, maybe my formula is wrong.

Wait, actually, the multiplicity for a given m_s in spin s is (2s - |m_s| + 1). So for s=3/2 and m_s=1/2, the multiplicity is 2*(3/2) - 1/2 + 1 = 3 - 0.5 + 1 = 3.5, which is not an integer. So that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I have to think in terms of how many states have m_s=1/2. For s=3/2, m_s can be 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2, so only one state with m_s=3/2, one with m_s=1/2, etc. So for each m_s, there's only one state in the s=3/2 multiplet. Similarly, for s=1/2, only two states: m_s=1/2 and m_s=-1/2.

Wait, no, wait: For s=3/2, the number of states is 2s +1 = 4, so m_s = -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2. Similarly, for s=1/2, it's 2s +1 = 2 states: m_s = -1/2, +1/2.

So in the s=3/2 multiplet, each m_s has only one state. Similarly, for s=1/2 multiplet, two states, each with m_s = ±1/2.

So our state psi is a combination of three different states with m_s=1/2. So if psi is in s=3/2 multiplet, then m_s=1/2 subspace has only one state, so psi can't be entirely within it because it's a combination of three different states. Therefore, psi is not in the s=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, but that seems contradictory. Because the three terms in psi are all different states with m_s=1/2, but in the s=3/2 multiplet, only one state has m_s=1/2.

Therefore, they can't all be in s=3/2. So perhaps psi is in the s=1/2 multiplet.

But in s=1/2, the states with m_s=1/2 and m_s=-1/2. So if our state psi is a combination of three different states with m_s=1/2, but in s=1/2, there's only one state with m_s=1/2. Therefore, it can't be in s=1/2 either.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is a symmetric combination of three different m_s=1/2 states, which might not be part of a single multiplet. Hmm.

Wait, actually, each of these three terms |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ have different m_s=1/2.

But in the s=3/2 multiplet, for m_s=1/2, there's only one state. So perhaps these three terms are not in a single multiplet, so maybe this is a combination beyond just the multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is a combination of different multiplets.

Wait, but it's given as a normalized state, so it must lie in a specific subspace.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the action of S_total² on psi.

Let's try that.

First, let me write psi as a vector. But since we're dealing with spin states, maybe we can consider the spin states in the computational basis.

The state psi is 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ).

So let me represent this as a vector in the Hilbert space. Each spin has two possible states, so the total state space is 8-dimensional. But our state psi is in a subspace of dimension 3, since it's a combination of three basis states.

Wait, but maybe I can write S_total² in terms of the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express S_total² in terms of the individual spin components and then compute its expectation value on psi.

But that might be computationally intensive. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² by looking at the norm of S_total acting on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the singlet and triplet states for two spins and see if that can help.

Wait, since we have three spins, maybe I can pair two spins and consider their total spin, then include the third spin.

But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the state psi in terms of the total spin.

Wait, since in each term, two spins are up and one is down, the total spin is adding two spins up and one spin down.

Wait, each spin is 1/2. So if I have two spins up and one spin down, the total spin would be something like (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) in the z-direction, but that's just the projection.

To find the total spin, perhaps calculate (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 and compute its expectation value on psi.

Wait, since S_total² is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so the expectation value is <psi | S_total² | psi>.

Expanding S_total², it's equal to S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So the expectation value is <psi | S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) | psi>.

Since S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ², that part is easy. So the first term is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

The second part is 2 times the sum of the dot products. So let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

So let me compute <psi | S_i·S_j | psi> for each pair (i,j).

But wait, each S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

So the expectation value of S_i·S_j is (1/2) [ <psi | S_i^x S_j^x | psi> + <psi | S_i^y S_j^y | psi> + <psi | S_i^z S_j^z | psi> ].

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can compute the expectation value of S_total² directly.

Wait, another thought: if I can find a state that is an eigenstate of S_total², then I can easily compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state psi is symmetric under permutation of spins. Therefore, it might be an eigenstate of the permutation group operators.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total² on each term of psi.

Let me think about this: each term in psi is a product state with two spins up and one spin down.

So let me take one term, say |↑↑↓⟩, and compute S_total² acting on it.

Wait, S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Expanding the square, it's S1² |↑↑↓⟩ + S2² |↑↑↓⟩ + S3² |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

But since S1² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, same for S2² and S3².

So S1² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, same for S2² and S3².

So S1² + S2² + S3² acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is (9/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, the cross terms: 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)|↑↑↓⟩.

But each term acts on the respective spins.

Let's compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩.

S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩: The spin x operator for each spin flips up to down or vice versa. So S1^x acting on |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, and S2^x acting on |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩. So S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩. Then, when we apply this to |↑↑↓⟩, since S1^x S2^x flips both spins 1 and 2, we get |↓↓↓⟩. Similarly, S1^y S2^y is more complicated because it involves imaginary terms, but perhaps for expectation values, the real part might be zero.

Wait, but we're not computing expectation value; we're computing the action of the operator on the state.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ can be found by recalling that S^y = -i (S^x - S^z)/2. So perhaps S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = -i (S1^x S2^x - S1^z S2^z)/2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But I might be overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that for two spins, the singlet and triplet states can be defined as:

|singlet⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2),

|triplet_m=1⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

|triplet_m=0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2),

|triplet_m=-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

So when two spins are in a triplet state, their S1·S2 has expectation value (1/2)ħ², and for the singlet state, it's (-1/2)ħ².

Wait, that's a useful point. So for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

The eigenvalues for S1·S2 are (1/2)ħ² for the triplet states and (-1/2)ħ² for the singlet state.

Therefore, for each term |↑↑↓⟩, when considering S1·S2, if the first two spins are |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet state, then S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, wait: S1·S2 acts on the two spins, so for |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ because |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet with S1·S2 = (1/2)ħ².

Similarly, if the two spins were in a singlet state, the eigenvalue would be (-1/2)ħ².

So, for our state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acting on it is (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S1·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩: spins 1 and 3 are in |↑↓⟩. The state |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet with S1·S3 = (1/2)ħ². Therefore, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩: spins 2 and 3 are in |↑↓⟩, so S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, putting it all together:

S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1² + S2² + S3²) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩

= (9/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2*(3*(1/2)ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩

= (9/4 ħ² + 3 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩

= (9/4 + 12/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

= (21/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Wait, but that seems too large. Wait, hold on:

Wait, S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = [S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is [ (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4) ħ² + 2*( (1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) ) ħ² ] |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is [ (9/4) ħ² + 2*(3/2) ħ² ] = (9/4 + 3) ħ² = (21/4) ħ².

So yeah, that's correct.

Similarly, the same would apply for the other terms |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩ because each has two spins in a triplet-like state.

Therefore, if I apply S_total² to each term in psi, it would be 21/4 ħ² times that term.

So S_total² |psi⟩ = (21/4 ħ²) |psi⟩.

Wait, so that means psi is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue (21/4) ħ². But wait, 21/4 is 5.25, which is (s(s+1)) for s=5/2, but s must be a half-integer or integer.

Wait, s(s+1) must be an integer times ħ², but 21/4 is 5.25, which is not an integer. So that can't be, because S_total² must have eigenvalues s(s+1)ħ², where s is integer or half-integer.

Therefore, my previous approach must have a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the cross terms.

Hold on, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So when I act on |↑↑↓⟩, the first part is 9/4 ħ² as before, and the cross terms are 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

For each of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3, acting on |↑↑↓⟩, we have two spins in triplet states. So for S1·S2, it's (1/2)ħ² as before. Similarly, S1·S3 is (1/2)ħ², and S2·S3 is (1/2)ħ².

Therefore, the sum is 3*(1/2)ħ² = 3/2 ħ².

So S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(3/2 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 3 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4 + 12/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = 21/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

So same as before.

But 21/4 is not a possible eigenvalue for S_total² since s must be an integer or half-integer. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misrepresenting the eigenstates.

Wait, the problem is that when I have two spins in a triplet state, S1·S2 has eigenvalue (1/2)ħ², but in the context of three spins, the cross terms might not all be simultaneously acting on the same state.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption that S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩. But in reality, S1·S2 is an operator that acts on spins 1 and 2, leaving spin 3 untouched. So when it acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it gives (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, which is correct. Similarly for S1·S3, which acts on spins 1 and 3, giving (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, and same for S2·S3.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but it's leading to an impossible conclusion.

Wait, but why can't the eigenvalue be 21/4? Because the eigenvalues of S_total² must be s(s+1)ħ², where s is the total spin. So 21/4 is 5.25, which is not an integer multiple of 1/2.

Wait, 21/4 is 5.25, so s(s+1) = 5.25, so s^2 + s - 5.25 = 0, s = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 21)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(22)]/2. Hmm, not a half-integer. Therefore, something is wrong.

Therefore, my assumption that each cross term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ is incorrect.

Wait, think again: when acting on |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acts on spins 1 and 2, resulting in (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩. Similarly, S1·S3 acts on spins 1 and 3, resulting in (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, and S2·S3 acts on spins 2 and 3, resulting in (1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

But wait, if that's the case, then each of these cross terms contributes (1/2)ħ² times the same state, so adding up, as I did before.

But then the eigenvalue comes out as 21/4 ħ², which is problematic.

Wait, maybe that's because the state |↑↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate of S_total²? But wait, S_total² acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives 21/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, so it is an eigenstate?

But then, why is that eigenvalue not a possible multiple of ħ²?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the eigenvalue.

Wait, let me think differently: for two spins in a triplet state, their total spin is 1, so S1·S2 = (1/2)ħ².

But when we have three spins, maybe the contribution is different.

Wait, let me think about the total spin for the entire system. If I have three spins, each 1/2, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But in our case, each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down, so the total spin projection is 1/2.

But as we've seen, the state psi is a symmetric combination of three different states with m_s=1/2.

So perhaps the state psi is a part of a larger multiplet, or maybe the combination leads to a different total spin.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_total², but an eigenstate of each S_i·S_j.

But the problem is asking about H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so if I can find the expectation value of H, which is A times the sum of the expectations of S_i·S_j.

So perhaps I don't need to find the eigenvalue of S_total², but just compute the expectation values of each S_i·S_j.

So let's try that approach.

Given psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>, <psi | S1·S3 | psi>, and <psi | S2·S3 | psi>, then sum them up and multiply by A.

So let's compute <S1·S2> first.

As before, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So the expectation value is (1/2)(<S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z>).

Compute each term.

First, <S1^z S2^z>:

In the state psi, each term is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. So for S1^z S2^z, in each term, S1^z is +1/2 and S2^z is +1/2 for the first term, +1/2 and -1/2 for the second term, and -1/2 and +1/2 for the third term.

Wait, no, in each term:

- |↑↑↓⟩: S1^z=+1/2, S2^z=+1/2, S3^z=-1/2.

- |↑↓↑⟩: S1^z=+1/2, S2^z=-1/2, S3^z=+1/2.

- |↓↑↑⟩: S1^z=-1/2, S2^z=+1/2, S3^z=+1/2.

So for <S1^z S2^z>:

Each term in psi is (1/sqrt(3)) multiplied by one of these basis states. So the expectation is the sum over the three terms of (1/sqrt(3))^2 times the product of S1^z and S2^z for each term.

So:

Term 1: (1/sqrt(3))^2 * (1/2)(1/2) = 1/3 * 1/4 = 1/12.

Term 2: (1/sqrt(3))^2 * (1/2)(-1/2) = 1/3 * (-1/4) = -1/12.

Term 3: (1/sqrt(3))^2 * (-1/2)(1/2) = 1/3 * (-1/4) = -1/12.

So summing them up: 1/12 -1/12 -1/12 = -1/12.

So <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12.

Similarly, compute <S1^x S2^x>.

But S1^x and S2^x are spin-flipping operators. When acting on |↑⟩, S^x gives |↓⟩, and when acting on |↓⟩, S^x gives |↑⟩.

So let's compute S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, S2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.


--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what its energy is. If not, we need to find the expectation value of E.

First, I remember that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are for each particle, and each has spin 1/2. The state ψ is given as a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. So, ψ has a total spin of S = 1/2, because it's two up and one down.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think. Each spin is 1/2, so two spins up and one down. The maximum total spin would be 3*(1/2) = 3/2, but in this case, since we have two up and one down, the total spin could be S = 1/2 or S = 3/2, depending on how the spins are aligned.

But actually, in the state ψ, the spins are arranged such that each term has exactly two ups and one down, but in different positions. So, this is a symmetric state under permutation of the particles. Therefore, ψ is symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two particles.

Now, the Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of the spin operators. Remember that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2). Since S_i and S_j are spin-1/2 particles, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

But maybe there's a better way. I recall that for multiple spin-1/2 particles, the total spin squared is S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I denote H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then I can write H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2).

Given that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ², so plugging in:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²).

So, H is proportional to S_total^2.

Therefore, the eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_total^2. So, if the state ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it is also an eigenstate of H.

So, let me compute S_total^2 acting on ψ.

First, what is the total spin S_total for the state ψ? Since ψ has two spins up and one spin down, the total spin S_total can be either S = 1/2 or S = 3/2.

Wait, let's see. The maximum possible spin is 3/2 if all are up, but here only two are up and one is down. So, it's a mixed state of S=3/2 and S=1/2?

Wait, no. If you have two up and one down, the possible total spin is either S=1/2 or S=3/2 depending on the configuration. But ψ is a specific combination.

Let me compute S_total^2 for ψ. Alternatively, maybe compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Alternatively, think about the possible states with two up and one down. Let's consider the possible total spins.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2, 1/2.

Now, the state ψ is symmetric under permutation of particles. So, let's consider the total spin. If all three spins are up, that's S=3/2, but ψ has two up and one down, so it's not in that state.

Alternatively, the state ψ is a symmetric combination of two up and one down. Let me recall that for three particles, the symmetric states with two up and one down can be either in the spin 1/2 subspace or spin 3/2 subspace.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if we can compute S_total^2 ψ, maybe that would help.

But the problem is, I don't know the explicit form of S1, S2, S3 matrices, but maybe I can use the fact that ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for ψ.

Let me think about the possible eigenvalues of S_total^2. For three spin-1/2 particles, S_total can be 3/2 or 1/2. So, the eigenvalues of S_total^2 would be S(S+1)ħ², so for S=3/2, it's (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = (15/4)ħ², and for S=1/2, it's (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

So, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But wait, ψ has two spins up and one down. Let me think about what the S=3/2 state looks like.

The S=3/2 state for three spins is a singlet state with maximum spin.

But for two up and one down, maybe the S=3/2 state is different from the one we have. Alternatively, the S=1/2 state with two up and one down.

Wait, perhaps we can consider the possible ways of combining spins.

Let me recall that for three spins, the states with two up and one down can be either symmetric or antisymmetric. Since ψ is symmetric, it must be in the symmetric subspace.

In the symmetric subspace, the possible total spin is S=1/2 or S=3/2. Hmm, but with only two up and one down, is that possible?

Wait, no. For three spins, if you have two up and one down, the total spin can't be 3/2 because 3/2 requires all three spins to be aligned. So, actually, in this case, the total spin must be 1/2.

Wait, let me think. If you have two up spins and one down spin, the possible total spin S is 1/2 or 3/2. But can it really be 3/2?

No, because 3/2 requires all three spins to be up. If one is down, the maximum spin is 1/2. Because you can't have all three spins aligned.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, each spin is 1/2, so with two up and one down, you can still have total spin of 3/2?

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum total spin is achieved when all spins are up, which is 3/2. If you have one down, can the total spin still be 3/2? Let me compute.

Suppose two spins are up, and one is down. The total spin would be 1/2. Because you're combining two up and one down. The two up spins can combine to 1/2 or 3/2, but when you combine with a down spin, which is -1/2, the total spin can be either:

For two up spins: S = 1/2 or 3/2.

When combining with a down spin (S_z = -1/2):

If the two up spins are in a triplet state (S=1/2), combining with a down spin would give a total S = 1/2 (since 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but with opposite orientation, it might result in S=0 or S=1? Wait, no, because S is the total spin, which is a vector. So, when combining S=1/2 and S=1/2, the possible total S can be 1 or 0.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of group theory or use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

But without knowing the matrix elements, maybe a different approach is better.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible eigenvalues of S_total^2. For a state with two up and one down spin, what is the possible S_total^2 eigenvalue?

Wait, since the system is symmetric under exchange, the state ψ is in the symmetric subspace. So, in the symmetric subspace, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

If ψ is in the 1/2 subspace, then S_total^2 |ψ> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² |ψ> = (3/4)ħ² |ψ>.

If ψ is in the 3/2 subspace, then S_total^2 |ψ> = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² |ψ> = (15/4)ħ² |ψ>.

But which is the case here?

Wait, if ψ is symmetric, let's think about the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in two spin systems, two spins can form a triplet (S=1) or a singlet (S=0). For three spins, it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, but ψ is a symmetric state with two up and one down. So, perhaps it's in the S=1/2 subspace.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H, which is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, let's compute the expectation value <ψ|H|ψ> = A*(<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + <ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + <ψ|S2·S3|ψ>).

Therefore, we can compute each term separately.

First, let's compute <S1·S2>.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4)ħ².

Similarly for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>.

So, let's compute <(S1 + S2)^2>.

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>.

But since S1 and S2 are spin-1/2, <S1^2> = <S2^2> = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore,

<(S1 + S2)^2> = (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> = (3/2)ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>.

Thus,

<S1·S2> = [<(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/2)ħ²]/2.

So, plugging back into <S1·S2>:

<S1·S2> = [ ( <(S1 + S2)^2> ) - (3/2)ħ² ] /2.

So, from that, we can write:

<S1·S2> = [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/2)ħ² ] /2.

Therefore, to compute <S1·S2>, we need to compute <(S1 + S2)^2>.

But (S1 + S2)^2 acting on ψ will give a scalar value? Wait, no, it's an operator, so its expectation value is a scalar.

Alternatively, since (S1 + S2)^2 is an operator, we can compute its expectation value on the state ψ.

Similarly for (S1 + S3)^2 and (S2 + S3)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 directly.

But that might not be easier.

Alternatively, let's consider that the expectation value of S1·S2 is equal to ( <S1_z S2_z> + <S1_x S2_x> + <S1_y S2_y> ). Similarly for the others.

But computing this might be complicated.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the spin singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in two spin-1/2 systems, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ². The eigenvalues of S1·S2 are (1/2)(S(S+1) - 3/4)ħ², which gives for S=0: (1/2)(0 - 3/4) = -3/8 ħ², and for S=1: (1/2)(2 - 3/4) = (1/2)(5/4) = 5/8 ħ².

So, if we can determine whether the state ψ in the two-spin subsystems is a singlet or triplet, we can find the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

But wait, in our case, the state ψ is a three-spin state. So, it's not just about two spins; it's about how the three spins behave.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the singlet and triplet nature in pairs.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the possible expectation values.

Given that the state ψ is symmetric, it has certain symmetries that can help. Let me write the state:

ψ = 1/√3 ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Each term has two up spins and one down spin, and the state is symmetric under permutation.

So, for any pair of particles, say particles 1 and 2, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be calculated.

Let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2 for ψ.

Note that S1·S2 = (S1_z S2_z + S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y).

So, since each term in ψ has specific spin directions, I can compute the expectation value term by term.

First, compute <S1_z S2_z>:

In each term of ψ, the spins of particles 1 and 2:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = +1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

2. |↑↓↑⟩: S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = -1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (-1/4).

3. |↓↑↑⟩: S1_z = -1/2, S2_z = +1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (-1/4).

So, average over the three terms:

(1/3)[ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12.

Similarly, compute <S1_x S2_x> and <S1_y S2_y>.

Recall that S_x = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/√2 and S_y = (-i)(|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/√2.

So, S_x and S_y are related to spin-flips.

Now, let me compute the expectation value of S1_x S2_x in each term:

In |↑↑↓⟩:

S1_x acting on |↑⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/√2 * |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/√2, but wait, no.

Wait, S1_x |↑⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/√2 |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/√2. Wait, no, actually:

S1_x |↑⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/√2 |↑⟩ = (0 + |↓⟩)/√2 = |↓⟩/√2.

Similarly, S2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩/√2.

So, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩/√2)(|↓⟩/√2) |↓⟩ = |↓⟩|↓⟩ / 2 * |↓⟩ = |↓⟩ / 2.

But wait, actually, let me think again.

No, let me recall that S1_x S2_x is an operator, so it acts on the combined state.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value <ψ| S1_x S2_x |ψ>.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to use the fact that for the singlet state, <S1_x S2_x> is known.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, in the singlet state |S=0>, we have:

<S_x S_x> = (⟨S1_x S2_x⟩) = ( (-1/2) ) ( (-1/2) ) ? No, wait.

Wait, actually, for the singlet state, S1·S2 = - (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z = -3/4 ħ².

But for the singlet state, we have <S1·S2> = -3/4 ħ².

But in our case, we have three-spin state, so it's not a singlet state of any two spins.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute <S1_i S2_i> for each i.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps consider that for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), the expectation value of S_i·S_j is the same due to symmetry.

Given that the state is symmetric under permutation, each pair will have the same expectation value.

Therefore, <ψ| S1·S2 |ψ> = <ψ| S1·S3 |ψ> = <ψ| S2·S3 |ψ>.

So, all three terms will be equal, so <H> = A*(3 * <ψ| S1·S2 |ψ> ).

Thus, if I compute <S1·S2>, multiply by three and by A, I get the expectation value.

Therefore, let's compute <S1·S2>:

First, we can compute <S1_z S2_z> as we did before, which was -1/12.

Now, compute <S1_x S2_x> + <S1_y S2_y>.

Let me compute <S1_x S2_x>:

Note that S1_x and S2_x are operators acting on particles 1 and 2, respectively.

Let me write ψ as:

ψ = 1/√3 ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

So, ψ can be written as:

ψ = 1/√3 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Let me compute <ψ| S1_x S2_x |ψ>.

So,

<ψ| S1_x S2_x |ψ> = 1/3 [ <↑↑↓| S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↑↓| S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ + <↑↑↓| S1_x S2_x |↓↑↑⟩

Similarly for the other terms.

But this seems complicated. Let me see if I can find a better way.

Alternatively, note that S1_x S2_x is a product of Pauli matrices.

In two spin-1/2 systems, S1_x S2_x can be written as (σ_x ⊗ σ_x)/4, since each σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, but scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, actually, S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, so S1_x S2_x = (ħ/2)^2 (σ_x ⊗ σ_x).

Therefore, <S1_x S2_x> = (ħ^2 /4) <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>.

So, if I can compute <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> for the state ψ, then I can find <S1_x S2_x>.

Similarly, <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> is the expectation value of σ_x on particles 1 and σ_x on particles 2.

Given that ψ is a symmetric state, perhaps we can compute <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> by inspecting the structure.

But maybe it's easier to compute <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> directly.

So, let me write out the action of σ_x on each spin state.

σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, for each term in ψ, which is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩:

Compute <ψ| (σ_x ⊗ σ_x) |ψ>.

First, note that ψ is a vector, so |ψ> is:

( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / √3.

Therefore, <ψ| (σ_x ⊗ σ_x) |ψ> is:

(1/3) [ <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ + <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩

+ <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ + <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩

+ <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ + <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ + <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Now, compute each term.

First term: <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩

σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

So, <↑↑↓| ↓↓↓⟩ = 0, since they are orthogonal.

Second term: <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩

σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Third term: <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩

σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

So, <↑↑↓| ↑↑↑⟩ = 0.

Fourth term: <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩

σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

So, <↑↓↑| ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Fifth term: <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩

σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, <↑↓↑| ↓↑↑⟩ = √3/3? Wait, no.

Wait, no, <↑↓↑| ↓↑↑⟩ is the inner product of |↑↓↑⟩ with |↓↑↑⟩.

But wait, the first component is up, the second is down, the third is up.

The second term is |↓↑↑⟩, which is down, up, up.

So, their inner product is zero because the first components differ (↑ vs ↓).

So, fifth term is zero.

Sixth term: <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩

σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

So, <↑↓↑| ↑↑↑⟩: the first component is ↑ vs ↑ (same), second is ↓ vs ↑ (different), third is same. So, inner product is zero.

Seventh term: <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩

σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

So, <↓↑↑| ↓↓↓⟩: all components are ↓, but the second component of |↓↑↑⟩ is ↑, while the second component of |↓↓↓⟩ is ↓. So, inner product is zero.

Eighth term: <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩

σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, <↓↑↑| ↓↑↑⟩: first component is ↓ vs ↓ (same), second and third are ↑ vs ↑ (same). So, this is 1.

Ninth term: <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩

σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

So, <↓↑↑| ↑↑↑⟩: first component is ↓ vs ↑ (different), others same. So, inner product is zero.

Therefore, all terms except the eighth term are zero.

So, <ψ| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |ψ> = (1/3)(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0) = 1/3.

Similarly, since σ_x and σ_y are similar, but with a factor of i, but since we are dealing with real states, the expectation value of σ_y ⊗ σ_y will be zero? Wait, no, because σ_y is complex.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, actually, the expectation value is real because the state is real.

Wait, let me think. σ_y is -i σ_x, so σ_y ⊗ σ_y = (-i)^2 σ_x ⊗ σ_x = -σ_x ⊗ σ_x.

So, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = - <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>.

But since our state is real, the expectation value <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> is equal to the complex conjugate of - <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>, which is the same as - <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> if the state is real.

Wait, but I need to check the expectation value for σ_y.

Alternatively, perhaps compute <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> directly.

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe note that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y is equal to (S1 · S2)_xx + (S1 · S2)_yy.

But since S1 · S2 is a scalar, perhaps we can compute it differently.

Wait, actually, let's recall that S1 · S2 = (S1_z S2_z + S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y).

We already computed <S1_z S2_z> = -1/12.

If I can find <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y>, then I can add that to -1/12 to get <S1·S2>.

So, let's compute <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y>.

Earlier, we found that <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = 1/3.

But σ_y = -i σ_x, so σ_y ⊗ σ_y = (-i)^2 σ_x ⊗ σ_x = -σ_x ⊗ σ_x.

Therefore, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = - <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = -1/3.

But wait, is that correct?

Wait, wait. Actually, S1_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so S1_y S2_y = (ħ^2 /4) σ_y ⊗ σ_y.

Therefore, <S1_y S2_y> = (ħ^2 /4) <σ_y ⊗ σ_y>.

Similarly, <S1_x S2_x> = (ħ^2 /4) <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>.

So, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = (ħ^2 /4) ( <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> + <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> ).

But since σ_y = -i σ_x, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = < (-i σ_x) ⊗ (-i σ_x) > = (-i)^2 <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = (-1)(-1) <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>.

Wait, no, (-i)^2 = (-i)(-i) = i² = -1.

So, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = (-i)^2 <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = (-1) <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>.

Therefore, <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> + <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> - <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = 0.

Therefore, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = (ħ^2 /4)(0) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, even though <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> is 1/3, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> is -1/3, so their sum is zero.

Therefore, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = 0.

So, going back, <S1·S2> = <S1_z S2_z> + <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = (-1/12) + 0 = -1/12.

Wait, that can't be right because for two spin-1/2 particles, in the singlet state, S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ², which is about -0.75 ħ², which is much larger in magnitude than -1/12.

But in our case, the state isn't a two-spin singlet, but a three-spin state.

Wait, but we found that the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state ψ is -1/12? That seems possible because the state isn't a two-spin state, but a three-spin symmetric state.

Wait, let's check again.

We had:

For <S1·S2>: <S1_z S2_z> = -1/12, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = 0.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = -1/12 ħ².

Wait, because S1 and S2 are spin-1/2 operators, so S1_z has eigenvalues ±1/2, S1 is spin 1/2, so S1·S2 is in units of ħ².

So, <S1·S2> is -1/12 ħ².

So, each <S_i·S_j> = -1/12 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H is:

<H> = A*( -1/12 ħ² + -1/12 ħ² + -1/12 ħ² ) = A*(-3/12) ħ² = A*(-1/4) ħ².

Wait, that's -A/4 ħ².

But wait, the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, that doesn't match. So, either my computation is wrong or my reasoning is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating <σ_x ⊗ σ_x>. Let's double-check that.

Earlier, when computing <ψ| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |ψ>, I found that only the eighth term was non-zero, which was 1/3.

But wait, let me verify that.

Looking at ψ, which is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

Compute each term:

1. <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = <↑↑↓| ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

2. <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

3. <↑↑↓| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = <↑↑↓| ↑↑↑⟩ = 0.

4. <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = <↑↓↑| ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

5. <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = <↑↓↑| ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

6. <↑↓↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = <↑↓↑| ↑↑↑⟩ = 0.

7. <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↑↓⟩ = <↓↑↑| ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

8. <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↑↓↑⟩ = <↓↑↑| ↓↑↑⟩ = 1.

9. <↓↑↑| σ_x ⊗ σ_x |↓↑↑⟩ = <↓↑↑| ↑↑↑⟩ = 0.

Therefore, total is 1/3.

So, <σ_x ⊗ σ_x> = 1/3.

Therefore, <S1_x S2_x> = (ħ² /4) * 1/3 = ħ² /12.

Similarly, <σ_y ⊗ σ_y> = -1/3, as before.

Therefore, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = (ħ² /12) + (- ħ² /12) = 0.

So, indeed, <S1·S2> = <S1_z S2_z> + <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> = (-1/12) + 0 = -1/12.

Thus, <H> = A*(3*(-1/12)) = A*(-1/4) = -A/4.

But wait, the expected answer is 2/3 A ħ², so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Remember that S_i are spin operators with units of ħ.

Wait, in my calculation, I didn't include the ħ² factor.

Wait, no. Let me see. S1·S2 is in units of ħ², because each S_i has units of ħ.

So, S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ², which has units of ħ².

Therefore, in my expectation value, I computed numbers without the ħ².

Wait, in my earlier steps:

<S1_z S2_z> was computed as (-1/12), which is actually (-1/12)ħ².

Similarly, <S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y> was zero.

Therefore
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a given Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state is given as psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to check if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find its energy. If not, find the expectation value of E. The correct answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*hbar^2, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what the dot product of spin operators means. S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2. That's a standard identity. So, applying that to each term in the Hamiltonian:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*[ (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 + (1/2)(S1 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S3^2 + (1/2)(S2 + S3)^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor this differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)[(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Yes, that might be a cleaner approach. Let me verify that:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 gives:

(1/2)[(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)]

Therefore, H = A*(1/2)[(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

That seems useful. So H can be written in terms of the total spin squared (S_total^2) minus the sum of squares.

I know that for spin 1/2 particles, each S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, the sum S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Now, S_total^2 is the square of the total spin operator. If the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H can be easily evaluated.

So, first, I need to check if the given state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

What's the state psi? Let me write it out:

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

So, it's a symmetric state under permutation of the spins, but not entirely symmetric because the third particle is always down. Wait, let me see:

Each term has two up spins and one down spin, but arranged in different positions. So it's symmetric under permutation of the particles, but since each term has a different arrangement, it's not a totally symmetric state. Wait, actually, is it symmetric?

If we swap particles 1 and 2, |↑↑↓⟩ becomes |↑↑↓⟩, same as before. Similarly, |↑↓↑⟩ becomes |↓↑↑⟩ when swapping 1 and 2, which is another term in the state. So, psi is symmetric under permutation of the particles. So, is psi an eigenstate of S_total^2?

I think so because S_total^2 commutes with the permutation group, so if the state is symmetric, it should be an eigenstate.

But wait, is it symmetric? Let me see. If all the terms in psi are symmetric, then yes, the entire state is symmetric. Because each term has two up and one down spin, and each term is just a permutation of the others. So, swapping particles doesn't change the state. Therefore, it's symmetric.

Therefore, the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2. So, to find the eigenvalue, I need to compute S_total^2 |psi>.

But how do I compute S_total^2? Let me recall that S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

But acting on the state |↑↑↓⟩, etc., might be complicated. Maybe I can compute S_total^2 in terms of individual spins, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a state with total spin S, S_total^2 |psi⟩ = S(S + 1)ħ² |psi⟩.

So, if I can find the total spin S of the state, then I can find S_total^2.

How to determine the spin multiplicity of psi?

Let me think. The state psi is a combination of three states with two up spins and one down spin. So, perhaps it's a triplet state? Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But wait, in this case, the state is symmetric. So, if the state is symmetric, it should be in the triplet representation, which has spin 3/2. But wait, is that true?

Wait, when dealing with three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states would form the spin 3/2 multiplet, which has dimension (2S + 1) = 4. So, the triplet has four states, but psi is only three terms. So, perhaps it's a subspace.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the total spin S of psi by looking at the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the value of S_total^2 on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 acting on psi. Let's try that.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 is the total spin angular momentum operator. So, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already know that the sum S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 is (9/4)ħ², as each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ².

So, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But our Hamiltonian is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = A*(sum of dot products) = A*( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2

So, H = (A/2)*( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ² )

Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of (S_total)^2 on psi, I can compute H psi.

So, let's compute (S_total)^2 |psi>

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

So, S_total^2 |psi> = (sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j) |psi>

We already know sum S_i^2 = (9/4)ħ² |psi>

So, S_total^2 |psi> = (9/4)ħ² |psi> + 2 sum_{i < j} S_i·S_j |psi>

But 2 sum_{i < j} S_i·S_j is equal to 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = 2H/A |psi> * A.

Wait, no. Wait, H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). So, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) = 2H / A.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (9/4)ħ² |psi> + (2H / A) |psi>

Therefore, (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²) |psi> = (2H / A) |psi>

So, 2H |psi> = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²) |psi>

Thus, H psi = (A/(2)) (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²) psi

But earlier, we have H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²). So, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H psi is proportional to psi. Therefore, psi is an eigenstate of H.

So, let me compute S_total^2 |psi>

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on |psi>

Given that |psi> = ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

So, to compute S_total^2 |psi>, I can compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

First, let's note that each spin operator S_i acts on each particle's state. So, for example, S1 acts on the first particle, S2 on the second, and S3 on the third.

But perhaps it's easier to compute S_total^2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩, etc., and then add the contributions.

Let me compute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |↑↑↓⟩

Each S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ², so S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, similarly for S2^2 and S3^2.

So, sum S_i^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Now, the cross terms: 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩

Let's compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S1·S2 + S1^2 + S2^2 - S1·S2)? Wait, no, sorry, that's not the identity.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2

Wait, actually, better yet, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2 )

But maybe that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

We can write S1·S2 = S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z.

So, let's compute each component.

First, S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩, because S1_z acting on |↑⟩ is (1/2)ħ.

Similarly, S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩

So, S1_z S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Now, S1_x and S2_x: the spin raising and lowering operators.

S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓⟩, and S2_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1_y |↑⟩ = -i (ħ/2) |↓⟩, and S2_y |↑⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so S1_y S2_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩ = (-1)(ħ²/4)|↓↓↓⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y = (ħ²/4)|↓↓↓⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S1_z S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ + 0 = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, let's compute S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

First, S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩, S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1_z S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Now, S1_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩:

S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S3_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩.

So, S1_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩ (ħ/2)|↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ acting on the first and third particles.

Similarly, S1_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩:

S1_y |↑⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S3_y |↓⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↑⟩.

So, S1_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

So, S1_x S3_x + S1_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ = 0.

Therefore, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩:

Compute S2_z S3_z |↑↑↓⟩: S2_z |↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ)|↑⟩, S3_z |↓⟩ = (-1/2 ħ)|↓⟩.

So, S2_z S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, S2_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩:

S2_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S3_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩.

So, S2_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩ (ħ/2)|↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S2_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩:

S2_y |↑⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S3_y |↓⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↑⟩.

So, S2_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S2_x S3_x + S2_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑⟩ = 0.

So, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, sum_{i < j} S_i·S_j |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (1/4) - (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

So, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = sum S_i^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 sum S_i·S_j |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4 - 1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (7/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, that seems odd. The eigenvalue is 7/4 ħ², but for three spin 1/2 particles, the maximum total spin squared is (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (15/4)ħ². So, 7/4 is less than 15/4, so it's possible.

But wait, let me check my computation again.

Wait, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = sum S_i^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 sum S_i·S_j |↑↑↓⟩.

Sum S_i^2 is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Then 2 sum S_i·S_j |↑↑↓⟩. Wait, in the computation above, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*( (1/4) - (1/4) - (1/4) ) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ - 1/2 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (7/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Hmm, okay.

Similarly, let's compute S_total^2 |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩.

By symmetry, they should all have the same eigenvalue.

Because the state psi is symmetric, permuting the spins doesn't change the state. So, S_total^2 acting on any of these terms should give the same result.

Therefore, S_total^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (7/4) ħ² |↑↓↑⟩

And same for |↓↑↑⟩.

So, now, let's compute S_total^2 |psi⟩.

|psi⟩ = ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

So, S_total^2 |psi⟩ = [ S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S_total^2 |↑↓↑⟩ + S_total^2 |↓↑↑⟩ ] / sqrt(3)

Each term is (7/4) ħ² times the respective basis vector, so:

S_total^2 |psi⟩ = (7/4 ħ²) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ] / sqrt(3) = (7/4 ħ²) |psi⟩

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi⟩ = (7/4) ħ² |psi⟩.

So, going back to the Hamiltonian:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4) ħ² )

Thus, H |psi⟩ = (A/2)[ (7/4) ħ² - (9/4) ħ² ] |psi⟩ = (A/2)[ (-2/4) ħ² ] |psi⟩ = (A/2)( -1/2 ħ² ) |psi⟩ = (-A/4) ħ² |psi⟩

Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be positive 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check S_total^2 |psi⟩ again.

I found S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (7/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

But wait, let me verify this computation because 7/4 seems low.

Wait, for |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin is not all up, so the total spin squared is less than (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

But 7/4 is still less than that, but is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms.

Wait, let me recompute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Which is S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, I have already computed that S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Then, the cross terms:

2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩

Previously, I found S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 1/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

So, sum S_i·S_j |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, total S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ - 1/2 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (7/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Yes, that seems correct.

Similarly, S_total^2 |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩ would each give 7/4 ħ².

Thus, when I compute S_total^2 |psi⟩, it's (7/4 ħ²) times |psi⟩. Therefore, H |psi⟩ = (A/2)(7/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) |psi⟩ = (A/2)( -2/4 ħ² ) |psi⟩ = (-A/4) ħ² |psi⟩

Wait, but this is negative, whereas the supposed energy is positive 2/3 A ħ².

So, that's a problem. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the state is not in the correct spin state. Alternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation in S_total^2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps instead of computing S_total^2, I can compute the eigenvalue of H directly.

Wait, another idea: perhaps to compute the expectation value of H in the state psi.

The expectation value ⟨H⟩ = ⟨psi| H |psi⟩ = A ⟨psi| (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi⟩

So, let me compute each term: ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, ⟨S2·S3⟩

So, first, compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

For spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is given by:

⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/2)[ (⟨S_i^2⟩ + ⟨S_j^2⟩ - ⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ ) ]

For each pair (i, j), the state is a symmetric combination of two up and one down.

So, for ⟨S1·S2⟩:

Compute ⟨S1^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ², same for ⟨S2^2⟩.

Compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2⟩ = (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩

So, ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = (3/2) ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩

Thus,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)[ (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² - (3/2 ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩) ]

= (1/2)[ (3/2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ²) - 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ ]

= (1/2)[ 0 - 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ ] = (1/2)( -2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ ) = - ⟨S1·S2⟩

So, this gives us that ⟨S1·S2⟩ = - ⟨S1·S2⟩, which would imply that ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 0.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ directly.

Alternative approach: S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2

Thus, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - (1/2)(⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩)

So, if I can compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩, then I can find ⟨S1·S2⟩.

But to compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩, note that (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩

Which gives:

⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (3/2) ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩

But we also have:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - (1/2)(3/4 + 3/4) ħ²

= (1/2)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩) - (3/8) ħ²

So substituting:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(3/2 ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ ) - (3/8) ħ²

= (3/4) ħ² + ⟨S1·S2⟩ - (3/8) ħ²

So, bringing terms together:

⟨S1·S2⟩ - ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (3/4 - 3/8) ħ²

0 = (3/8) ħ²

Wait, that's a problem. That suggests that my approach is inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I need to compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ directly.

Compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = ⟨(S1 + S2)_x^2 + (S1 + S2)_y^2 + (S1 + S2)_z^2⟩

But since the state is |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩, perhaps it's easier to compute average of (S1 + S2)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the state is symmetric, so the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2 would be the same for any pair.

Wait, actually, each pair has the same expectation.

So, for the state |psi⟩, which is symmetric, the expectation of S1·S2 is the same as S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Each term in |psi⟩ has exactly two up spins and one down.

Let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Note that for each term in |psi⟩:

In |↑↑↓⟩, S1_z S2_z = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = 1/4 ħ², and the other components (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y) average to zero because the spin states are symmetric? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for each term.

So, for |↑↑↓⟩:

⟨↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² + ⟨↑↑↓| S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y |↑↑↓⟩

As computed before, the latter expectation is zero, because S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives |↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓↓⟩ which cancels out.

Similarly, same for |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ for each term is 1/4 ħ².

But since |psi⟩ is a symmetric combination, the expectation value is the average over all three terms.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/3)(1/4 ħ² + 1/4 ħ² + 1/4 ħ²) = (1/4) ħ².

Wait, that seems different from my previous attempt.

Wait, no. Wait, the state |psi⟩ is a superposition of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. Each term is orthogonal, so the expectation value for each term is separate.

So, for |↑↑↓⟩, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 1/4 ħ²

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, S1 and S2 are in different positions, but the computation would be the same.

Wait, no. Wait, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up. So, S1·S2 = S1_z S2_z + S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y.

In this case, S1_z S2_z = (1/2)(-1/2) ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

Similarly, the other terms: S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↑⟩

But wait, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, and S2_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, so S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |↑↓↑⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩ = 0

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ for |↑↓↑⟩ is S1_z S2_z = -1/4 ħ².

Similarly, for |↓↑↑⟩, S1_z S2_z = (-1/2)(1/2) ħ² = -1/4 ħ².

But wait, for |↓↑↑⟩, S1 is down, S2 is up, S3 is up.

So, S1_z S2_z = (-1/2)(1/2) ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

But S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y for |↓↑↑⟩:

S1_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, S2_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so S1_x S2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩

Similarly, S1_y |↓⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↑⟩, S2_y |↑⟩ = -i (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so S1_y S2_y |↓↑↑⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y |↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩ = 0

Thus, ⟨S1·S2⟩ for |↓↑↑⟩ is -1/4 ħ².

So, putting this all together:

|psi⟩ = ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ ⟨↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|S1·S2|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|S1·S2|↓↑↑⟩ ] / 3

From above, each term is 1/4, -1/4, -1/4 ħ².

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ² /3 = (-1/4) ħ² /3 = (-1/12) ħ²

Similarly, ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩ are the same due to symmetry.

So, each expectation value is (-1/12)
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a given Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what the energy is. If not, we need to find the expectation value of E. The answer is given as it being an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*ħ², but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall some properties of spin operators. Each Si is the spin operator for particle i, which is a vector operator. The dot product S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Specifically, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²). Similarly for the other terms. So, maybe I can rewrite H in terms of the total spin squared operator.

Let me write H as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). If I factor this expression, perhaps I can express it in terms of the total spin squared.

Wait, let's see. Let me consider the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. That's equal to (S1 + S2 + S3)² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) all over 2. Because (S_total)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, solving for the sum, we get:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ). 

But each Si² is (s(s+1))ħ² where s=1/2 for each particle. So, S1² = (3/4)ħ², same for S2² and S3². So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². 

Thus, H = A*( (S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 ). So, H = (A/2)(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

But wait, since the system is made of spin 1/2 particles, what is the possible total spin? For two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S = 1 or S = 0. But here we have three particles, so the total spin can range. Let me think. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2. How does that happen? Because each addition is a bit more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as adding two spins first. If I have two spin-1/2 particles, their total spin can be 1 or 0. Then, adding a third spin-1/2 particle.

So, suppose the first two have total spin S12 = 1 or 0. Then adding the third spin:

- If S12 = 1, adding another spin-1/2 can give S_total = 3/2 or 1/2.

- If S12 = 0, adding another spin-1/2 can only give S_total = 1/2.

So, overall, possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Therefore, the total spin S_total can be either 3/2 or 1/2.

But in our state psi, let me see what the total spin is. Maybe I can figure out whether psi is symmetric or antisymmetric under certain operations, which might help determine its total spin.

Looking at psi: it's a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. Specifically, each term has two up spins and one down spin, and all possible permutations.

Wait, in the state psi, each term is a product of two up spins and one down spin in different positions. So, for example, up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, down1 up2 up3. It's symmetric under permutation of the particles, I think.

Wait, if I swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the first term, just swapping the first two. Similarly, the second term becomes down2 up1 up3, which is the same as the third term. The third term becomes up1 down2 up3, which is the second term. So, the state is symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2.

Similarly, swapping 1 and 3, the first term becomes down3 up1 up2, which is the third term. The second term becomes up3 down2 up1, which is the first term. The third term becomes up1 up2 down3, which is the first term. So, same thing. So, it's symmetric under exchange of any two particles.

Therefore, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of all three spins. So, it's a totally symmetric state. Now, does that tell me about the total spin?

In the case of multiple particles, a symmetric state can be associated with higher total spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, a symmetric state would have total spin S_total = 3/2. Because the totally symmetric state corresponds to the maximum total spin.

Wait, but let me confirm that. When you have three spin-1/2 particles, the totally symmetric state is the state with maximum total spin, which is 3/2.

Alternatively, the antisymmetric state would have total spin 1/2. Wait, actually, the antisymmetric state is for spin 1/2 total, and symmetric for spin 3/2? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, in general, for bosons, symmetric states are for integer spins, and for fermions, antisymmetric. But here, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, so they are fermions. Therefore, the state must be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, in our case, the state psi is symmetric.

Wait, this seems contradictory. If the particles are fermions, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of particles. But the spin part can be symmetric if the spatial part is antisymmetric.

But in this problem, we are only given the spin state. So, if the spin state is symmetric, then the overall wavefunction would need to be antisymmetric, meaning the spatial part must be antisymmetric. But in this problem, I think we are only considering the spin part. So, perhaps the state psi is symmetric, which would be allowed if there is an antisymmetric spatial part.

But maybe in this problem, we can assume that the spatial part is symmetric? Or perhaps that the particles are arranged in a way that the spatial part is symmetric. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the spin state alone. For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin state corresponds to S_total = 3/2, and the antisymmetric corresponds to S_total = 1/2. So, if psi is symmetric, it must be in the S_total = 3/2 multiplet.

Thus, in our case, since the state is symmetric, it's part of the S_total = 3/2 representation. Therefore, S_total² acting on psi would give ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ² = (15/4)ħ².

Wait, but let me make sure. If the total spin is S_total, then S_total² = S(S+1)ħ². So, S_total² |psi> = [S(S+1)ħ²] |psi>. If S=3/2, then S_total² |psi> = (15/4)ħ² |psi>.

So, going back to H, which is (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²). So, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

Therefore, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue (15/4)ħ², then H|psi> = (A/2)( (15/4 ħ²) - (9/4 ħ²) ) |psi> = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) |psi> = (A/2)*(3/2 ħ²) |psi> = (3/4 A ħ²) |psi>. Wait, but the given eigenvalue is (2/3) A ħ². Hmm, that seems different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go again.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²). As I computed before, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

So, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

If |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ².

Since |psi> is a symmetric spin state, which corresponds to S = 3/2. So, S_total² |psi> = ( (3/2)(5/2) ) ħ² |psi> = (15/4) ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, H|psi> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) |psi> = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) |psi> = (A/2)*(3/2 ħ²) |psi> = (3/4 A ħ²) |psi>.

But wait, the given eigenvalue is 2/3 A ħ². So, either I have a miscalculation here, or maybe the state is not in the S_total = 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the state is not in the S_total = 3/2 multiplet. Because, in the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin. Let me check the total spin of this state.

Another approach: Let me compute the total spin S_total squared expectation value for psi.

Since S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2H.

Because H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). Therefore, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) = 2H/A.

Therefore, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2H/A.

So, rearranged, 2H/A = S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²).

Thus, H = (A/2)(S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)).

Which is the same as before.

But to get the expectation value of H, we can compute <H> = (A/2)( <S_total²> - <S1² + S2² + S3²> ).

We know that <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = (3/4)ħ², because each spin is 1/2.

Therefore, <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

So, <H> = (A/2)( <S_total²> - 9/4 ħ² ).

Thus, if we can find <S_total²>, we can find <H>.

So, let's compute <S_total²> for psi.

We can do this by expanding S_total².

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, <S_total²> = <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We already know <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> = 9/4 ħ².

So, we need to compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

But let's compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

The expectation value of S1·S2 is <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Similarly for the others.

But S1·S2 is (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²).

Wait, but we can compute it in another way.

Alternatively, S1·S2 can be expressed as (1/2)(S1·S2 + S2·S1) = (1/2)(S1·S2 + S2·S1) = S1·S2, which is symmetric.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value <S1·S2> as follows.

In spin 1/2 systems, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/2)(1 + cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between the two spins. However, since we are dealing with a pure spin state, we can compute it via the identity.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute <S1·S2> using the fact that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²).

But since we don't know S_total² for psi, perhaps we can compute it.

Wait, actually, let's compute <S1·S2> in another way.

In the state psi, which is a symmetric combination of states with two up and one down.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin.

So, for each term, say up1 up2 down3, let's compute <S1·S2>.

But S1·S2 is the dot product of the spin vectors of particles 1 and 2.

The eigenvalues of S1·S2 for two spin 1/2 particles are:

- When the two spins are parallel: eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

- When the two spins are antiparallel: eigenvalue (1/2)(0 + 1) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, no. Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²).

So, for two particles, the eigenvalues are:

If spins are aligned (spin 1), S_total² = 2(2+1) ħ² = 6 ħ². So, S1·S2 = (1/2)(6 ħ² - (3/4 ħ²) - (3/4 ħ²)) = (1/2)(6 - 3/2 - 3/2) ħ² = (1/2)(6 - 3) ħ² = (3/2) ħ².

Similarly, if spins are anti-aligned (spin 0), S_total² = 0, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(0 - 3/4 - 3/4) ħ² = (1/2)(-3/2) ħ² = (-3/4) ħ².

But in our state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, in each term, particles 1 and 2 are both up, which are aligned, so S1·S2 in that term would have eigenvalue (3/4) ħ². Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the eigenvalue is (3/4) ħ² when the two spins are aligned.

Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the operator S1·S2 for two spin 1/2 particles can be written as (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²). The eigenvalues are:

If the two spins are in a singlet state (S=0), then S_total² = 0, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(0 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²) = (1/2)(-3/2 ħ²) = (-3/4) ħ².

If the two spins are in a triplet state (S=1), then S_total² = 2(2+1) ħ² = 6 ħ², so S1·S2 = (1/2)(6 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²) = (1/2)(6 - 3/2) ħ² = (3/2) ħ².

So, in our state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin.

Let me consider the term up1 up2 down3.

In this term, S1 and S2 are both up, so they are aligned. So, S1·S2 in this term has eigenvalue (3/2) ħ².

Similarly, in the term up1 down2 up3, S1 and S2 are in a singlet-like state because S1 is up and S2 is down. So, in this term, S1·S2 would have eigenvalue (-3/4) ħ².

Similarly, for the term down1 up2 up3, S1 is down and S2 is up, so again, S1·S2 is in a singlet-like state, eigenvalue (-3/4) ħ².

Wait, so in the state psi, each of the three terms has different contributions. The first term has S1·S2 eigenvalue (3/2) ħ², and the other two terms have S1·S2 eigenvalue (-3/4) ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> would be:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = [ (1/sqrt(3))² * (3/2 ħ² + (-3/4) ħ² + (-3/4) ħ² ) ].

Wait, hold on. Let me see.

Each term in psi is a product state. So, when we compute <S1·S2>, it's the expectation value in each term, multiplied by the probability of being in that term.

But since psi is an equal superposition, each term has probability 1/3.

So, it's (1/3)*<up1 up2 down3| S1·S2 |up1 up2 down3> + (1/3)*<up1 down2 up3| S1·S2 |up1 down2 up3> + (1/3)*<down1 up2 up3| S1·S2 |down1 up2 up3>.

We already know for the first term, S1 and S2 are aligned, so <S1·S2> = 3/2 ħ².

For the second term, S1 and S2 are in opposite states, so <S1·S2> = -3/4 ħ².

Similarly, for the third term, S1 and S2 are opposite, so <S1·S2> = -3/4 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value is:

(1/3)*(3/2 ħ²) + (1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) + (1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) =

= (1/3)*(3/2) + (1/3)*(-3/4) + (1/3)*(-3/4)

= (1/2) + (-1/4) + (-1/4)

= (1/2 - 1/4 - 1/4) = 0.

Wait, the expectation value <S1·S2> is zero?

That can't be. Because in the first term, S1 and S2 are aligned, contributing positively, while in the other two terms, they are anti-aligned, contributing negatively.

But because there are two terms where S1 and S2 are anti-aligned, and one term where they are aligned, their contributions would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, leading to a net zero expectation value.

Hmm, okay, that seems a bit odd, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me check:

Each term in psi has an equal probability of 1/3. The first term has S1 and S2 aligned, giving +3/2 ħ², and the other two terms have S1 and S2 anti-aligned, giving -3/4 ħ² each.

So:

(1/3)(3/2) + (1/3)(-3/4) + (1/3)(-3/4) = (3/6) + (-3/12) + (-3/12) = (1/2) - (1/4) - (1/4) = 0.

Yes, it does work out to zero.

So, <S1·S2> = 0.

Similarly, what about <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>?

Let me compute <S1·S3> for the same state.

Take the first term: up1 up2 down3.

Here, S1 is up and S3 is down. So, S1·S3 in this term would be (-3/4) ħ², because they are opposite.

Similarly, for the second term: up1 down2 up3.

Here, S1 is up and S3 is up. So, S1·S3 is (3/2) ħ².

Third term: down1 up2 up3.

Here, S1 is down and S3 is up, so S1·S3 is (-3/4) ħ².

Thus, <S1·S3> is:

(1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) + (1/3)*(3/2 ħ²) + (1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) =

= (-3/12) + (9/12) + (-3/12) = ( (-3 + 9 -3)/12 ) ħ² = (3/12) ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Wait, so <S1·S3> = 1/4 ħ².

Similarly, what about <S2·S3>?

Let's compute that.

First term: up1 up2 down3.

Here, S2 is up and S3 is down. So, S2·S3 is (-3/4) ħ².

Second term: up1 down2 up3.

S2 is down and S3 is up, so S2·S3 is (-3/4) ħ².

Third term: down1 up2 up3.

S2 is up and S3 is up, so S2·S3 is (3/2) ħ².

Therefore, <S2·S3> is:

(1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) + (1/3)*(-3/4 ħ²) + (1/3)*(3/2 ħ²) =

= (-3/12 -3/12 + 9/12) ħ² = (3/12) ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

So, <S2·S3> = 1/4 ħ².

Therefore, the total expectation value <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> is:

<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> = 0 + 1/4 ħ² + 1/4 ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So, going back to the expectation value of H:

<H> = (A/2)( <S_total²> - 9/4 ħ² )

But we also have:

< S_total² > = <S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(1/2 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ² + ħ² = (9/4 + 4/4) ħ² = 13/4 ħ².

Therefore, <S_total²> = 13/4 ħ².

Hence, <H> = (A/2)(13/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(4/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(ħ² ) = (A/2) ħ².

Wait, but the given answer was 2/3 A ħ². So, this contradicts the given answer. Hmm, something is wrong here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of <S_total²>.

We have:

<S_total²> = <S1² + S2² + S3²> + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(1/2 ħ²) = 9/4 + 1 = 13/4 ħ². That seems correct.

Thus, <H> = (A/2)(13/4 - 9/4) ħ² = (A/2)(4/4) ħ² = A/2 ħ².

But according to the given answer, it should be 2/3 A ħ², so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I didn't calculate <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> correctly.

Earlier, I found that <S1·S2> = 0, <S1·S3> = 1/4 ħ², and <S2·S3> = 1/4 ħ². So, total <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 1/2 ħ².

But let me think about another approach. Since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²).

Thus, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

If |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total², then <H> = (A/2)(<S_total²> - 9/4 ħ²).

But in the given state, is |psi> an eigenstate of S_total²?

If not, then <H> is not equal to the eigenvalue.

But earlier, I thought that because the state is symmetric, it's part of the S_total = 3/2 multiplet, but apparently, the expectation value of S_total² is 13/4 ħ², which corresponds to a state with S_total = (sqrt(13)/2) ħ, which is not a half-integer. So, that's impossible.

Wait, S_total must be a multiple of 1/2, because we're dealing with spin 1/2 particles. So, the possible S_total values are 3/2 and 1/2.

So, 13/4 is (3.25)/1, which is not a multiple of 1/2 in terms of the square. Wait, S_total² must be S(S+1) ħ², so S(S+1) must be a multiple of 1/4.

Wait, 13/4 is 3.25, which is not of the form n(n+1)/4 where n is integer. The possible S_total² are:

For S=3/2: (3/2)(5/2) = 15/4 ħ².

For S=1/2: (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4 ħ².

So, 13/4 is not one of these. Hmm, that suggests that |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total², which would make sense because the Hamiltonian H doesn't commute with S_total², unless H is a function of S_total².

Wait, no, H is a function of S_total². Because H is written in terms of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is a function of S_total².

Wait, so H is (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

Therefore, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total², then it's also an eigenstate of H, with eigenvalue (A/2)(s(s+1) - 9/4) ħ².

But earlier, I saw that <S_total²> = 13/4 ħ².

However, 13/4 is not a possible value for S_total² for S=3/2 or S=1/2.

For S=3/2: S_total² = 15/4 ħ².

For S=1/2: S_total² = 3/4 ħ².

So, 13/4 is not a possible eigenvalue for S_total² when acting on |psi>. Therefore, |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total².

Thus, it's not an eigenstate of H, but we can still compute the expectation value of H as <H> = (A/2)( <S_total²> - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(13/4 - 9/4) ħ² = (A/2)(4/4) ħ² = A/2 ħ².

But the given answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that the state is symmetric is incorrect in terms of the total spin. Wait, maybe the state is part of a triplet or something. Let me think.

Wait, if I have three spin 1/2 particles, the state psi is a symmetric state with two up and one down. In such a case, this is actually the state with total spin 1/2. Because for three spin 1/2 particles, the spin state with two up and one down can have total spin 1/2.

Wait, let me construct the possible states:

The triplet states (total spin 1/2) for three particles can be formed by combining singlet and triplet states of two particles with the third spin 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps another way.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation can be either spin 3/2 or spin 1/2, depending on their construction.

Wait, in this case, our state has two up spins and one down spin, and is symmetric. So, it can be part of the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, so maybe the state psi is in the spin 1/2 multiplet, meaning S_total = 1/2, so S_total² |psi> = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

But wait, earlier, we found that <S_total²> = 13/4 ħ². If |psi> is in the S_total = 1/2 multiplet, then <S_total²> should be 3/4 ħ², but we have 13/4 ħ², which is a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe my earlier calculation of <S_total²> is incorrect.

Wait, let's recast the problem.

Total spin squared is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding that, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, taking the expectation value in state psi:

<S_total²> = <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We know that <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = 3/4 ħ², so sum is 9/4 ħ².

Earlier, we found <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 1/2 ħ².

Thus, <S_total²> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(1/2 ħ²) = 9/4 + 1 = 13/4 ħ².

But for S_total = 1/2, <S_total²> should be (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

For S_total = 3/2, <S_total²> would be (3/2)(5/2) ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

Neither of these match 13/4. Therefore, |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total², which suggests that it is not an eigenstate of H.

But wait, the user says it is an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue 2/3 A ħ². So, something is wrong in my calculations. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps I should compute H acting on |psi> directly.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, let me compute each term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 on |psi>, and see if their sum is proportional to |psi>.

First, let me recall that S_i · S_j = (1/4)(P_ij - P_ij^T), where P_ij is the Pauli matrix for particle i and particle j.

Wait, for particles 1, 2, 3, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

Each S_i is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices for spin i.

So, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1 ⊗ σ2 + σ2 ⊗ σ1 ) / 2? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the product of Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's express S1·S2.

Each S1 is (ħ/2) σ1, and S2 is (ħ/2) σ2. So, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1 · σ2).

Similarly, σ1 · σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

And we know that σ1 · σ2 = 2 P_{12} - I, where P_{12} is the swap operator between particles 1 and 2.

So, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(2 P_{12} - I).

Similarly, S1·S3 = (ħ²/4)(2 P_{13} - I), and S2·S3 = (ħ²/4)(2 P_{23} - I).

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A ħ
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H, and if so, what its energy would be. The Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3 times a sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. 

First, let me recall that spin 1/2 particles have spin operators S_i which are vectors. For each particle, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. Since the particles are spin-1/2, the spin operator has eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

The state ψ is a symmetric combination of three states where two spins are up and one is down. Let me note that ψ is symmetric under permutation of particles 1, 2, and 3 because each term in the sum is obtained by flipping one up to down and permuting the particles. So ψ is symmetric, which might be useful when considering the commutators or expectations of the Hamiltonian.

Now, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Each term S_i·S_j is equal to (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to express the total spin squared operator.

Wait, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is equal to (1/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ). Let me check that:

Let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 gives ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2.

Therefore, H = A*( ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2 ).

Each S_i^2 for spin 1/2 particles is (3/4)ħ^2. So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

Thus, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 ).

So H = (A/2)( S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2 ). Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(9/4)ħ^2.

So to find the expectation value of H, or its eigenvalue, we need to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the state ψ.

What is S_total? S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The possible total spin states are either symmetric (triplet state) or antisymmetric (singlet state) with respect to permutation of particles.

Wait, our state ψ is symmetric. The triplet states are symmetric, and the singlet state is antisymmetric. So ψ must be part of the triplet state manifold.

In the triplet state, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is S(S+1)ħ^2. For triplet, S=1/2 * 3? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. When you have multiple particles, the total spin S can be in different multiplets. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2. Wait, is that right? Let me recall: for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). For three spin-1/2 particles, I think the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. So yes, triplet (S=3/2) and singlet (S=1/2).

Our state ψ is symmetric, so it's part of the triplet state with S=3/2. Then, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is S(S+1)ħ^2 = (3/2)(5/2)ħ^2 = (15/4)ħ^2.

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure. I might be confusing the cases. Let me consider: the total spin S for three particles can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are indeed 3/2 (which is symmetric) and 1/2 (which is antisymmetric with respect to permutation of the particles). So ψ is in the 3/2 multiplet.

Therefore, S_total^2 |ψ> = (15/4)ħ^2 |ψ>.

So, going back to H:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2 )

Thus, the expectation value of H is (A/2)( <S_total^2> - (9/4)ħ^2 )

Since <S_total^2> is (15/4)ħ^2,

Hence, <H> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) = (A/2)(6/4 ħ^2) = (A/2)(3/2 ħ^2) = (3/4)A ħ^2.

Wait, but the given answer is 2/3 A ħ^2. Hmm. So either I'm wrong or the given answer is wrong? Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check.

First, let me write down the Hamiltonian:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

We can rewrite this as H = A*( S1·(S2 + S3) + S2·S3 )

But maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, as I did before:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 )

So S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

Hence, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))

Which is correct.

Since each S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ^2, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2, as I said.

So H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 )

So if the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H has eigenvalue (A/2)(E_S - 9/4 ħ^2 ), where E_S is the eigenvalue of S_total^2.

For the given state ψ, which is symmetric, it's in the triplet state with S = 3/2.

Hence, S_total^2 |ψ> = ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ^2 |ψ> = (15/4) ħ^2 |ψ>

So plug into H:

H |ψ> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) |ψ> = (A/2)(6/4 ħ^2) |ψ> = (A/2)(3/2 ħ^2) |ψ> = (3/4)A ħ^2 |ψ>

Thus, the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ^2.

But the given answer is 2/3 A ħ^2. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the state ψ as part of the triplet.

Wait, let me analyze the state ψ.

ψ is given as 1/√3 ( up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3 )

Each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down.

So, in each term, the number of up spins is two, and the number of down spins is one.

Let me compute the total spin S_z of ψ.

In each term, the total spin-z is (1/2 - 1/2 + (-1/2)) = (-1/2) for up being +1/2, down being -1/2.

Wait, no: for each particle, up is +1/2 ħ, down is -1/2 ħ.

So for each term in ψ:

Term 1: up1 (1/2) + up2 (1/2) + down3 (-1/2) => total S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) ħ = (1/2) ħ

Similarly, Term 2: up1 + down2 ( -1/2 ) + up3 (1/2 ) => same, S_z = (1/2) ħ

Term3: down1 (-1/2) + up2 (1/2 ) + up3 (1/2 ) => same, S_z = (1 - 1 +1)/2 = 1/2 ħ

Wait, no: for Term3: -1/2 +1/2 +1/2 = ( -1 +1 +1 ) /2 = 1/2 ħ. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, each term is a product state: for example, Term1: up1, up2, down3.

So, the total spin-z is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2 ħ.

Similarly, each term has exactly one down, so S_z = (2*(1/2) + (-1/2)) = 1/2 ħ.

Therefore, each term in ψ has S_z = 1/2 ħ, and ψ is a symmetric combination of three such terms.

Thus, ψ is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue 1/2 ħ.

But we need to check whether ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not in the triplet manifold, but let's check.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's compute the expectation value of H directly.

Alternatively, note that the given state is symmetric under permutation, so it's in the triplet state, which has S = 3/2.

Wait, no, the triplet state for three spin-1/2 particles is S=3/2, but wait, hold on.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the triplet has S=1, but for three spin 1/2 particles, I think the maximum total spin is S= 3/2.

Wait, actually, let me recall that for n spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be from n/2 to n/2 in steps of 1 when n is even, but for n=3, which is odd, the possible total spins can be (3/2) and (1/2).

Wait, but is that correct? Because when you have three spin-1/2 particles, adding them two at a time, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. So yes, the maximum total spin is 3/2, and the minimum is 1/2.

So, our state ψ is symmetric, so it's in the S=3/2 multiplet.

Therefore, S_total^2 |ψ> = ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ^2 |ψ> = (15/4) ħ^2 |ψ>

Hence, H |ψ> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) |ψ> = (A/2)(6/4 ħ^2) |ψ> = (3/4)A ħ^2 |ψ>

So, the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ^2.

But in the given problem, the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ^2, as per the user.

Wait, so is my calculation incorrect?

Alternatively, maybe the state is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, but why?

Wait, perhaps I mischaracterized the state.

Wait, let me write down ψ:

ψ = 1/√3 ( |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ + |↑⟩ |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ )

Wait, is this state symmetric?

Wait, no, each term is a permutation where one particle is down and the others are up.

But in reality, each term is a product state where two are up, one is down, but the positions vary.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of ψ as a symmetric state under permutation.

Yes, because if you permute the particles, each term can be obtained from another.

Hence, yes, it is symmetric.

But wait, maybe we can also think of ψ as a singlet-like state but for three particles?

Wait, but in three particles, the singlet state is antisymmetric, so that's not the case.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the state is a combination of different total spin states.

Wait, but the state is symmetric, so must lie in the triplet.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation for H.

Let me compute H.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

We can write each S_i·S_j as (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Alternatively, perhaps a smarter way is to compute the expectation value <ψ| H |ψ>

Compute <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> and multiply by A.

Given that ψ is a symmetric state with two up and one down.

Compute each expectation value.

Let me note that for two spins, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( S_i^z S_j^z + (S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ) )

But perhaps it's easier to compute <S_i^z S_j^z>, <S_i^+ S_j^- >, etc.

But let me first compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each pair.

Let me note that in state ψ, the number of up spins is two, and the number of down spins is one.

Wait, but when we compute the expectation of S_i·S_j, we have to consider all possible combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for two spins in a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, but in our case, ψ is a three-spin state, so it's not just about two spins.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the expectation value <ψ| S_i · S_j |ψ> for each pair (i,j).

Let me denote <S_i · S_j> = <ψ| S_i^z S_j^z |ψ> + (1/2) <ψ| S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ |ψ>

But maybe it's better to compute each term separately.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S_i · S_j by using the identity that S_i · S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

So, for each pair, (i,j), we can compute each part.

But since the state ψ is symmetric with two up and one down, let's compute these expectation values.

First, compute <S_i^z S_j^z>:

For each term in ψ, each spin is either up or down.

Given that ψ is a symmetric state, the expectation value for each pair (i,j) will be the same. So <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = same value.

So let's compute <S1·S2>:

In the state ψ, each term has two ups and one down. For each term, the spins for particles 1 and 2 can be both up, or one up and one down, or both down. Wait, but in ψ, each term has exactly two ups and one down, so for particles 1 and 2, in each term, how many of them are up or down?

Looking at ψ: the first term is |↑↑↓>, so S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

Second term: |↑↓↑>, so S1^z=+1/2, S2^z=-1/2, S3^z=+1/2.

Third term: |↓↑↑>, so S1^z=-1/2, S2^z=+1/2, S3^z=+1/2.

Therefore, for each term, the z-components of spins for a given pair:

For pair (1,2):

First term: S1^z=+1/2, S2^z=+1/2 => product = +1/4.

Second term: S1^z=+1/2, S2^z=-1/2 => product = -1/4.

Third term: S1^z=-1/2, S2^z=+1/2 => product = -1/4.

So, summing over the three terms:

(+1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) = (-1/4) from second and third terms.

But each term in ψ is multiplied by 1/√3.

Thus, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/√3)(1/√3)[ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] = (1/3)[ -1/4 ] = -1/12.

But wait, wait: actually, for each term, the product S1^z S2^z is:

First term: (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4.

Second term: (+1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Third term: (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4.

So adding them up: 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Multiply by 1/3 (since each term is multiplied by 1/√3 and squared gives 1/3) to get the expectation value.

Hence, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12.

Similarly, for the other terms <S1^z S3^z> and <S2^z S3^z>, they will have the same expectation value.

Wait, let's compute <S1^z S3^z>:

First term: S1^z=+1/2, S3^z=-1/2 => product = -1/4.

Second term: S1^z=+1/2, S3^z=+1/2 => product = +1/4.

Third term: S1^z=-1/2, S3^z=+1/2 => product = -1/4.

So, sum: (-1/4) + (1/4) + (-1/4) = -1/4. Multiply by 1/3: -1/12.

Same for <S2^z S3^z>:

First term: S2^z=+1/2, S3^z=-1/2 => product = -1/4.

Second term: S2^z=-1/2, S3^z=+1/2 => product = -1/4.

Third term: S2^z=+1/2, S3^z=+1/2 => product = +1/4.

Sum: (-1/4) + (-1/4) +1/4 = -1/4. Multiply by 1/3: -1/12.

Therefore, each expectation value <S_i^z S_j^z> = -1/12.

Now, we need to compute the expectation value of the ladder terms, i.e., <S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+>.

Since the state ψ is symmetric and has two up spins and one down spin, let's see what <S_i^+ S_j^- > is.

First, let's recall that S_i^+ S_j^- is the raising operator for i and lowering operator for j.

So, for each pair (i,j), what is the expectation value of S_i^+ S_j^-?

Again, because of symmetry, <S1^+ S2^- > = <S1^+ S3^- > = <S2^+ S3^- >. So let's compute one of them.

Compute <ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ>.

First, express ψ as a vector, or perhaps compute the matrix elements.

Wait, this might get complicated, but perhaps we can find the expectation value by considering the action of S1^+ S2^- on each term in ψ.

Given that, let me think about how S1^+ and S2^- act on the state.

The state ψ is a symmetric combination of three terms with two ups and one down.

So, let's consider the term |↑↑↓>:

S1^+ |↑↑↓> = S1^+ |↑_1 ↑_2 ↓_3> = 0, because S1^+ |↑> = 0.

S2^- |↑↑↓> = S2^- |↑_2> = 0 because S2^+ |↑> = 0.

Wait, no: S2^- acts on the spin of particle 2. So, S2^- |↑↑↓> = |↑↓〉, because S2^- acting on |↑> gives |↓>.

Similarly, S1^+ |↑↑↓> = 0.

Thus, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓> = 0.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>:

S1^+ |↑↓↑> = 0.

S2^- |↓> = |↑>, so S2^- |↑↓↑> = |↑↑〉.

Hence, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = 0 * |↑↑〉 = 0.

Wait, no: S1^+ acting on |↑> is 0, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = 0.

Wait, let's do it properly.

Compute S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑>:

First, S2^- |↑↓↑> = |↑↑〉.

Then, S1^+ |↑↑〉 = 0, because S1^+ |↑〉 = 0.

Hence, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = 0.

Similarly, for |↓↑↑>:

S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑> = S1^+ |↑↑〉.

But S1^+ |↑〉 = 0, so S1^+ |↑↑〉 = 0. Therefore, S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑> = 0.

Wait, so S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, because acting on each term in ψ gives zero.

Similarly, for S2^+ S1^-, same thing?

Wait, actually, S1^+ S2^- and S2^+ S1^- are different, but when acting on symmetric states, perhaps they have similar effects.

Wait, let me compute S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓>:

S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓>:

First, S1^- |↑> = 0, so S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓> = 0.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>:

S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑> = S2^+ |↓〉 = |↑⟩, and S1^- |↑〉 = |↓〉.

Thus, S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑> = |↑⟩ |↓〉 / something?

Wait, no, S1^- |↑〉 = |↓〉, so S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑> = S2^+ |↓〉 = |↑〉.

Wait, so S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑> = |↑↑〉.

Similarly, for |↓↑↑>:

S2^+ S1^- |↓↑↑> = S2^+ |↑〉 = |↓〉, and S1^- |↑〉 = |↓〉.

So, S2^+ S1^- |↓↑↑> = S2^+ |↑〉 |↑〉 = |↓〉 |↑〉.

But S2^+ |↑〉 = |↓〉, so S2^+ S1^- |↓↑↑> = |↓〉 |↑〉.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, note that the state ψ is a combination of three states with two ups and one down.

When we apply S1^+ S2^-, which lowers spin 2 and raises spin 1.

But in ψ, each term already has two ups and one down. So, for a term like |↑↑↓>, S1^+ S2^- would lower spin 2 and raise spin 1.

But spin 2 is up, so lowering it would bring it down to down, and raising spin 1 (already up) would do nothing. So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓> = S1^+ |↑↓〉 = 0.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>, S1^+ S2^- would lower spin 2 to up, and raise spin 1 (already up) to nothing. So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑↑〉 = 0.

Similarly for |↓↑↑>, S1^+ S2^- would lower spin 2 to down, and raise spin 1 (down) to nothing. So S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑> = 0.

Hence, S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0.

Similarly, S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = 0.

Because similar reasoning applies: when trying to lower spin 1 and raise spin 2, but all terms have two ups, so when you try to raise spin 2 from down, you'd have to have spin 2 down, but in ψ, the only down is in different positions, so in each term, only one spin is down, which would not allow the raising to happen.

Wait, perhaps not entirely. For example, in the term |↑↓↑>, spin 2 is down, so S2^+ |↓〉 = |↑〉, and S1^- |↑〉 = |↓〉. So S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑> = |↑〉 |↑〉.

But then, in ψ, the coefficient for |↑↑↑> is zero, so the overlap might be non-zero?

Wait, let me write ψ explicitly.

ψ = 1/√3 ( |↑↑↓〉 + |↑↓↑〉 + |↓↑↑〉 )

Now, compute S2^+ S1^- ψ.

First, S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓〉:

S2^+ |↑↓〉 = |↑↑〉, and S1^- |↑↑〉 = |↓〉 |↑〉.

Wait, no: S1^- acting on |↑↑〉 is |↓〉 |↑〉.

Wait, no, let's do it step by step.

First, S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓〉:

Apply S1^- first: S1^- |↑↑↓〉 = |↓↑↓〉.

Then apply S2^+ to |↓↑↓〉:

S2^+ |↓〉 = |↑〉, so S2^+ |↓↑↓〉 = |↑↑↓〉.

Thus, S2^+ S1^- |↑↑↓〉 = |↑↑↓〉.

Similarly, S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑〉:

First, S1^- |↑↓↑〉 = |↓↓↑〉.

Then, S2^+ |↓〉 = |↑〉, so S2^+ |↓↓↑〉 = |↑↓↑〉.

So, S2^+ S1^- |↑↓↑〉 = |↑↓↑〉.

Similarly, S2^+ S1^- |↓↑↑〉:

First, S1^- |↓↑↑〉 = |↑↑↑〉.

Then, S2^+ |↑〉 = |↓〉, so S2^+ |↑↑↑〉 = |↓↑↑〉.

Thus, S2^+ S1^- |↓↑↑〉 = |↓↑↑〉.

Therefore, S2^+ S1^- ψ = 1/√3 ( |↑↑↓〉 + |↑↓↑〉 + |↓↑↑〉 ) = ψ.

Wait, that is, S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = ψ.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, as computed earlier.

Wait, but no, S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, but S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = ψ.

Wait, that seems inconsistent unless the operators are different.

Wait, but actually, S_i^+ S_j^- ≠ S_j^+ S_i^-. They are different operators.

So, in our case, S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, but S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = ψ.

So, what is the expectation value of S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ?

For pair (1,2), compute <ψ | S1^+ S2^- + S2^+ S1^- | ψ>

From above, S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, so <ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ> = 0.

S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = ψ, so <ψ | S2^+ S1^- | ψ> = <ψ | ψ> = 1.

Therefore, <S1^+ S2^- + S2^+ S1^- > = 0 + 1 = 1.

But wait, that can't be right because the operator S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ is related to the spin singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ acting on it gives a negative value? Let me recall.

Wait, for two spins, the singlet state is |singlet> = 1/√2 ( |↑↓〉 - |↓↑〉 ).

Compute <singlet| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |singlet>

S1^+ S2^- |singlet> = S1^+ |↓〉 - S1^+ |↑〉 ) / √2.

Wait, S1^+ |↓〉 = |↑〉, S1^+ |↑〉 = 0.

So S1^+ S2^- |singlet> = |↑〉 - 0 ) / √2 = |↑↑〉 / √2.

Similarly, S2^+ S1^- |singlet> = |↓↑〉 / √2.

Thus, <singlet| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |singlet> = <singlet| (|↑↑〉 + |↓↑〉 ) / √2.

But <singlet|↑↑> = 0, <singlet|↓↑> = -1/√2.

Therefore, (0 + (-1/√2 )) / √2 = -1/2.

Similarly, the expectation value for the singlet state is -1/2.

For the triplet states, which are |↑↑〉, |↑↓〉, |↓↑〉, etc., the expectation value of S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ is positive.

Indeed, for the triplet state |↑↑〉:

S1^+ S2^- |↑↑〉 = S1^+ |↑〉 = 0.

S2^+ S1^- |↑↑〉 = 0.

Hence, <triplet| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |triplet> = 0.

Wait, but that contradicts earlier.

Wait, actually no. Wait, for the triplet state, each term is a product state where both spins are up.

So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑〉 = S1^+ |↑〉 = 0.

Similarly, S2^+ S1^- |↑↑〉 = 0.

Hence, the expectation value is 0.

Wait, perhaps the operator S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ has expectation value 0 for triplet states and -1 for singlet states?

Wait, let me check for the triplet state |↑↑〉:

Compute <↑↑| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |↑↑〉.

As above, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑〉 = 0, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑〉 = 0.

Thus, <↑↑| (0 + 0 ) = 0.

Similarly, for |↑↓〉:

S1^+ S2^- |↑↓〉 = 0.

S1^- S2^+ |↑↓〉 = S1^- |↑〉 |↑〉 = |↓〉 |↑〉.

Thus, <↑↓| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |↑↓〉 = <↑↓| 0 + |↓↑〉 > = <↑↓|↓↑> = 0.

Because |↑↓〉 and |↓↑〉 are orthogonal.

Hence, for triplet states, the expectation value is 0.

For the singlet state, it's -1/2.

So, in our case, for the three-spin state ψ, when we compute S1^+ S2^- + S2^+ S1^-, we have S1^+ S2^- |ψ> = 0, and S2^+ S1^- |ψ> = |ψ>, so <ψ | S1^+ S2^- + S2^+ S1^- | ψ> = 0 + 1 = 1.

But according to the two-spin case, the singlet has expectation value -1/2, and the triplet has 0.

But here, in three-spin state, the expectation value is 1? That seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps not. Because in two-spin case, the operator S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ is a specific operator, but in three-spin case, it's a different operator.

Wait, actually, S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ is a number operator for two spins, but in the three-spin case, it's a tensor operator.

But in our specific case, when we compute <ψ | S1^+ S2^- + S2^+ S1^- | ψ>, we get 1. So, the expectation value is 1.

But wait, in two-spin case, for a single pair, the expectation value is 0 for triplet and -1/2 for singlet.

But in three-spin case
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I've got this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and S1, S2, S3 are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt{3} times the sum of products of up and down spins in a specific way: up1*up2*down3, up1*down2*up3, and down1*up2*up3.

The question is whether this state psi is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what the energy is, or if not, what the expectation value of the energy is. The correct answer provided is that psi is an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*hbar².

Okay, let me start breaking this down. First, I need to understand what the state psi looks like. It's a symmetric state? Let me check: Each term is a product of two up spins and one down spin. But looking at the permutations, each particle is down once and up twice. So, each term is a different permutation where each particle is down once, up the other two. So, the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles. That's an important point.

Since all the terms are similar, with each particle taking the down position once, the state is symmetric. Now, the Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of spin operators. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since each term is S_i·S_j, which involves the sum of products like S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z, so H is a sum of such terms for all pairs.

Now, to check if psi is an eigenstate of H, we can compute H|psi> and see if it's a scalar multiple of |psi>. If H|psi> = E|psi>, then psi is an eigenstate with energy E. So, let's see.

But maybe there's a smarter way. The total spin operator is S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, and the square of total spin is S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2H. Therefore, H = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Given that each spin is 1/2, S1² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, H = [S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²]/2 = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

So, H = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Therefore, if I can compute H acting on psi, it's equivalent to computing (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 acting on psi. So, perhaps it's easier to compute S_total² |psi> first.

So, let's compute S_total² |psi>. S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Hmm, but since H is a combination of S_i·S_j, perhaps it's better to relate S_total² to H.

Wait, from earlier, H = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2, so S_total² = 2H + 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, S_total² |psi> = 2H |psi> + (9/4)ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, if we compute S_total² |psi>, we can relate it back to H|psi>.

So, let me try to compute S_total² |psi>. Since S_total² is the sum of S_i² and twice the sum of S_i·S_j.

But maybe a better approach is to note that if the state |psi> has a certain total spin, then S_total² |psi> would be ħ² times the square of the total spin. So, perhaps if I can determine the total spin S_total for the state |psi>, I can find S_total² |psi>.

Total spin for a state with three spin 1/2 particles can be 1, 0, or 1/2, depending on how they combine. Since all three particles are spin 1/2, and we have a symmetric state, maybe it's a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, the state |psi> is symmetric under permutation of particles. Let's see: each term is a permutation where each particle is down once and up twice. So, it's a symmetric combination, but actually, each term is a basis state with two up spins and one down.

Wait, actually, if I think about combining three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2, 1/2. Let me recall that.

But when you have three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 (the triplet states) and 1/2 (the singlet state). But wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the maximum total spin is 3/2, and the possible total spins are 0, 1, 2? Wait, no, actually, spin is added two at a time. Let's think step by step.

Start with two spin 1/2 particles: they can combine to spin 1 (triplet) or spin 0 (singlet). Then, adding a third spin 1/2 particle to each of these possibilities.

So, for the spin 1 (triplet) state, adding spin 1 and spin 1/2: possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

For the spin 0 (singlet) state, adding spin 1/2: possible total spins are 1/2.

Therefore, overall, the three spin 1/2 particles can form total spin states with S = 3/2, 1/2, and another 1/2.

But in our case, the state |psi> is symmetric. Let me see if it's part of the triplet (S=3/2) or the singlet (S=1/2) or something else.

Wait, each term in |psi> has two up spins and one down spin. So, the state is symmetric under permutation, but perhaps it's a combination of the triplet and singlet states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_total², which is <S_total²> = <psi|S_total²|psi>, which would be <psi|(2H + 9/4 ħ²)|psi> = <psi|2H|psi> + (9/4)ħ² <psi|psi>.

But since |psi> is normalized, the second term is (9/4)ħ². So, <S_total²> = 2<A> + (9/4)ħ², where <A> is <psi|H|psi>.

So, if I can compute <S_total²>, I can then solve for <H>.

Alternatively, if I can determine the eigenvalue of S_total² for |psi>, then I can plug it into the equation to find <H>.

So, if S_total² |psi> = S(S+1) ħ² |psi>, then <S_total²> = S(S+1) ħ².

So, which S do we have?

Looking at the state |psi>: it's symmetric, and each particle is down once. Let me think about the total spin.

Each term in |psi> has two up spins and one down spin. Let's compute the total z-component of spin, S_z.

Each up spin contributes ħ/2, and each down contributes -ħ/2. So, in each term:

- up1 up2 down3: S_z = (ħ/2) + (ħ/2) + (-ħ/2) = ħ/2
- Similarly, each term is the same: each term has S_z = ħ/2.

Therefore, the state |psi> is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2.

But S_total² commutes with S_z, so if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_z, then S_total² |psi> is also an eigenstate of S_z, but it may not necessarily be an eigenstate of S_total² unless S_total² shares the same eigenstates as S_z.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps |psi> has a definite S² as well.

Wait, let's compute S²_total for |psi>:

The total spin squared is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Maybe expanding it:

S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already know S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ² each, so their sum is 9/4 ħ².

Then, the other term is 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is 2H. Therefore, S_total² = 2H + 9/4 ħ².

So, for any state |psi>, we have S_total² |psi> = (2H |psi> + 9/4 ħ² |psi>) = 9/4 ħ² |psi> + 2H |psi>.

Therefore, S_total² |psi> = 9/4 ħ² |psi> + 2H |psi>.

So, if I can compute S_total² |psi>, then I can write S_total² |psi> = [9/4 ħ² + 2H] |psi>, so rearranged, H |psi> = [S_total² |psi> - 9/4 ħ² |psi> ] / 2.

Therefore, if I can find S_total² |psi>, then I can find H |psi>.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute <psi|S_total² |psi> and relate it to <H>.

But perhaps I can compute the eigenvalue of S_total² by looking at the state.

Since |psi> is symmetric, and we found that it's an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. To find the eigenvalue of S_total², we need to know the total spin S.

We can try to find the possible S values.

Let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are:

- S = 3/2: which corresponds to triplet states, symmetric, with m_s = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Wait, no, wait: when combining three spin 1/2 particles, the maximum total spin is 3/2, and the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

For S = 3/2, the state is symmetric and has m_s = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

For S = 1/2, the state is antisymmetric under exchange? Wait, no, actually, I need to think about how the states combine.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the state |psi> has two up spins and one down spin. Let's see if it's a part of the triplet (S=3/2) state.

The triplet state with S=3/2 has m_s = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. Each of these can be represented as symmetric states.

Our state |psi> has m_s = ħ/2, which is 1/2 ħ. So, that's m_s = 1/2. So, |psi> is the m=1/2 state of the triplet with S=3/2.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, in the triplet state for three spin 1/2 particles, the state with m_s = 3/2 is all three spins up.

For m_s = 1/2, it's a symmetric state where one spin is down and the other two are up. So, yes, our |psi> is the m=1/2 state of the triplet with S=3/2.

So, that would mean that |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S(S+1) ħ² = (3/2)(5/2) ħ² = (15/4) ħ².

Therefore, S_total² |psi> = (15/4) ħ² |psi>.

So, going back, S_total² |psi> = 9/4 ħ² |psi> + 2H |psi>

Therefore, (15/4) ħ² |psi> = 9/4 ħ² |psi> + 2H |psi>

Subtracting 9/4 ħ² |psi> from both sides:

(15/4 - 9/4) ħ² |psi> = 2H |psi>

(6/4) ħ² |psi> = 2H |psi>

Simplify 6/4 to 3/2:

(3/2) ħ² |psi> = 2H |psi>

Therefore, H |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>

So, the energy eigenvalue is (3/4) ħ², but wait, the correct answer is given as 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, hold on, there's an A factor in H, right? H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). So, H |psi> = A*(sum S_i·S_j) |psi>.

But in my calculation above, I have H |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>, but that must be in units where A=1.

Wait, let me double-check. Because H is H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). So, S_total² = sum S_i² + 2 sum S_i·S_j. So, sum S_i·S_j = (S_total² - sum S_i²)/2. Therefore, H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) = A*(S_total² - sum S_i²)/2.

Given that sum S_i² = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ². So, sum S_i·S_j = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2. Therefore, H = A*(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

So, earlier, I considered H as (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2, but it's actually H = A*(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Therefore, H |psi> = A*(S_total² |psi> - 9/4 ħ² |psi>)/2.

But since S_total² |psi> = 15/4 ħ² |psi>, as we found above, the equation becomes:

H |psi> = A*(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = A*(6/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = A*(3/2 ħ²)/2 |psi> = A*(3/4 ħ²) |psi>.

So, H |psi> = (3/4 A ħ²) |psi>. So, the eigenvalue is (3/4 A) ħ².

Wait, but the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in determining S_total² |psi>.

Wait, let me go back. So, I assumed that |psi> is the m=1/2 state of the triplet with S=3/2. Therefore, S_total² |psi> = S(S+1) ħ² |psi> = (3/2)(5/2) ħ² |psi> = 15/4 ħ² |psi>.

But let me compute S_total² |psi> manually to verify.

Compute S_total² |psi> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi> = (S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) |psi>.

We know S1² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi> for each particle, so sum S1² + S2² + S3² = (9/4) ħ² |psi>.

So, the first term is 9/4 ħ² |psi>.

Now, the second term is 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi>.

But H = A*(sum S_i·S_j), so (sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = (H/A) |psi>.

Therefore, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = 2*(H/A) |psi>.

But wait, from my earlier equation, H |psi> = (3/4 A ħ²) |psi>, so (sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = (H/A) |psi> = (3/4 ħ²) |psi>.

Therefore, 2*(sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = (3/2 ħ²) |psi>.

So, putting it together:

S_total² |psi> = 9/4 ħ² |psi> + 3/2 ħ² |psi> = (9/4 + 6/4) ħ² |psi> = (15/4) ħ² |psi>.

Which is consistent with my earlier result.

Thus, H |psi> = (3/4 A ħ²) |psi>, so the eigenvalue is (3/4 A) ħ². But the correct answer is (2/3 A ħ²). Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the total spin. Let's think again about the state |psi>.

Each term in |psi> has two up spins and one down spin, so the state is symmetric and has m_s = 1/2 ħ, as each term has S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) ħ = (1/2) ħ.

But in the triplet state with S=3/2, the m_s values go from 3/2 to -3/2 in steps of 1, but wait, no, for spin S, m_s can take 2S + 1 values from -S to +S in steps of 1. So, for S=3/2, m_s can be 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Therefore, the state |psi> is the m=1/2 state of the triplet with S=3/2. So, S_total² |psi> = (3/2)(5/2) ħ² |psi> = 15/4 ħ² |psi>.

But H is given as A*(sum S_i·S_j). So, from S_total² = sum S_i² + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

Therefore, sum S_i·S_j = (S_total² - sum S_i²)/2.

Thus, sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (S_total² |psi> - sum S_i² |psi>)/2 = (15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = (6/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = (3/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = 3/8 ħ² |psi>.

Wait, no, wait:

sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (S_total² |psi> - sum S_i² |psi>) / 2.

Which would be (15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = (6/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = (3/4 ħ²)/2 |psi> = 3/8 ħ² |psi>.

Wait, that's different from before. But earlier, I thought that sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (3/4 A) |psi> because of H |psi> = A sum S_i·S_j |psi> = A*(3/4 A) |psi>?

Wait, no, no, H = A sum S_i·S_j, so sum S_i·S_j = H / A. Therefore, sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (H / A) |psi>.

But from the calculation:

sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (S_total² |psi> - sum S_i² |psi>)/2 = (15/4 - 9/4)/2 ħ² |psi> = (6/4)/2 ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, sum S_i·S_j |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

Thus, H |psi> = A*(sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = A*(3/4 ħ²) |psi>.

So, the energy eigenvalue is (3/4 A ħ²).

But the correct answer is given as (2/3 A ħ²). So, what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I messed up the identification of |psi> as the m=1/2 state of S=3/2.

Wait, in three spin 1/2 particles, the m=1/2 state of the triplet can also be achieved by different combinations. Perhaps |psi> is not in the S=3/2 triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the state |psi> is not a state of total spin S=3/2 but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing S_total² |psi>.

Wait, let me compute S_total² more carefully. So, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

If I can expand this operator and apply it to |psi>, maybe I can find its action.

But that seems tedious, but let's try.

First, note that S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already accounted for S1² + S2² + S3² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, let's compute the action of S1·S2 on |psi>:

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute S1·S2 |psi>:

= S1^x S2^x |psi> + S1^y S2^y |psi> + S1^z S2^z |psi>.

Compute each term:

Compute S1^z S2^z |psi>:

S1^z |up1> = (ħ/2) |up1>, S2^z |up2> = (ħ/2) |up2>.

So, S1^z S2^z |psi> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |up1 up2 down3> + similar terms.

Similarly, for the other terms, let's compute.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: let's compute S1·S2 |psi>.

Note that |psi> is a symmetric combination of states with two up and one down.

Each term in |psi> has two up spins and one down spin, with each particle down once.

So, for S1·S2 |psi>, we can think about how each term in |psi> is affected.

Let me write |psi> as:

|psi> = 1/sqrt{3} [ |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ]

So, each term is a permutation where each particle is down once.

So, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓>:

First, S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Compute each component:

S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (S1^z |↑>) (S2^z |↑>) = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓>.

S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓>:

S1^x |↑> = (1/2) (|↓> + |↑>) ? Wait, no, spin-x operator is (|↑><↓| + |↓><↑|)/2, but when acting on |↑>, it gives (|↓> + |↑>)/2. Wait, no, actually, Sx = (ħ/2)(|↑><↓| + |↓><↑|). So, Sx |↑> = (ħ/2)|↓> + (ħ/2)|↑>?

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, Sx is (ħ/2)( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ). So, Sx |↑> = (ħ/2) |↓> and Sx |↓> = -(ħ/2)|↑>.

Yes, correct. So, Sx |↑> = (ħ/2)|↓>, Sx |↓> = -(ħ/2)|↑>.

Therefore, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> = (S1^x |↑>) ⊗ (S2^x |↑>) = (ħ/2 |↓>) ⊗ (ħ/2 |↓>) = (ħ²/4)|↓↓↑>.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓>:

Sy |↑> = (iħ/2)|↓> - (ħ/2)|↑>.

So, Sy |↑> = - (ħ/2)|↑> + i (ħ/2)|↓>.

Similarly, Sy |↑> = -(ħ/2)|↑> + i (ħ/2)|↓>.

Therefore, Sy |↑> = ħ/2 (-|↑> + i |↓> ).

So, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> = (Sy |↑>) ⊗ (Sy |↑>) = (ħ/2)^2 [ (-|↑> + i |↓> ) (-|↑> + i |↓> ) ].

Compute the product:

(-|↑> + i |↓>)(-|↑> + i |↓>) = |↑>² - i |↑> |↓> - i |↑> |↓> + i² |↓>².

= |↑>² - 2i |↑> |↓> - |↓>².

Therefore, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4) [ |↑>² - 2i |↑> |↓> - |↓>² ].

But |↑>² is |↑↑↓>, and |↓>² is |↓↓↑>, and |↑> |↓> is |↑↓↑>.

So, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4)[ |↑↑↓> - 2i |↑↓↑> - |↓↓↑> ].

Similarly, S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> + S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> + S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓>

= (ħ²/4)|↓↓↑> + (ħ²/4)( |↑↑↓> - 2i |↑↓↑> - |↓↓↑> )

= (ħ²/4)( |↑↑↓> ) + (ħ²/4)(|↓↓↑> - |↓↓↑> ) + (ħ²/4)( -2i |↑↓↑> )

= (ħ²/4)( |↑↑↓> ) + 0 + (-i ħ²/2) |↑↓↑>.

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓> - (i ħ²/2)|↑↓↑>.

Similarly, compute S1·S2 for the other terms in |psi>.

Next, compute S1·S2 |↑↓↑>.

Similarly, S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↑↓↑>.

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) |↑↓↑> = (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑>.

S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑>:

S1^x |↑> = ħ/2 |↓>, S2^x |↓> = ħ/2 |↑>.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑> = (ħ/2 |↓>) ⊗ (ħ/2 |↑>) = (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑>.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑>:

S1^y |↑> = -ħ/2 |↑> + i ħ/2 |↓>, S2^y |↓> = -ħ/2 |↓> - i ħ/2 |↑>.

So, S1^y |↑> = -ħ/2 |↑> + i ħ/2 |↓>, S2^y |↓> = -ħ/2 |↓> - i ħ/2 |↑>.

Multiplying these, we get:

(-ħ/2 |↑> + i ħ/2 |↓>) ⊗ (-ħ/2 |↓> - i ħ/2 |↑> )

= (ħ²/4)[ |↑> |↓> + i |↑> |↑> - i |↓> |↓> - i^2 |↓> |↑> ]

= (ħ²/4)[ |↑↓> + i |↑↑> - i |↓↓> + |↓↑> ].

So, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑> = (ħ²/4)( |↑↓> + |↓↑> + i |↑↑> - i |↓↓> ).

Therefore, putting it all together:

S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑> + S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑> + S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑>

= (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑> + (ħ²/4)( |↑↓> + |↓↑> + i |↑↑> - i |↓↓> ) + (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑>.

Combine terms:

= [ (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑> - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑> ] + (ħ²/4)( |↑↓> + |↓↑> ) + (ħ²/4)( i |↑↑> - i |↓↓> ).

Similarly, compute S1·S2 |↓↑↑>:

S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↓↑↑>.

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|↓↑↑> = (-ħ²/4)|↓↑↑>.

S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑>:

S1^x |↓> = -ħ/2 |↑>, S2^x |↑> = ħ/2 |↓>.

Thus, S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> = (-ħ/2 |↑>) ⊗ (ħ/2 |↓>) = (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑>.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑>:

S1^y |↓> = -ħ/2 |↓> - i ħ/2 |↑>, S2^y |↑> = -ħ/2 |↑> - i ħ/2 |↓>.

Multiply these:

(-ħ/2 |↓> - i ħ/2 |↑>) ⊗ (-ħ/2 |↑> - i ħ/2 |↓> )

= (ħ²/4)[ |↓> |↑> + i |↓> |↓> + i |↑> |↑> - i^2 |↑> |↓> ]

= (ħ²/4)[ |↓↑> + i |↓↓> + i |↑↑> + |↑↓> ].

So, S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> = (ħ²/4)( |↓↑> + |↑↓> + i |↑↑> + i |↓↓> ).

Putting it all together:

S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> + S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> + S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑>

= (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑> + (ħ²/4)( |↓↑> + |↑↓> + i |↑↑> + i |↓↓> ) + (-ħ²/4)|↓↑↑>.

Combine terms:

= [ (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑> - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑> ] + (ħ²/4)( |↓↑> + |↑↓> ) + (ħ²/4)( i |↑↑> + i |↓↓> ).

Now, we have computed S1·S2 acting on each term in |psi>:

- S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = (ħ²/4)|↑↑↓> - (i ħ²/2)|↑↓↑>.

- S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = [ (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑> - (ħ²/4)|↑↓↑> ] + (ħ²/4)( |↑↓> + |↓↑> ) + (ħ²/4)( i |↑↑> - i |↓↓> ).

- S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = [ (-ħ²/4)|↑↓↑> - (ħ²/4)|↓↑↑> ] + (ħ²/4)( |↓↑> + |↑↓> ) + (ħ²/4)( i |↑↑> + i |↓↓> ).

Now, let's compute the sum S1·S2 |psi>:

|psi> = 1/sqrt{3} ( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> )

Thus, S1·S2 |psi> = 1/sqrt{3} [ S1·S2 |↑↑↓> + S1·S2 |↑↓↑> + S1·S2 |↓↑↑> ]

So, compute each component:

First, S1·S2 |↑↑↓> contributes:

(ħ²/4)|↑↑↓> - (i
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall what I know about spin-1/2 particles and their operators. Each spin operator Si has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. For spin-1/2 particles, these are given by:

S_i^x = (ħ/2) * σ_x,
S_i^y = (ħ/2) * σ_y,
S_i^z = (ħ/2) * σ_z,

where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

The Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of the spin operators:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Since H is a sum of dot products, it's similar to the exchange interaction energy in antiferromagnetic materials. I remember that the dot product of two spin operators can be expressed in terms of their total spin squared.

Specifically, for two spin operators S_i and S_j, we have:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2),

where S_{i+j} is the total spin of particles i and j combined.

So, applying this identity to each term in H:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2),

S1·S3 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S3^2 - S_{13}^2),

S2·S3 = (1/2)(S2^2 + S3^2 - S_{23}^2).

Therefore, H can be rewritten as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)
   = A*( (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2) + (1/2)(S1^2 + S3^2 - S_{13}^2) + (1/2)(S2^2 + S3^2 - S_{23}^2) )

Let me compute each part:

First, note that S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are each (ħ^2/4)*I for spin-1/2 particles, since S^2 = (s(s+1))ħ^2 = (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2 for spin 1/2.

So S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ^2 I.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (3/4 ħ^2 I) + (3/4 ħ^2 I) - S_{12}^2 )
             = (1/2)( (3/2 ħ^2 I) - S_{12}^2 )
             = (3/4 ħ^2 I - (1/2) S_{12}^2 )

Similarly for the other terms.

So putting it all together:

H = A*( [ (3/4 ħ^2 I - (1/2) S_{12}^2 ) + (3/4 ħ^2 I - (1/2) S_{13}^2 ) + (3/4 ħ^2 I - (1/2) S_{23}^2 ) ] )

Combine the terms:

Number of (3/4 ħ^2 I) terms: 3 terms, so 3*(3/4 ħ^2 I) = (9/4 ħ^2 I)

Number of (-1/2 S_{ij}^2) terms: 3 terms, so - (1/2)(S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 )

Thus, H = A*(9/4 ħ^2 I - (1/2)(S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2))

But S_{12}^2 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2, so S_{12}^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. But we already have that S1·S2 is part of our original expression, so perhaps this isn't the most straightforward path.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express H in terms of the total spin squared of the entire system.

Let me think. The total spin squared is S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Plugging this into H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 )

We already know that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2 I, so:

H = A*( (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4 ħ^2 I))/2 ) = A*( (S_total^2 - (9/4 ħ^2 I))/2 )

So H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

Therefore, H can be written as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

Now, if I can find the eigenvalues of S_total^2, that would help. Since S_total^2 is the total spin squared, its eigenvalues are s(s+1) ħ^2 where s is the total spin.

So the eigenvalues of H would be:

E = (A/2)(s(s+1) ħ^2) - (9 A)/8 ħ^2

But the state psi is given as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

I need to determine the total spin s of this state. To find the spin multiplicity, perhaps I can compute the total spin squared operator on this state.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the singlet and triplet states and see how this state is composed.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1/2 or 3/2, corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric states. But wait, no, actually, the total spin s of three spin-1/2 particles can be s = 1/2 or 3/2.

But wait, no, that's not entirely correct. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can actually be 0, 1, or 2? Wait, no, let's think about it.

Each spin is 1/2, so adding two gives either spin 1 or spin 0. Then, adding a third spin.

So, adding spin 1 (from two particles) and spin 1/2 (third particle): possible total spins are |1 - 1/2| = 1/2 and 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.

Similarly, adding spin 0 and spin 1/2: only spin 1/2.

So, for three spin-1/2 particles, possible total spins are 1/2 and 3/2. So s can be 1/2 or 3/2.

But the state psi is symmetric under permutation of particles? Let's check. Let me write down the state:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Each term has exactly two up spins and one down. Let me swap particles 1 and 2. Applying permutation to the first two particles:

|↑↑↓⟩ → |↑↑↓⟩ (since particles 1 and 2 both have up spins, swapping doesn't change it)
|↑↓↑⟩ → |↓↑↑⟩ (swapping particles 1 and 2 in |↑↓↑⟩ gives |↓↑↑⟩)
|↓↑↑⟩ → |↑↓↑⟩ (swapping particles 1 and 2 in |↓↑↑⟩ gives |↑↓↑⟩)

So psi becomes:

(1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ )

Which is the same as the original psi. So psi is symmetric under permutation of particles 1 and 2.

Similarly, if we swap any two particles, the state remains the same because each term has two ups and one down, so swapping any two particles will just permute the terms, but since there are three terms, it remains symmetric.

Therefore, psi is symmetric under permutation of any two particles, which suggests that it's in the symmetric subspace, which corresponds to total spin s = 3/2.

Wait, but is that necessarily the case? Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states have total spin s = 3/2, and the antisymmetric states have s = 1/2. So yes, since psi is symmetric, it's in the s = 3/2 subspace.

Therefore, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is s(s+1) ħ^2 = (3/2)(5/2) ħ^2 = (15/4) ħ^2.

So, going back to H:

H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

Thus, the eigenvalue of H on psi is:

E = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) - (9 A)/8 ħ^2

Calculate this:

First term: (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) = (15 A ħ^2)/8

Second term: (9 A)/8 ħ^2

So E = (15 A ħ^2)/8 - (9 A ħ^2)/8 = (6 A ħ^2)/8 = (3 A ħ^2)/4

Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ^2? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check.

Earlier, I said that H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

But let's compute H as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Which, using the identity, becomes:

H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 )

Since S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4 ħ^2 I) = (9/4) ħ^2 I

So,

H = A*( (S_total^2 - (9/4 ħ^2 I )) / 2 )
   = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

So that seems correct.

Then, since psi is in the s=3/2 subspace, S_total^2 |psi> = (15/4 ħ^2) |psi>

Therefore, H |psi> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) |psi> - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 |psi>

Compute:

(15 A ħ^2)/8 |psi> - (9 A ħ^2)/8 |psi>
= (6 A ħ^2 / 8) |psi>
= (3 A ħ^2 /4) |psi>

So the eigenvalue is 3 A ħ^2 /4, not 2/3 A ħ^2 as stated.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 15/4 divided by 2 is 15/8. Then 15/8 A ħ^2 minus 9/8 A ħ^2 is (6/8) A ħ^2, which is 3/4 A ħ^2.

Hmm, so either my initial calculation is wrong, or the correct answer is different.

Wait, let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is a singlet state or something else.

Wait, let's compute the total spin of the state psi.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. So the total spin S_z for each term is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ.

So each term has S_z = +1/2 ħ.

But when combining, the total spin state is a combination of these. Since each term is a product state with two ups and one down, I can express each term in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute S_total^2 for this state.

Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi and see what it is.

Alternatively, I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

But given that the state is symmetric under permutation, it's in the s=3/2 subspace, so S_total^2 has eigenvalue (15/4)ħ^2.

Wait, but maybe not. Because for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 1/2 and 3/2. The symmetric states under permutations of the particles have total spin 3/2, and the antisymmetric states have total spin 1/2.

Wait, so psi is symmetric, so it's in the symmetric space, so the total spin is 3/2.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (15/4)ħ^2 |psi>

Therefore, H |psi> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) |psi> - (9 A /8) ħ^2 |psi>

Compute this:

(15 A ħ^2 / 8 - 9 A ħ^2 / 8 ) |psi> = (6 A ħ^2 / 8 ) |psi> = (3 A ħ^2 /4 ) |psi>

Thus, the energy eigenvalue is 3 A ħ^2 /4.

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, let me re-examine the expression for H.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Another approach is to note that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed in terms of S_total^2.

We have S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )

Since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2 I, the sum is (9/4) ħ^2 I

Thus, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 I ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

So, correct so far.

Hence, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 I

So, for the state psi, which is in the s=3/2 subspace, S_total^2 |psi> = (15/4) ħ^2 |psi>

Thus, H |psi> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ^2 ) |psi> - (9 A)/8 ħ^2 |psi>

Compute:

First term: (15 A ħ^2)/8 |psi>

Second term: -(9 A ħ^2)/8 |psi>

Total: (6 A ħ^2)/8 |psi> = (3 A ħ^2)/4 |psi>

So, energy eigenvalue is (3 A ħ^2)/4.

But the given correct answer is 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the total spin is wrong?

Wait, if the state psi is in the s=1/2 subspace, then the eigenvalue would be different.

But wait, psi is symmetric, so it should be in the s=3/2 subspace.

Wait, maybe I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for the state psi.

Wait, but if psi is a symmetric state, it's in the s=3/2 subspace, so S_total^2 acting on psi gives a multiple of psi.

But perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, maybe the total spin of the state is 1/2, not 3/2?

But since the state is symmetric, it should be 3/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of H directly.

Compute E = <psi| H |psi>

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So E = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

Since the state is symmetric, the expectation values for S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 should all be the same.

Therefore, E = 3 A * <S1·S2>

So, compute <S1·S2>.

Recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2 )

We can compute <S1·S2> as (1/2)( <S1^2> + <S2^2> - <S_{12}^2> )

Since <S1^2> = (3/4) ħ^2

Similarly for <S2^2>

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( (3/4 ħ^2 ) + (3/4 ħ^2 ) - <S_{12}^2> )

= (1/2)( 3/2 ħ^2 - <S_{12}^2> )

= (3/4 ħ^2 - (1/2) <S_{12}^2> )

Now, I need to find <S_{12}^2> for the state psi.

S_{12}^2 is the square of the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

Since particles 1 and 2 can form a singlet (s=0) or a triplet (s=1).

We can write the state psi as a combination of singlet and triplet states.

But wait, psi is a symmetric state with two ups and one down. Let me try to express psi in terms of singlet and triplet states.

The singlet state for particles 1 and 2 is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2)

The triplet states are:

|1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩

|1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2)

|1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩

But our state psi is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3)

Wait, perhaps we can express each term in terms of singlet and triplet.

Wait, note that in the state psi, all terms have two ups and one down. So, perhaps it's better to consider the third particle's spin.

But perhaps if I fix particle 3's spin, and consider particles 1 and 2.

Wait, actually, I think this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, since psi is symmetric, and we know that it can be written as a combination of triplet and singlet states for particles 1 and 2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <S_{12}^2> directly.

Recall that S_{12}^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = ( <S_{12}^2> - 2*(3/4 ħ^2) ) /2

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, S1·S2 = (S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2

So, <S1·S2> = ( <S_{12}^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> ) /2

Since <S1^2> = <S2^2> = (3/4) ħ^2

Therefore,

<S1·S2> = ( <S_{12}^2> - (3/4 + 3/4) ħ^2 ) /2
          = ( <S_{12}^2> - (3/2) ħ^2 ) /2
          = ( <S_{12}^2> /2 - 3/4 ħ^2 )

But earlier, we have:

<S1·S2> = (3/4 ħ^2 - (1/2) <S_{12}^2> )

Set equal:

(3/4 ħ^2 - (1/2) <S_{12}^2> ) = ( <S_{12}^2> /2 - 3/4 ħ^2 )

So,

3/4 ħ^2 - (1/2) <S_{12}^2> = (1/2) <S_{12}^2> - 3/4 ħ^2

Bring terms with <S_{12}^2> to left and constants to right:

- (1/2) <S_{12}^2> - (1/2) <S_{12}^2> = -3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2

Combine:

- <S_{12}^2> = - (3/2) ħ^2

Therefore,

<S_{12}^2> = (3/2) ħ^2

Thus, going back to <S1·S2>:

<S1·S2> = (3/4 ħ^2 - (1/2)(3/2 ħ^2)) = (3/4 - 3/4) ħ^2 = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Because if <S1·S2> = 0, then <H> = 3 A * 0 = 0, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that it was an eigenfunction. Hmm, but according to this, the expectation value is zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's do it step by step.

We have two expressions for <S1·S2>:

From S1·S2 = (S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2,

so <S1·S2> = (<S_{12}^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2>)/2

We have:

< S_{12}^2 > = (3/2) ħ^2

< S1^2 > = < S2^2 > = 3/4 ħ^2

Therefore,

< S1·S2 > = ( (3/2 ħ^2 ) - (3/4 ħ^2 ) - (3/4 ħ^2 ) ) / 2
             = ( (3/2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ^2 ) / 2
             = ( (3/2 - 6/4 ) ħ^2 ) / 2
             = ( (3/2 - 3/2 ) ħ^2 ) / 2
             = 0 / 2
             = 0

So, <S1·S2> = 0

Similarly, <S1·S3> = 0, <S2·S3> = 0

Thus, <H> = A*(0 + 0 + 0) = 0

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion that it is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 3 A ħ^2 /4.

Thus, there's a contradiction, meaning that my initial assumption that psi is an eigenfunction must be wrong.

Wait, but how come? If psi is in the s=3/2 subspace, then H should be an eigenfunction.

But according to this calculation, the expectation value is zero, implying that it's not an eigenfunction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S_{12}^2>.

Wait, if I compute <S_{12}^2>, which is the average of the square of the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

But in the state psi, particles 1 and 2 can be in any combination, but since the state is symmetric, perhaps it's easier to compute it another way.

Let me write psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Let me consider the subspace of particles 1 and 2. For each term, I can write the state of particles 1 and 2, and the state of particle 3.

For example:

In |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↑⟩.

In |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↓⟩.

In |↓↑↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩.

Thus, the state of particles 1 and 2 across the entire psi can be considered as:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

But wait, each term has a different state for particle 3, but perhaps focusing on particles 1 and 2, we can write:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ )

Therefore, the state of particles 1 and 2 is:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

But this can be rewritten as:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

This is a symmetric state for particles 1 and 2.

Wait, but the symmetric states for two spin-1/2 particles are:

- The triplet: |↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), |↓↓⟩

- The singlet: (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2)

Our state is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

We can write this as:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

Let me express this in terms of the triplet and singlet states.

First, note that |↑↑⟩ = |1,1⟩,

(|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) = |1,0⟩,

|↓↓⟩ = |1,-1⟩.

But our state is:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = ( |1,1⟩ + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(3)

Wait, that is:

= |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |1,0⟩ / sqrt(2)

But this is a combination of triplet states, so the state is not a pure triplet or singlet state.

Therefore, when we compute <S_{12}^2> for psi, since it's a combination of triplet and singlet states, we can compute the expectation value.

Let me denote the triplet states as |t, m_t⟩, with m_t = 1, 0, -1,

and the singlet state as |s⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2)

Then, the state particles 1 and 2 in psi can be written as a combination of |t,1⟩, |t,0⟩, and |s⟩.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the state is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

We can express this as:

( |↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) + ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

= |↑↑⟩ / sqrt(3) + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

But since |↑↑⟩ is |t,1⟩,

and (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2) is |t,0⟩.

Therefore, our state can be written as:

|t,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |t,0⟩ / sqrt(1.5)

Wait, because the coefficient for |↑↑⟩ is 1/sqrt(3), and for |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ it's 1/sqrt(3), which is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = |t,0⟩ * sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2) = |t,0⟩ / sqrt(1.5) ?

Wait, maybe another approach.

Compute <S_{12}^2> as follows:

< S_{12}^2 > = < psi | S_{12}^2 | psi >

Since particles 3 is in a fixed state, perhaps we can factorize.

But actually, S_{12}^2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, while particle 3 is in a fixed state for each term.

Wait, perhaps I can express psi as follows.

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Let me group the states as:

= (1/sqrt(3)) ( |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ )

Therefore, we can write this as:

= |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ / sqrt(3) + |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ / sqrt(3) + |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ / sqrt(3)

But this doesn't directly help. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the part of particles 1 and 2 is:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

Therefore, the state of particles 1 and 2 is a combination of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, and |↓↑⟩.

But to compute <S_{12}^2>, which is the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2, which is the same as the spin of particles 1 and 2.

So, perhaps express the state as a combination of triplet and singlet states.

So, let me write the state as:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

Express this in terms of triplet and singlet.

We know that:

|↑↑⟩ = |1,1⟩

(|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) = |1,0⟩

|↓↓⟩ = |1,-1⟩

So, our state is:

( |1,1⟩ + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) ) / sqrt(3)

= |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |1,0⟩ / sqrt(2)

But also, the singlet state is:

(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = |0,0⟩

But our state is:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3) = ( |1,1⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

= |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

= |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |1,0⟩ / sqrt(2)

Wait, but |1,0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

So, writing our state as:

= |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |1,0⟩ / sqrt(2)

But this can be written as:

= ( |1,1⟩ + (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) |1,0⟩ ) / something

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a normalized combination of triplet states.

Let me compute the norm:

The norm squared is:

(1/sqrt(3))^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6

Therefore, the state can be written as:

( |1,1⟩ / sqrt(3) + |1,0⟩ / sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(5/6 )

But maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps compute < S_{12}^2 > directly.

Compute:

< S_{12}^2 > = < (S1 + S2)^2 > = < S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2 >

So, < S_{12}^2 > = < S1^2 > + < S2^2 > + 2 < S1·S2 >

But in the state psi, for particles 1 and 2, we have the state:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

Therefore, compute < S1^2 > = < S2^2 > = same as before, which is (3/4) ħ^2

Wait, but S1^2 and S2^2 are operators for particles 1 and 2.

But in the state for particles 1 and 2, which is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3), each particle's spin state is not the same.

Wait, actually, for S1^2 and S2^2, acting on the state of particles 1 and 2, they will give (3/4) ħ^2 for each.

Because S1^2 is ( (1/2)(1/2 +1
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. I need to determine whether the given spin state psi is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, calculate the expectation value of E.

The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(|up1> |up2> |down3> + |up1> |down2> |up3> + |down1> |up2> |up3>). So, it's a symmetric combination where two spins are up and one is down. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S_i for each particle is (1/2)σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So, S1·S2 would involve the dot product of the spin vectors, which for two particles is (1/2)^2 times the sum of the products of their Pauli matrices. But since we have three particles, I need to compute S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3, and sum them all up.

Wait, but actually, since the Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise interactions, maybe I can compute each term separately and then add them together.

Alternatively, I remember that the total spin squared operator is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, that means that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is equal to [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2.

Therefore, H can be written as A*[ (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2, where S_total is the total spin operator.

But for spin-1/2 particles, each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². So, H becomes A*[ (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ² ] / 2.

Therefore, the eigenvalue of H would be related to the eigenvalues of S_total².

Now, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be either S = 1 or S = 0. Wait, is that right? For two particles, the total spin can be 1 or 0, but for three particles, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or 0? Hmm, I might need to double-check that.

Actually, the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles depend on how they combine. The maximum spin is 3/2, which is when all three are aligned. Then, the next possible spins would be 1/2, which can come from various combinations, and 0, the singlet state.

So, the state psi given here is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. Let me see what the total spin of this state is.

Wait, let me count the number of up and down spins. In each term of psi, two particles are up and one is down. So, is this state symmetric under permutation of particles? Yes, because swapping any two particles doesn't change the state. So, it's a symmetric spin state.

Now, let's think about how to compute S_total² acting on psi. Since psi is symmetric, perhaps it's part of a multiplet with a certain total spin.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² on psi, which will help me find the expectation value of H.

But before that, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H directly.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, the expectation value of H is A times the expectation of (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, perhaps I can compute each term separately and sum them.

Given that, maybe the easiest way is to compute <psi|S1·S2|psi>, <psi|S1·S3|psi>, and <psi|S2·S3|psi>, and then sum them up and multiply by A.

But S_i·S_j = (1/4)(σ_i · σ_j) for spin-1/2 particles, because S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i)(1/2)(σ_j) = (1/4)σ_i·σ_j.

Therefore, S_i·S_j has eigenvalues (1/4)(1 + δ_ij), but actually, for i ≠ j, the eigenvalues are (1/4)(1) when the spins are aligned and (1/4)(-3) when they're anti-aligned. Wait, because σ_i·σ_j = 2S_i·S_j + (1/2)I, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i·σ_j - I). Therefore, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i·σ_j) - (1/2)I.

Wait, maybe I should step back. Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S = S1 + S2. Then, S² = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = (S² - S1² - S2²)/2.

So, for each pair (i,j), S_i·S_j = (S_total² - S_i² - S_j²)/2.

But since S_total is the sum of all three spins, perhaps we'll have to relate this to the total spin squared. Hmm, this seems similar to the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i·σ_j - I), as I thought before. So, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is (1/2)(<σ_i·σ_j> - 1).

So, for a given pair, say 1 and 2, what is <σ1·σ2> for the state psi?

Since the state psi is symmetric, maybe I can compute <σ1·σ2> for the state. Let me think. The state is a sum of three terms where each term is two ups and one down. Each term has specific positions for the down spin.

So, for the term |up1 up2 down3>, the spins of 1 and 2 are both up. So, σ1·σ2 would be (1)(1) = 1. Similarly, for the other two terms, in |up1 down2 up3> and |down1 up2 up3>, the first two spins are up and down, but wait, first term: first and second spins are up, second is down in the second term: up, down; and third term: down, up. So, in all three cases, for each term, the two spins in question (say 1 and 2) have one up and one down in two terms, and all up in one term?

Wait, no. Let's take the term |up1 up2 down3>. Here, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so σ1·σ2 = (+1)(+1) + ...? Wait, no, σ1·σ2 is the sum of the products of the Pauli matrices for each component.

Wait, hold on, no, that's incorrect. σ1·σ2 is the sum of the products of the Pauli matrices for each spin, which is actually σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z. So, when both spins are up, σ1_z σ2_z = (1)(1)=1, and σ1_x σ2_x = (1)(1)=1, same for y. So, σ1·σ2 = 3 when both are up.

Similarly, if one is up and the other is down, then σ1_z σ2_z = (1)(-1) = -1, and σ1_x σ2_x = (1)(-1) = -1, same for y. So, σ1·σ2 = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3.

If both are down, same as both up: 3.

But in the state psi, each term has two ups and one down. So, for each term, let's see:

First term: |up1 up2 down3>. For particles 1 and 2, they are both up, so σ1·σ2 = 3.

Second term: |up1 down2 up3>. For particles 1 and 2, up and down, so σ1·σ2 = -3.

Third term: |down1 up2 up3>. For particles 1 and 2, down and up, so σ1·σ2 = -3.

So, to compute <σ1·σ2>, I need to compute the expectation value over the state psi, which is (1/sqrt(3)) times the sum of these three terms.

So, <σ1·σ2> = (1/3)[ <first term|σ1·σ2|first term> + <second term|σ1·σ2|second term> + <third term|σ1·σ2|third term> ]

From above, the first term's contribution is 3, second and third terms' contributions are -3 each.

So, <σ1·σ2> = (1/3)(3 + (-3) + (-3)) = (1/3)(-3) = -1.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<σ1·σ2> - 1) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = (1/2)(-2) = -1.

Similarly, the same result would hold for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> because of the symmetry of the state psi. Each pair will have the same expectation value.

So, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = -1.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*(-1 -1 -1) = A*(-3).

But wait, the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ², which is positive. So, something's wrong here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my calculation is off because I didn't account for the fact that S1·S2 has an expectation value of -3/4. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, if each Pauli matrix expectation is (trace of σ_i in the state). But wait, no. Actually, when dealing with spin states, the expectation value of σ_i·σ_j is given by the sum of the expectations of each component.

But in this case, for each term in psi, which is |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up>, we can compute <σ1·σ2> for each term.

Wait, as I did before, each term is |up up down>, so for σ1·σ2, each component is up, so σ1_x σ2_x = 1*1 =1, same for y and z. So, 1+1+1=3.

Similarly, for |up down up>, σ1_x σ2_x = 1*(-1) = -1, σ1_y σ2_y = 1*(-1) = -1, σ1_z σ2_z = 1*1 =1. So, sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, actually, for |up down up>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so σ1·σ2 = (1)(-1) for each component? No, wait. No, σ1·σ2 is the sum of each component product. So, for σ1_x σ2_x, it's (1)(1) if both are up, (1)(-1) if one is up and the other is down, and (-1)(-1) if both are down.

Similarly for σ1_y and σ1_z.

So, for |up1 up2 down3>, σ1·σ2 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.

For |up1 down2 up3>, σ1·σ2 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(1) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

Similarly, for |down1 up2 up3>, σ1·σ2 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3.

Wait, hold on. Wait, σ1·σ2 is the sum of σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

In the term |up1 down2 up3>, σ1_x σ2_x = 1*(-1) = -1, σ1_y σ2_y = 1*(-1) = -1, σ1_z σ2_z = 1*1 =1. So, total is (-1)+(-1)+1= -1.

Similarly, for |down1 up2 up3>, σ1_x σ2_x=(-1)(1)= -1, σ1_y σ2_y=(-1)(1)= -1, σ1_z σ2_z=(-1)(1)= -1, so total is (-1)+(-1)+(-1)= -3.

Wait, so that's different from what I thought before. So, in the state psi, which is a symmetric combination of these three terms, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is:

(1/3)[3 + (-1) + (-3)] = (1/3)(-1) = -1/3.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/2)(<σ1·σ2> - 1) = (1/2)(-1/3 -1) = (1/2)(-4/3)= -2/3.

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, the expectation values of S1·S3 and S2·S3 will also be -2/3 each.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*(-2/3 -2/3 -2/3) = A*(-6/3) = A*(-2). Hmm, that's negative. But the correct answer is 2/3 A hbar², which is positive.

Wait, so where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of <σ1·σ2>. Let me think again.

Each term in the state psi is a product state with two ups and one down. For each term, when we compute <σ1·σ2>, we have to consider the expectation value in that term.

So, for the first term, |up1 up2 down3>, what's the expectation value of σ1·σ2? It's 3, as before.

For the second term, |up1 down2 up3>, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is -1, as we saw.

For the third term, |down1 up2 up3>, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is also -1, because σ1·σ2 would be:

σ1_x σ2_x = (-1)(1)= -1

σ1_y σ2_y = (-1)(1)= -1

σ1_z σ2_z = (-1)(1)= -1

Sum is -3, wait, that's different.

Wait, hold on. In |down1 up2 up3>, particle 1 is down, particles 2 and 3 are up.

So, for σ1·σ2, it's σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

Each of these components is (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 -1 -1 = -3. So, that's correct.

Wait, so for each term:

First term: |up up down> => σ1·σ2 = 3

Second term: |up down up> => σ1·σ2 = -1

Third term: |down up up> => σ1·σ2 = -3

Therefore, <σ1·σ2> = (1/3)(3 + (-1) + (-3)) = (1/3)(-1) = -1/3.

Thus, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(-1/3 -1) = (1/2)(-4/3) = -2/3.

So, each pair contributes -2/3.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*(-2/3 -2/3 -2/3) = A*(-6/3) = -2A.

But the correct answer is 2/3 A hbar², which is positive. So, I must have messed up.

Wait, maybe the Hamiltonian is actually H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is the same as A*(sum S_i·S_j). But in my calculation, I have a negative value. However, the correct answer is positive. So, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, let me think about the definition of the spin operator S_i.

In some conventions, S_i is (1/2)σ_i, but in others, it's (σ_i)/2. So, S_i·S_j would be (σ_i · σ_j)/4.

Wait, let me be precise.

Given S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)σ_i · (1/2)σ_j = (1/4)σ_i · σ_j.

Therefore, S_i·S_j = (1/4)σ_i·σ_j.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> is (1/4)<σ_i·σ_j>. So, earlier I computed <σ_i·σ_j> = -1/3, so <S_i·S_j> = (1/4)(-1/3) = -1/12.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, in my initial calculation, when I computed <σ_i·σ_j>, I got -1/3, but that was incorrect.

Wait, let's be precise.

Each term in psi is a product state with two ups and one down. So, for each term, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is computed as follows:

For |up1 up2 down3>, all spins are up for 1 and 2, so σ1·σ2 = 3.

For |up1 down2 up3>, spin 1 is up, spin 2 is down. So, σ1·σ2 = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.

Similarly, for |down1 up2 up3>, spin 1 is down, spin 2 is up. So, σ1·σ2 = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3.

Therefore, the average is (3 + (-1) + (-3))/3 = (-1)/3.

Therefore, <σ1·σ2> = -1/3.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/4)(-1/3) = -1/12.

Wait, no, wait: Earlier, I thought S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i·σ_j - I). Hmm, let's redo that.

Given that S_i is (1/2)σ_i, then S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i)(1/2)(σ_j) = (1/4)(σ_i·σ_j). So, S_i·S_j = (1/4)(σ_i·σ_j).

Thus, the expectation value is <S_i·S_j> = (1/4)<σ_i·σ_j> = (1/4)(-1/3) = -1/12.

But wait, that's negative, but perhaps I made a mistake in the definition.

Alternatively, some authors define S_i as σ_i/2, but perhaps we need to check the factor.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me calculate the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Since S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)^2 (σ_i · σ_j) = (1/4)(σ_i · σ_j).

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (1/4)<σ_i · σ_j>.

But σ_i · σ_j = 2S_i·S_j + (1/2)I, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i · σ_j - I). Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)<σ_i·σ_j> - (1/2)<I> = (1/2)<σ_i·σ_j> - 1/2.

So, if <σ_i·σ_j> = -1/3, then <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(-1/3) - 1/2 = (-1/6) - 1/2 = (-1/6 - 3/6) = -4/6 = -2/3.

Wait, so that brings us back to the earlier result. So, <S_i·S_j> = -2/3.

But earlier I thought S_i·S_j is (1/4)(σ_i·σ_j), so <S_i·S_j> = (1/4)(-1/3) = -1/12, but that contradicts.

Wait, no, perhaps the confusion is from the identity. Let me get this straight.

We have:

S_i · S_j = (1/2)σ_i · (1/2)σ_j = (1/4)(σ_i · σ_j).

But also, σ_i · σ_j = 2S_i · S_j + (1/2)I.

Therefore,

S_i · S_j = (1/2)(σ_i · σ_j - I).

So, which is the correct one?

Wait, both can't be. Let me write them:

From S_i = (1/2)σ_i, we have S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i/2)·(σ_j/2) = (1/4)(σ_i·σ_j).

But also, from the identity, σ_i·σ_j = 2 S_i·S_j + (1/2)I.

Thus, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i·σ_j - I).

Therefore, to resolve this, let's compute both expressions.

From S_i·S_j = (1/4)(σ_i·σ_j):

Then, σ_i·σ_j = 4 S_i·S_j.

But from the identity, σ_i·σ_j = 2 S_i·S_j + (1/2)I.

Therefore, 4 S_i·S_j = 2 S_i·S_j + (1/2)I

Which implies 4 S_i·S_j - 2 S_i·S_j = (1/2)I => 2 S_i·S_j = (1/2)I => S_i·S_j = (1/4)I.

Wait, but that can't be correct, unless S_i·S_j is (1/4)I, which is a scalar, but that's only true if all spins are in a singlet state, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the two expressions must be referring to different things. Maybe in different conventions, the spin operators are defined differently.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because of the definition of spin as either (1/2)σ or σ/2.

In some conventions, S_i = σ_i / 2, so S_i·S_j = (σ_i · σ_j)/4.

In others, S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)(σ_i · σ_j)/2 = (σ_i · σ_j)/4. So, same thing.

But in terms of identity, I think another approach is needed.

Perhaps I should not use the identity and instead, compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can also be related to the total spin.

For two particles, S_total² = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

Since S1² = (3/4)ħ², same for S2².

Therefore, for each pair, S1·S2 = (S_total² - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ²)/2 = (S_total² - (3/2)ħ²)/2.

So, perhaps I can compute S_total² for the state psi.

But wait, in this case, the state psi involves three particles, so S_total² is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

So, if I can compute S_total² acting on psi, I can find its eigenvalue, which would be useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the state in terms of total spin states.

Given that the state psi is symmetric, it's a triplet state? No, wait, triplet states have all three spins up, or two up and one down in symmetric combinations.

Wait, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S = 3/2, 1/2, 0.

The state with all spins up is the S=3/2 state.

The state with two spins up and one down can be either symmetric or antisymmetric, but in this case, the given state is symmetric. So, it's part of the triplet (S=1/2) or maybe a different multiplet.

Wait, perhaps it's part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, maybe I can construct the total spin states.

But this might get complicated, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since I can compute the expectation value of S_total².

But then, since H is a function of S_total², as I found earlier, H = A/2 (S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

Thus, to compute the expectation value of H, I can compute <H> = A/2 [<S_total²> - (9/4)ħ²].

So, if I can compute <S_total²>, that would give me the expectation value.

But S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, <S_total²> = <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But I already know that each <S_i·S_j> is -2/3, so <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3*(-2/3) = -2.

Also, <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = (3/4)ħ² each.

So, <S_total²> = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(-2) = (9/4)ħ² - 4.

Therefore, substituting back into H:

<H> = A/2 [ (9/4 ħ² - 4) - (9/4 ħ²) ] = A/2 [ -4 ] = -2A.

Wait, this is the same as before. So, <H> = -2A.

But according to the correct answer, it should be 2/3 A ħ², which is positive, and doesn't involve any negative constants. So, perhaps I have a missing factor somewhere, or maybe the Hamiltonian is in units where ħ² is set to 1, but since the given correct answer includes ħ², it's probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of <S_total²>.

Wait, let me compute <S_total²> again.

We have <S_total²> = <S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>.

So, as before, <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = (3/4)ħ² each.

Therefore, sum is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3*(-2/3) = -2.

Thus, <S_total²> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(-2) = 9/4 ħ² - 4.

So, returning to H = A/2 (S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

Therefore, <H> = A/2 ( (9/4 ħ² -4) - 9/4 ħ² ) = A/2 * (-4) = -2A.

Same result as before.

But the correct answer is 2/3 A hbar squared, which is positive. So, I must have a sign error.

Wait, perhaps the original Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is the same as A*(sum S_i·S_j). But wait, maybe the Hamiltonian is actually H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) with a positive coefficient, but perhaps I have a negative somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <H> as A*(sum <S_i·S_j>) = A*(-6/3) = A*(-2), but the correct answer is positive, so maybe the state is not an eigenfunction.

Wait, wait, but the state psi is symmetric, and the Hamiltonian is symmetric as well. But from the calculation, even if it's an eigenstate, the energy is negative. But the correct answer is positive. So, is it possible that I made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues properly.

Let me think again. The state psi is 1/sqrt(3)(|up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>). So, it's a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down.

What is the total spin of this state? Let me see.

The total spin S can be 1 or 0, but wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin is 3/2, 1/2, or 0.

The all-up state has total spin S=3/2.

The state psi is in the subspace of S=1/2.

Wait, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible spins are:

- S=3/2: one state (all spins up).

- S=1/2: some states. How many?

The multiplet for S=1/2 will have 2S+1 = 2 states, but actually, when you have three particles, you can have more states. Wait, no.

Wait, more accurately, the possible total spins for three spin 1/2 particles are:

- S=3/2: 1 state.

- S=1/2: 3 states.

- S=0: 1 state.

Yes, that's correct. Because the total Hilbert space is (1/2)^3 = 8 dimensions.

The S=3/2 state is 1 dimensional.

The S=0 state is 1 dimensional (singlet).

The S=1/2 multiplet has 2*(1/2) +1=3 states.

So, in the state psi, which is symmetric, and has two ups and one down, it must be in the S=1/2 subspace.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, the S=1/2 subspace has three states. Let me see.

One of them is the fully symmetric all-up state, but that's actually in the S=3/2 multiplet. Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the maximum spin is 3/2. The state with all spins up is S=3/2. Then, the other states in the S=1/2 multiplet must be in the subspace with two ups and one down.

Wait, but wait, the S=1/2 multiplet has three states:

1. | ↑ ↑ ↓ >.

2. | ↑ ↓ ↑ >.

3. | ↓ ↑ ↑ >.

So, exactly the state psi we have is one of them. But since the state is symmetric, and S=1/2 is symmetric, that must be part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Therefore, the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S=1/2.

Therefore, the eigenvalue of S_total² is S(S+1)ħ² = (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Wait, no, wait. For a multiplet with total spin S, the eigenvalue of S_total² is S(S+1)ħ².

Therefore, for the S=1/2 multiplet, S_total² |psi> = (1/2)(3/2)ħ² |psi> = (3/4)ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, now, going back to H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ) / 2 ).

As before, since S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

So, H = A/2 (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

Thus, substituting the eigenvalue of S_total², which is (3/4)ħ², into H, we get:

H |psi> = A/2 ( (3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) ) |psi> = A/2 ( (-6/4 ħ² ) ) |psi> = A/2 (-6/4) ħ² |psi> = (-3/4 A ħ² ) |psi>.

Wait, but according to the correct answer, the eigenvalue is (2/3) A ħ².

Hmm, this is still conflicting. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recast this.

If |psi> is in the S=1/2 multiplet, then S_total² |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

So, plugging into H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ) / 2 ).

As before.

So, <H> = A*( <S_total²> - <S1² + S2² + S3²> ) / 2.

We have <S_total²> = (3/4)ħ², since |psi> is an eigenstate.

And <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, <H> = A*( (3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( (-6/4
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, each spin operator S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z with eigenvalues of ħ/2 for up and -ħ/2 for down along the z-axis.

The given state psi seems to be a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, each term is a product state where two are up and one is down, and the down spin is on the third particle in each term. So, psi is symmetric under permutations of the particles, which might be a clue for its eigenstate properties.

Since the Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of the spin operators, let me write that out:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

I can expand each dot product:

S1·S2 = S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

But dealing with all these components might be complicated. Maybe I can think about the total spin or some invariant.

Wait, the state psi has two spins up and one spin down. So the total spin S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Maybe it's easier to consider the total spin squared operator, (S_total)^2, since it commutes with H.

But first, let me note that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be related to the total spin squared operator. Let's recall that:

(S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, rearranging that:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2

But for spin-1/2 particles, each S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So,

H = A[(S_total)^2 - (3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2] = A[(S_total)^2 - (9/8)ħ^2]

Therefore, H is a function of (S_total)^2, which is a Casimir operator. Since (S_total)^2 is a constant for states with definite total spin S, H will act on psi by scaling it according to its total spin.

So, psi is a state with two spins up and one spin down. Let me compute the total spin S of psi.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down. Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2.

To figure out which one applies here, I can look at the possible couplings. Starting with two spin-1/2 particles: their total spin can be S=1 or S=0. Then coupling that with the third spin-1/2.

If the first two have S=1, coupling with the third gives S_total = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 or |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

If the first two have S=0, coupling with the third gives S_total = 0 + 1/2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

But let me check the state psi. It's a symmetric state with two up and one down spin.

To find its total spin, perhaps I can decompose the space into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can note that the state psi is one of the triplet states when considering spin 1/2 particles.

Wait, actually, in three spin-1/2 particles, the state with two up and one down is a singlet (S=0) or part of a triplet (S=1). Wait, no, that's with two particles. For three particles, the situation is different.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible total spin S of the state psi. Since it's symmetric under permutation of the particles, perhaps it's in the symmetric representation.

But more concretely, let's compute the expectation value of (S_total)^2 in the state psi.

(S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, if I can compute <psi| (S_total)^2 |psi>, I can find <S_total^2>, and then plug into H.

Alternatively, since H is expressed in terms of (S_total)^2, and if psi is an eigenstate of (S_total)^2, then it's also an eigenstate of H.

So let's try to compute <psi| (S_total)^2 |psi>.

First, (S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, the expectation value <(S_total)^2> is equal to 3*(3/4 ħ^2) + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

Wait, but that seems circular because H is 2A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) (Wait, no, the H is A*(...), so H = A*(sum S_i·S_j).)

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Earlier, I had:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

And from expanding (S_total)^2, we have:

(S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore,

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [(S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2

So, H = A * [ (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

But since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4 ħ^2), we have:

H = A * [ (S_total)^2 - (3*(3/4 ħ^2)) ] / 2 = A * [ (S_total)^2 - (9/8 ħ^2) ] / 2

Wait, no: let's compute it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Let me recast:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

From the identity,

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

Therefore,

H = A * [ (S_total)^2 - (3*(3/4) ħ^2) ] / 2 = A [ (S_total)^2 - (9/8 ħ^2) ] / 2

Wait, that seems off. Wait, (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) is 3*(3/4 ħ^2) = 9/4 ħ^2.

Wait, yes, each S_i^2 is (3/4 ħ^2), so sum is 3*(3/4 ħ^2) = 9/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, H = A/2 [ (S_total)^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ]

So H = (A/2) (S_total)^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 )

But let me check again:

Starting from (S_total)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

Hence,

H = A * [ (S_total)^2 - (9/4 ħ^2) ] / 2 = (A/2) (S_total)^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 )

Yes, correct.

So, H is a linear combination of (S_total)^2 and a constant term.

Therefore, to find the expectation value of H in state psi, I can compute <psi | H | psi> = (A/2) <psi | (S_total)^2 | psi> - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 )

So, if I can compute <(S_total)^2>, then I can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, if psi is an eigenstate of (S_total)^2, then <(S_total)^2> would just be (S(S+1)) ħ^2, where S is the total spin.

So, let's try to figure out if psi is an eigenstate of (S_total)^2.

To do this, perhaps I can consider the action of (S_total)^2 on psi.

(S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Which is just the same as before.

But perhaps I can compute it on psi.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute <(S_total)^2> by expanding the state.

Alternatively, note that the state psi is symmetric under permutations of the particles, so it must be an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator.

Wait, why? Because the permutation group acts on the basis of the total spin states. So, symmetric states have definite total spin.

But wait, is that always the case? Hmm.

Wait, for three particles, the total spin states are either symmetric or antisymmetric under permutation, depending on the spin.

But perhaps to figure out the total spin of psi, I can note that it's the completely symmetric state with two up and one down spin.

Wait, let me think about the states.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation can be constructed by symmetrizing the product states. The possible states with two up and one down can be either symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, the state psi is symmetric because if you swap any two particles, say swap 1 and 2, the state becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the original state up1 up2 down3 because multiplication is commutative. So, the state is symmetric under any permutation.

Therefore, the state psi is in the symmetric subspace, which is spanned by states with well-defined total spin.

Thus, psi must be an eigenstate of (S_total)^2, so it's an eigenstate of H.

Hence, the expectation value will be the eigenvalue, which is (A/2) * S(S+1) ħ^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 )

So, if I can find S, the total spin of psi, I can find the expectation value.

To find S, the total spin, I need to figure out the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, it's known that three spin-1/2 particles can form a symmetric state with total spin S=3/2 and an antisymmetric state with S=1/2. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's recall that for three particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 and 1/2, but each has a specific symmetry.

Wait, actually, when you have three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, and the antisymmetric subspace is 3-dimensional. The symmetric subspace contains the triplet states (S=3/2) and the singlet state (S=0), but wait, no.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be from 3/2 down to 1/2 in steps of 1.

So S = 3/2, 1/2.

Each S corresponds to a multiplet. For S=3/2, the multiplet is 4-dimensional (since 2S + 1 = 4), and for S=1/2, it's 2-dimensional.

But the symmetric subspace under permutation is 4-dimensional (since the total symmetric states include S=3/2 and S=1/2). Similarly, the antisymmetric subspace is 3-dimensional.

Wait, but wait, the number of symmetric states is equal to the number of antisymmetric states when the total dimension is even, but for three particles, the total Hilbert space is 8-dimensional (since each spin-1/2 has 2 states, so 2^3=8). The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, and antisymmetric is 4-dimensional as well? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, no. The symmetric subspace is spanned by symmetric states, which under permutation, remain the same. For three particles, the number of symmetric states is (8 + 3)/2 = 5.5? That can't be. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the symmetric group S3 acts on the 8-dimensional Hilbert space, and the irreducible representations are determined by the spin of the particles.

Alternatively, the symmetric subspace consists of all states symmetric under permutation of the particles. For three particles, the symmetric subspace is spanned by the states with well-defined total spin, which includes the spin 3/2 multiplet and the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that the spin states can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.

But perhaps I should instead compute the total spin of psi.

Given that psi is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3), which is symmetric.

Let me consider the action of S_total^z on psi.

But S_total^z = S1^z + S2^z + S3^z.

Each S_i^z |psi> would act on each term. Let's compute S1^z |psi>.

S1^z acts on each term:

First term: up1 up2 down3. S1^z up1 = (1/2 ħ) up1.

Similarly, S2^z up2 = (1/2 ħ) up2, and S3^z down3 = (-1/2 ħ) down3.

Therefore, S1^z up1 up2 down3 = (1/2 ħ) up1 up2 down3

Similarly, S2^z up1 down2 up3 = (1/2 ħ) up1 down2 up3

S3^z up1 down2 down3 = (-1/2 ħ) up1 down2 down3

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, S1^z acts only on the first spin. So:

S1^z up1 up2 down3 = (1/2 ħ) up1 up2 down3

S1^z up1 down2 up3 = (1/2 ħ) up1 down2 up3

S1^z down1 up2 up3 = (-1/2 ħ) down1 up2 up3

So, applying S1^z to each term in the sum:

S1^z |psi> = (1/2 ħ) [ up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3 ]

Similarly, S2^z |psi> = (1/2 ħ) [ up1 up2 down3 + down1 up2 up3 + up1 down2 up3 ]

Wait, no, that's the same as S1^z |psi>.

Wait, no, S2^z acts on the second spin:

S2^z up1 up2 down3 = up1 (1/2 ħ up2) down3 = (1/2 ħ) up1 up2 down3

S2^z up1 down2 up3 = up1 ( -1/2 ħ down2 ) up3 = (-1/2 ħ) up1 down2 up3

S2^z down1 up2 up3 = down1 (1/2 ħ up2) up3 = (1/2 ħ) down1 up2 up3

Thus, S2^z |psi> = (1/2 ħ) [ up1 up2 down3 - up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3 ]

Similarly, S3^z |psi> = (-1/2 ħ) [ up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3 ]

So, S_total^z |psi> = (S1^z + S2^z + S3^z) |psi>

= [ (1/2 ħ)(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3) ]

+ [ (1/2 ħ)(up1 up2 down3 - up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3) ]

+ [ (-1/2 ħ)(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3) ]

Now, let's compute each part:

First term: (1/2 ħ)[T1 + T2 + T3]

Second term: (1/2 ħ)[T1 - T2 + T3]

Third term: (-1/2 ħ)[T1 + T2 + T3]

Where T1 = up1 up2 down3, T2 = up1 down2 up3, T3 = down1 up2 up3.

Adding them together:

First term + Second term + Third term:

(1/2 ħ)(T1 + T2 + T3) + (1/2 ħ)(T1 - T2 + T3) + (-1/2 ħ)(T1 + T2 + T3)

Let me factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ (T1 + T2 + T3) + (T1 - T2 + T3) - (T1 + T2 + T3) ]

Simplify the coefficients:

For T1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1

For T2: 1 -1 + 0 = 0

For T3: 1 +1 +0 = 2

So, it becomes (ħ/2)(T1 + 2 T3)

Therefore, S_total^z |psi> = (ħ/2)(T1 + 2 T3) = (ħ/2)(up1 up2 down3 + 2 down1 up2 up3)

But this is not a multiple of |psi>, so S_total^z |psi> is not a scalar multiple of |psi>, implying that |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total^z.

Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total spin squared operator acting on psi.

But let me recall that (S_total)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Since each S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4 ħ^2), we have:

(S_total)^2 = 3*(3/4 ħ^2) + 2*(sum S_i·S_j) = (9/4 ħ^2) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But wait, since H = A*(sum S_i·S_j), so sum S_i·S_j = H/A.

Thus, (S_total)^2 = (9/4 ħ^2) + 2*(H/A)

But that seems like a circular argument because H is in terms of S_total^2.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute (S_total)^2 |psi> and see if it's proportional to |psi>.

But that would require a lot of computation.

Alternatively, since I know that the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2, and the state is symmetric, let me check what the total spin could be.

If the state is symmetric and has two spins up and one down, I think that the total spin can be either S=1 or S=0 for two particles, but for three particles, it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I can think about the possible singlet and triplet states.

But for three particles, the singlet state is the totally antisymmetric state, which is not psi since psi is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is part of the triplet state with S=1.

Wait, but in three particles, the triplet states might correspond to S=1, but the singlet state S=0.

Wait, let me see:

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, is that correct? Because for three particles, the possible total spins are:

From 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2, you can have total spin 3/2 and 1/2.

Each of these corresponds to different multiplets.

The 3/2 multiplet has dimension 4, and the 1/2 multiplet has dimension 2.

Given that, the symmetric subspace for three particles is 4-dimensional, so it must contain the 3/2 multiplet.

But in our case, psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one down.

How many such states are there?

Well, for three particles, the number of symmetric states with two up and one down is equal to the number of ways to arrange the down spin, which is 3 (since the down can be on any one of the three particles). But since the state is symmetric, these three states can be combined in a symmetric way.

Wait, actually, the symmetric states with two up and one down are the sum of all permutations of the state with one down. Since each single state is antisymmetric under exchange of the down particle with another, but when you sum them, the total becomes symmetric.

Therefore, the state psi is a symmetric combination of all such states with one down.

But then, the dimension of the symmetric subspace for two up and one down is 3, but since we have 8 total states, I think it's part of the larger symmetric subspace.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible eigenvalues.

If psi is in the S=3/2 multiplet, then (S_total)^2 |psi> = (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ^2 |psi> = (15/4) ħ^2 |psi>

If psi is in the S=1/2 multiplet, then (S_total)^2 |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ^2 |psi> = (3/4) ħ^2 |psi>

So, if I can find the expectation value of (S_total)^2, I can determine whether it's 15/4 or 3/4, and thus whether psi is in S=3/2 or S=1/2.

So, let's compute <(S_total)^2> = <psi| (S_total)^2 |psi>

From earlier, (S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, <(S_total)^2> = 3*(3/4 ħ^2) + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = <H>/A

Therefore, <(S_total)^2> = (9/4 ħ^2) + 2*(<H>/A)

But we also have from earlier, H = (A/2)(S_total)^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 )

So, H |psi> = (A/2) <(S_total)^2> |psi> - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2)|psi>

But if psi is an eigenstate of (S_total)^2, then H |psi> = eigenvalue * |psi>

Therefore, if I can find <(S_total)^2>, I can find <H>.

But perhaps I need to compute <(S_total)^2> directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> directly.

Let me denote S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + (1/2) S_i^z S_j^z

Therefore, sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j = (1/4) sum_{i<j} (S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + (1/2) sum_{i<j} S_i^z S_j^z

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j in state psi.

Which is sum_{i<j} <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>

So, let's compute each term, say <psi | S1·S2 | psi>

This can be computed as:

<psi | S1·S2 | psi> = <psi | (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + (1/2)(S1^z S2^z) | psi>

Let me compute each part.

First, compute <psi | S1^+ S2^- | psi>

S1^+ |up> = 0, since spin-up is the highest state.

Wait, no, S1^+ is the raising operator, which takes spin down to spin up.

Similarly, S1^- is the lowering operator.

So, acting S1^+ S2^- on the state |up1 up2 down3> would be:

S1^+ |up1> = 0, since it's already spin-up.

So, S1^+ S2^- |up1 up2 down3> = 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |up1 up2 down3> = S1^- |up1> * S2^+ |up2> = (-ħ/2) |down1> * (ħ/2) |up2 down3>

Wait, but S2^+ |up2> = 0 since it's spin-up. Wait, no, S2^+ acts on |up2> to give zero, because |up> is the maximum state.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ |up1 up2 down3> = S1^- |up1> * S2^+ |up2> = (-ħ/2)|down1> * 0 = 0.

So, both terms in S1^+ S2^- and S1^- S2^+ acting on |up1 up2 down3> give zero.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- |up1 down2 up3> = S1^+ |up1> * S2^- |down2> = 0 * (-ħ/2)|down2> = 0.

And S1^- S2^+ |up1 down2 up3> = S1^- |up1> * S2^+ |down2> = (-ħ/2)|down1> * ħ/2 |up2> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>

Then, S1^+ S2^- |down1 up2 up3> = S1^+ |down1> * S2^- |up2> = ħ/2 |up1> * (-ħ/2)|down2> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 down2 up3>

And S1^- S2^+ |down1 up2 up3> = S1^- |down1> * S2^+ |up2> = (ħ/2)|up1> * 0 = 0.

Thus, putting it all together, S1^+ S2^- |psi> is a combination of terms:

From |up1 up2 down3>, 0

From |up1 down2 up3>, 0

From |down1 up2 up3>, (-ħ^2/4)|up1 down2 up3>

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- |psi> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 down2 up3>

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |psi> is:

From |up1 up2 down3>, 0

From |up1 down2 up3>, (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>

From |down1 up2 up3>, 0

So, S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>

Therefore, the sum S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ acting on |psi> gives:

(-ħ^2/4)|up1 down2 up3> + (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>

Which is -ħ^2/4 (|up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> )

Now, when we take the inner product with <psi |, we get:

<psi | S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (-ħ^2/4) [ <psi | (|up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) ]

But <psi | |up1 down2 up3> = 1/sqrt(3), similarly <psi | |down1 up2 up3> = 1/sqrt(3)

Therefore, this term becomes (-ħ^2/4)(1/sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3)) = (-ħ^2/4)(2/sqrt(3)) = (-ħ^2/4)*(2/√3) = (-ħ^2)/(2√3)

Now, the other term in S1·S2 is (1/2) S1^z S2^z.

Compute <psi | (1/2) S1^z S2^z | psi>

Note that S1^z |up1> = (ħ/2)|up1>, S1^z |down1> = (-ħ/2)|down1>

Similarly for S2^z.

Thus, (1/2) S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = (1/2)(ħ/2)(ħ/2)|up1 up2 down3> = (ħ^2/8)|up1 up2 down3>

Similarly, (1/2) S1^z S2^z |up1 down2 up3> = (1/2)(-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3> = (-ħ^2/8)|up1 down2 up3>

And (1/2) S1^z S2^z |down1 up2 up3> = (1/2)(-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ^2/8)|down1 up2 up3>

Therefore, summing over all terms, (1/2) S1^z S2^z |psi> is:

(ħ^2/8)|up1 up2 down3> - (ħ^2/8)|up1 down2 up3> - (ħ^2/8)|down1 up2 up3>

Then, <psi | (1/2) S1^z S2^z |psi> = (ħ^2/8)(1/sqrt(3)) - (ħ^2/8)(1/sqrt(3)) - (ħ^2/8)(1/sqrt(3)) = (-ħ^2/8)(1/sqrt(3))

Therefore, putting it all together, <psi | S1·S2 | psi> is:

[ (-ħ^2)/(2√3) ] + [ (-ħ^2)/(8√3) ] = (-ħ^2)/(2√3) - ħ^2/(8√3) = (-7 ħ^2)/(8√3)

Similarly, due to the symmetry of the problem, the expectation values of S1·S3 and S2·S3 will be the same.

Thus, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = (-7 ħ^2)/(8√3)

Therefore, sum <S_i·S_j> = 3 * (-7 ħ^2)/(8√3) = (-21 ħ^2)/(8√3)

But wait, let's check that. Wait, in our case, each S_i·S_j term is similar because of the symmetry of the state. So, yes, all three cross terms should have the same expectation value.

Therefore, <sum S_i·S_j> = 3 * (-7 ħ^2)/(8√3) = (-21 ħ^2)/(8√3)

Thus, going back to H:

H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) = A*(-21 ħ^2)/(8√3)

Wait, but according to the correct answer, the energy is (2/3) A ħ^2.

Hmm, this doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, in S1·S2, I had <psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (-7 ħ^2)/(8√3)

But wait, let me compute the exact value step by step again.

From S1^+ S2^- |psi> = (-ħ^2/4)(|up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> )

But |psi> is (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3>)/sqrt(3)

Thus, <psi | S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |psi> is:

(-ħ^2/4) * [ <psi | (|up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) ]

Which is (-ħ^2/4) * [ (1/sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3)) ] = (-ħ^2/4)*(2/sqrt(3)) = (-ħ^2)/(2 sqrt(3))

Similarly, the S1^z S2^z term was:

(1/2) S1^z S2^z
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem here about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian and a given spin state. I need to determine whether this state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian and, if it is, find its energy. If not, I have to compute the expectation value of the energy. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with energy (2/3)Aℏ², but I need to verify that.

First, let me write down the given information clearly.

The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for particle i.

The spin state is given as ψ = 1/√3*(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃). So, it's a symmetric state where two spins are up and one is down, but arranged in a cyclic permutation.

My goal is to check if ψ is an eigenstate of H. To do this, I can compute Hψ and see if it's equal to some multiple of ψ. If Hψ = Eψ, then ψ is indeed an eigenstate with energy E.

But to compute Hψ, I need expressions for S1, S2, S3. Since these are spin-1/2 particles, each S_i is (ℏ/2)σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. However, for spin operators, the spin matrices for each particle are along their respective axes.

But dealing with matrices for three particles might get a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Alternatively, I can think about the total spin squared operator, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, we get:

S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

So, substituting this into H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

Since each S_i² is (ℏ/2)(ℏ/2 + 1) = (3/4)ℏ² for spin-1/2 particles, we have:

H = A*(S_total² - 3*(3/4)ℏ²)/2 = A*(S_total² - (9/4)ℏ²)/2

So, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8)ℏ²

Therefore, the eigenstates of H are the same as the eigenstates of S_total², which are the total spin states.

Now, the state ψ given is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. Let me see what the total spin of this state is.

Wait, the state ψ is a combination of three terms: ↑↑↓, ↑↓↑, ↓↑↑. So, each term has two spins up and one down. Since all terms are symmetric under permutation, this state is symmetric.

But what is the total spin S_total² for such a state?

First, let's compute the total spin squared operator S_total² for the state ψ.

To do this, I can compute the expectation value of S_total² acting on ψ.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so the expectation value is <ψ|S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|ψ>.

But since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), we can relate this to S_total².

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in the case of three particles, the total spin can take values S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. But in our case, the state ψ has two spins up and one spin down, which isn't a triplet or a singlet in the two-particle case.

Wait, actually, for three particles, the states with two spins up and one spin down can form a triplet (with S = 1/2) or a singlet (S=0). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should consider the possible total spin.

But maybe it's better to compute S_total² for the state ψ.

Alternatively, let me think about the eigenvalues of S_total². For a system of three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The state ψ is symmetric, so it's in one of these representations.

Let me check. The state ψ is symmetric under permutation of particles. So, if it's a triplet state (S=1/2), it must be symmetric. Let's recall that the triplet states are symmetric and have total spin S=1/2, while the singlet state is antisymmetric with S=0, but that's for two particles.

Wait, no, for three particles, there's a different structure. The symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2, while the antisymmetric states can have S=3/2 or S=1/2 as well.

Wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

Each spin-1/2 particle has spin up or down. The state ψ is a symmetric combination of three terms: two up and one down, arranged in a symmetric way.

But to compute the total spin, I can look at the action of S_total² on the state.

Alternatively, let's consider the state ψ and compute its expectation value of S_total².

Expressed in terms of spin operators:

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, to compute <ψ|S_total²|ψ>, we can write it as:

<ψ|S1² + S2² + S3²|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ>

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so:

<ψ|H|ψ> = A*(<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ>)

Which is the expectation value of H on ψ, but we also have the term from S_total².

Since S_total² is related to H, maybe I can express the expectation value of H in terms of S_total².

Wait, from the earlier relation:

H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8)ℏ²

Therefore, the expectation value of H is:

<A = (A/2)<S_total²> - (9A/8)ℏ²

So, if I can compute <S_total²>, I can find <H>.

So, let me compute <ψ|S_total²|ψ> = <ψ|(S1 + S2 + S3)^2|ψ>

Expanding this, it's the same as:

<ψ|S1²|ψ> + <ψ|S2²|ψ> + <ψ|S3²|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + 2<ψ|S2·S3|ψ>

Since each S_i² = (ℏ/2)^2 * (σ_i ⊗ I ⊗ I + I ⊗ σ_i ⊗ I + I ⊗ I ⊗ σ_i) for each particle, but maybe I should compute each term.

Alternatively, since all particles are identical and the state ψ is symmetric, the expectation values of S1², S2², S3² are all equal.

So, <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = (ℏ²/4)(1/2)(1/2 +1) = (ℏ²/4)(3/4) = 3ℏ²/16? Wait, no.

Wait, each spin is spin-1/2, so S_i² has eigenvalues (ℏ/2)^2 * ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) = (ℏ²/4)(3/4) = 3ℏ²/16.

Wait, no, S_i² for a spin-1/2 particle is (ℏ²/4) * (1/2)(1/2 +1) = (ℏ²/4)(3/4) = 3ℏ²/16. So each <S_i²> = 3ℏ²/16.

But wait, actually, the expectation value of S_i² for a spin-1/2 state in the up or down state is (ℏ²/4)(1/2)(1/2 +1) = 3ℏ²/16, yes.

So, <S1²> = <S2²> = <S3²> = 3ℏ²/16.

Therefore, the sum <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 9ℏ²/16.

Now, what about the cross terms: 2<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + 2<ψ|S2·S3|ψ>

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)² - S1² - S2²

So, similarly, <S1·S2> = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)²> - <S1²> - <S2²>

But, for the given state ψ, which is symmetric, we can think about the action of S1 + S2.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, note that in the state ψ, each term is two up spins and one down spin. Let me see what the expectation value of S1·S2 is.

Compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>

Since S1 and S2 are spin-1/2 operators, their dot product is S1·S2 = (ℏ²/4) σ1 · σ2 = (ℏ²/4)(σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z)

So, to compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>, I can write this as (ℏ²/4) <ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ>

The eigenvalues of σ1·σ2 can be -3 for singlet state and +1 for triplet state. However, our state ψ is not a singlet or triplet state of two spins, because the third spin is also involved.

Wait, but in the given state ψ, we have three particles. So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the state ψ may not directly correspond to a singlet or triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it explicitly.

The state ψ is a sum of three terms:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Where |↑↑↓⟩ is the state where particles 1 and 2 are up, and particle 3 is down, etc.

So, let me write out ψ as:

ψ = 1/√3 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

I need to compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>

Let me compute this by expanding the terms.

First, note that S1·S2 acts on each term in ψ.

Let me write ψ as a sum |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩, where:

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩

|b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩

|c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩

Then, S1·S2 |a⟩ = S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly for S1·S2 |b⟩ and S1·S2 |c⟩.

But maybe it's better to compute the matrix elements.

Alternatively, note that S1·S2 acts on each term and can be expressed as follows.

Recall that S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)(S1² + S2²)

Wait, no, the correct identity is:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)(S1² + S2²)

Wait, let me verify:

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2

So, S1·S2 = [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2²]/2

Yes, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (1/2)(S1² + S2²)

Therefore, the expectation value <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> is:

(1/2)<ψ|(S1 + S2)^2|ψ> - (1/2)(<S1²> + <S2²>)

We already know that <S1²> = <S2²> = 3ℏ²/16.

So, the second term is (1/2)(3ℏ²/16 + 3ℏ²/16) = (1/2)(6ℏ²/16) = (3ℏ²)/16.

Now, let's compute <ψ|(S1 + S2)^2|ψ>

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2

Wait, but that's the same as the previous identity.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S_total², so (S1 + S2)^2 = S_total² - 2 S3(S1 + S2) + S3²

Hmm, maybe that complicates things.

Alternatively, since we have the state ψ, perhaps we can compute <(S1 + S2)^2> directly.

Note that S1 + S2 is a vector operator. So, <(S1 + S2)^2> is the sum of the squares of the components plus the cross terms.

But this might get too involved. Maybe a better approach is to note that in the state ψ, the spins are arranged such that two are up and one is down.

Let me think about the expectation value of S1·S2 for the state ψ.

Since each term in ψ has two up spins and one down, let's see:

In |↑↑↓⟩, S1 and S2 are both up. So S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is (ℏ²/4)(1·1 + 0 + 0) = ℏ²/4.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, so S1·S2 = (ℏ²/4)(0 + 0 -1) = -ℏ²/4.

Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, S1 is down, S2 is up, so S1·S2 = -ℏ²/4.

Therefore, when S1·S2 acts on each term, it gives:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩

S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (-ℏ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩

S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (-ℏ²/4)|↓↑↑⟩

Therefore, when we act S1·S2 on ψ, we get:

S1·S2 ψ = (ℏ²/4)(|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩)/√3

Therefore, the inner product <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> is:

(1/3)[<↑↑↓| - <↑↓↑| - <↓↑↑|] times (ℏ²/4)(|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩)

Compute this:

= (1/3)(ℏ²/4) [ <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> - <↑↑↓|↑↓↑> - <↑↑↓|↓↑↑> - <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> + <↑↓↑|↑↓↑> + <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> - <↓↑↑|↑↑↓> + <↓↑↑|↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑|↓↑↑> ]

But all the cross terms <↑↑↓|↑↓↑> = 0, because they are orthogonal (different number of up spins). Similarly, <↑↑↓|↓↑↑> = 0, <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> = 0, etc.

So, only the diagonal terms survive:

= (1/3)(ℏ²/4) [1 + 1 + 1] = (1/3)(ℏ²/4)(3) = ℏ²/4

So, <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = ℏ²/4

Similarly, by symmetry, <ψ|S1·S3|ψ> = ℏ²/4 and <ψ|S2·S3|ψ> = ℏ²/4

Therefore, the cross terms sum up to 2*(ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = 2*(3ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/2

Wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Actually, the expansion of <ψ|S_total²|ψ> is:

<ψ|S1² + S2² + S3²|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ>

We have <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 9ℏ²/16

And 2<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ> = 2*(ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = 2*(3ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/2

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I computed each <S_i·S_j> as ℏ²/4, so each term is ℏ²/4, and there are three terms. So, the sum is 3*(ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/4. Then, multiplied by 2, it becomes 3ℏ²/2.

Therefore, total <S_total²> = 9ℏ²/16 + 3ℏ²/2 = 9ℏ²/16 + 24ℏ²/16 = 33ℏ²/16

Wait, but this seems high. Let me verify.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms.

Because 2<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + 2<ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + 2<ψ|S2·S3|ψ> is equal to 2*(<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + <ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + <ψ|S2·S3|ψ>)

Which is 2*(ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = 2*(3ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/2.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, <S_total²> = 9ℏ²/16 + 3ℏ²/2 = 9ℏ²/16 + 24ℏ²/16 = 33ℏ²/16

So, S_total² |ψ> = (33ℏ²/16)|ψ>

Therefore, plugging back into H:

H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8)ℏ²

So, the expectation value of H is:

<A = (A/2)*(33ℏ²/16) - (9A/8)ℏ²

Compute this:

= (33A ℏ²)/(32) - (9A ℏ²)/8

Convert 9Aℏ²/8 to 36Aℏ²/32.

So,

= (33Aℏ² - 36Aℏ²)/32 = (-3Aℏ²)/32

Wait, this gives a negative expectation value? But the supposed eigenvalue is positive, 2Aℏ²/3.

Hmm, that's concerning. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's double-check the <S_total²> computation.

We had:

<S_total²> = <S1² + S2² + S3²> + 2<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ>

We had <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 9ℏ²/16

And 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>) = 2*(ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = 2*(3ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/2

So, total <S_total²> = 9ℏ²/16 + 3ℏ²/2

But 3ℏ²/2 is 24ℏ²/16, so total is 9 + 24 = 33ℏ²/16.

So that part seems correct.

Then, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8)ℏ²

Therefore, <H> = (A/2)(33ℏ²/16) - (9A/8)ℏ²

Compute each term:

(A/2)(33ℏ²/16) = (33Aℏ²)/32

(9A/8)ℏ² = (36Aℏ²)/32

So, <H> = (33Aℏ²/32) - (36Aℏ²/32) = (-3Aℏ²)/32

Negative expectation value? That seems odd because the Hamiltonian is a sum of spin interactions which are typically positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when expanding S_total².

Let me double-check the expression for H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

And S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

So, H = A*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

So, H = (A/2) S_total² - (A/2)(S1² + S2² + S3²)

So, my previous calculation was incorrect because I said H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8)ℏ², but that's not correct.

Actually, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3ℏ²/16) = 9ℏ²/16

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total² - (A/2)(9ℏ²/16)

So, correctly, <H> = (A/2)<S_total²> - (A/2)(9ℏ²/16)

We had <S_total²> = 33ℏ²/16

Therefore,

<H> = (A/2)(33ℏ²/16) - (A/2)(9ℏ²/16) = (A/2)(24ℏ²/16) = (A/2)(3ℏ²/2) = (3Aℏ²)/4

Wait, that's different. So, 33ℏ²/16 - 9ℏ²/16 = 24ℏ²/16 = 3ℏ²/2

Then, (A/2)*(3ℏ²/2) = (3Aℏ²)/4

So, <H> = 3Aℏ²/4

But the expected answer was 2Aℏ²/3.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in computing <S_total²>.

Wait, let me go back. When I computed <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>, I got ℏ²/4. Let's verify that again.

Compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (ℏ²/4) <ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ>

In our state ψ, which is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

So, what is <σ1·σ2> in this state?

For each term in ψ, compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2.

Looking at |↑↑↓⟩: σ1·σ2 = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(-1) = 1

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩: σ1·σ2 = (1)(-1) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) = -1

For |↓↑↑⟩: σ1·σ2 = (-1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = -1

So, each term contributes:

|↑↑↓⟩: 1

|↑↓↑⟩: -1

|↓↑↑⟩: -1

But in ψ, each term is 1/√3. Therefore, the expectation value is:

(1/√3)^2 [1 + (-1) + (-1)] = (1/3)(-1) = -1/3

Therefore, <σ1·σ2> = -1/3

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (ℏ²/4)*(-1/3) = -ℏ²/12

Wait, earlier I thought it was ℏ²/4, which was incorrect.

So, in fact, <S1·S2> = -ℏ²/12

Wait, so my mistake was in the initial computation. I incorrectly assumed that each term's contribution was ℏ²/4, but actually, the expectation value is negative.

So, let's correct this.

Compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (ℏ²/4) <σ1·σ2> = (ℏ²/4)(-1/3) = -ℏ²/12

Similarly, due to the symmetry of the state, <S1·S3> = -ℏ²/12 and <S2·S3> = -ℏ²/12

Thus, the sum of the cross terms is:

2*( -ℏ²/12 - ℏ²/12 - ℏ²/12 ) = 2*(-ℏ²/4) = -ℏ²/2

Therefore, now <S_total²> = <S1² + S2² + S3²> + 2<ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ>

= 9ℏ²/16 + 2*(-ℏ²/4) = 9ℏ²/16 - ℏ²/2

Convert ℏ²/2 to 8ℏ²/16

So,

= 9ℏ²/16 - 8ℏ²/16 = ℏ²/16

Wait, that's very different.

Wait, 9ℏ²/16 - 8ℏ²/16 = 1ℏ²/16

So, <S_total²> = ℏ²/16

Thus, plugging back into H:

H = (A/2) S_total² - (A/2)(9ℏ²/16)

Therefore, <H> = (A/2)(ℏ²/16) - (A/2)(9ℏ²/16) = (A ℏ²)/32 - (9A ℏ²)/32 = (-8A ℏ²)/32 = -A ℏ²/4

Wait, now we have a negative expectation value again. That doesn't make sense, as the Hamiltonian is a sum of positive terms.

Wait, clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, S_total² can't be smaller than ℏ²/16. For three spin-1/2 particles, the minimum S_total² is (ℏ²)( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) * something? Wait, no.

Wait, the total spin S can be either 3/2 or 1/2 for three spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, S_total² has eigenvalues S(S+1)ℏ².

Therefore, for S=1/2, S_total² = (3/4)ℏ², and for S=3/2, S_total² = (15/4)ℏ².

But in our case, <S_total²> turned out to be ℏ²/16, which is way smaller than both 3ℏ²/4 and 15ℏ²/4.

Therefore, my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let's step back.

Perhaps I'm using the wrong basis.

Wait, the state ψ is given as (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

But wait, is this a symmetric state?

Yes, because it's a sum over all permutations of two ups and one down.

So, it's an eigenstate of the permutation group, so it's symmetric.

But perhaps its total spin is 1/2.

Wait, if the state is symmetric, its total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But let's compute the total spin.

Another approach: Compute the eigenvalue of S_total² in this state.

We can consider the action of S_total² on ψ.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, note that for the state ψ, the number of up spins is two and down is one.

But the total spin is not directly determined by the number of up spins.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the action of S_total² on ψ.

But since ψ is symmetric, it can be in either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But to find out which one, maybe we can use the fact that the singlet state for three particles (with S=1/2) has certain properties.

Wait, actually, for three particles, the spin states with S=1/2 come in four states (since 2S +1 = 2*1 +1 =3, but wait, no, for three particles, the decomposition is different).

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But how do we know which one it is?

Alternatively, let's compute the action of S_z on ψ.

Compute the total z-component of spin.

In the state ψ, each term has two spins up (+1/2 each) and one spin down (-1/2). So, the total S_z is 2*(1/2) + (-1/2) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Therefore, S_z |ψ> = (1/2)|ψ>

Hence, the eigenvalue of S_z is 1/2.

Therefore, the total spin S ≥ 1/2, so possible S=1/2 or S=3/2.

So, the state ψ has S_z = 1/2, S=1/2 or 3/2.

But we need to find S.

Compute S(S+1)ℏ² for the state ψ.

We can compute S_total² |ψ> = S(S+1)ℏ² |ψ>

Earlier, when I tried to compute <S_total²>, I got conflicting results, so perhaps the mistake was in that calculation.

Wait, let's see. Maybe the error was that I tried to compute <S1·S2> as -ℏ²/12, but that might not be correct.

Wait, actually, let's compute <S1·S2> correctly.

We have:

S1·S2 = (ℏ²/4)(σ1·σ2)

So, <S1·S2> = (ℏ²/4) <σ1·σ2>

But in the state ψ, which is symmetric, how do we compute <σ1·σ2>?

Note that σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z

Compute the expectation value in state ψ.

Given that ψ is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3

First, let's note that the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is:

(1/3)[ <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> + <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↓↑↑> + <↑↓↑|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓> + <↑↓↑|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> + <↑↓↑|σ1·σ2|↓↑↑> + <↓↑↑|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓> + <↓↑↑|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑|σ1·σ2|↓↑↑> ]

But in each term, σ1·σ2 acts on two particles, and the third is in a different state.

For the diagonal terms:

<↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓> = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(-1) = 1

Similarly, <↑↓↑|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> = (1)(-1) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) = -1

<↓↑↑|σ1·σ2|↓↑↑> = (-1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = -1

For the off-diagonal terms:

<↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) acting on the third particle which is down. Wait, no, actually, the operator σ1·σ2 only acts on particles 1 and 2, particle 3 is untouched.

Wait, no, in the product |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are up, and particle 3 is down.

When σ1·σ2 acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it acts on particles 1 and 2, resulting in (1)(1) + 0 + 0 times |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, σ1·σ2 acts on particles 1 and 2, which are |↑↓⟩, so gives (1)(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 times |↑↓↑⟩

Similarly, for |↓↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 acts on particles 1 and 2, which are |↓↑⟩, so gives (-1)(1) + 0 + 0 = -1 times |↓↑↑⟩

So, let's recompute the expectation <σ1·σ2>:

= (1/3)[ <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑> + <
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian, and I need to figure out if a given spin-state is an eigenfunction of this Hamiltonian. If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value. The Hamiltonian is given as H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). Hmm, okay. 

First, I remember that for spin systems, the total spin operator is often useful. For two particles, S_total = S1 + S2, and the dot product S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the total spin. The formula I recall is S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Since the Hamiltonian here is a sum of three such dot products, perhaps I can rewrite H in terms of the total spin operators.

So, let me denote S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, each pair's dot product can be written as (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2, and similarly for the other pairs. Therefore, H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). 

Let me simplify that expression:

H = A/2 [ 3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ]

Wait, how did I get that? Let's see: Each S_total^2 term appears three times (once in each pair), so that's 3*S_total^2. Then, the negative terms are each S1^2, S2^2, S3^2, each appearing twice (since each particle is in two pairs: 1 is in (1,2) and (1,3), etc.). So each S_i^2 term is subtracted twice. So, indeed, the total expression becomes 3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). Therefore, H = A/2 [3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Hmm, okay. So, H can be written in terms of S_total^2 and individual spin squares. That might be useful because if the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's also an eigenstate of H. So, I need to check if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

What's S_total^2 acting on psi? Let me recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Oh, wait a second, that's interesting because our Hamiltonian is proportional to S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, H is related to S_total^2. Specifically, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. So, that's consistent with what I had earlier.

But to find if psi is an eigenstate of H, we can check if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2. Because if it is, then H will act on it by giving an eigenvalue. So, let me try to compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

First, let's note that each S_i^2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, S_total^2 acting on psi would give us S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ², then S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Wait, but in our expression for H, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ). So, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²). Thus, H psi = (A/2) S_total^2 psi - (A/2)(9/4)ħ² psi.

But if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H psi would be proportional to psi, so the state would be an eigenstate of H. Therefore, I need to see if S_total^2 psi is proportional to psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the action of S_total^2 on psi by expanding S_total^2 in terms of the individual spin operators.

Wait, maybe I should instead look at the spin configuration of psi. Let me write down the state. The state is a symmetric combination of three terms, each with two spins up and one spin down. So, it's a symmetric state under permutation of the particles. Hmm, that suggests that the total spin might be zero or something else.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. Because when you combine three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be either 3/2 (all aligned) or 1/2 (with various couplings). So, the state psi is symmetric, so it's in the S=1/2 multiplet, because symmetric states are usually in the higher spin states? Or wait, maybe not necessarily, because for three particles, the symmetry might correspond to different things.

Wait, actually, for two particles, the symmetric states are spin singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1). For three particles, the symmetry is more complicated. So, perhaps psi is a singlet state, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

If I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi, then I can find the eigenvalue. So, let me try that.

First, let's write down the state psi:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So, it's symmetric in the spins. Therefore, maybe it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, if psi is symmetric, does that imply that it's an eigenstate of S_total^2? Not necessarily, but perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for S_total^2 in terms of individual spins.

But to compute S_total^2 acting on psi, perhaps I can express S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/(A), since H = A*(S1·S2 + ...).

Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi, but actually, I need the action of S_total^2 on psi, which is the same as the expectation value if psi is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in psi and see if it's an eigenvalue.

Wait, let's try that. So, the expectation value of S_total^2 is the expectation of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding that, it's the expectation of S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ², the expectation of S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 is 9/4 ħ².

Now, the expectation of S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1·S2). Wait, no: the expectation of S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1·S2 + S2·S1), but since S1·S2 is already an operator, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. Let me denote that as E_pair.

But perhaps I can compute E_pair = <psi| S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 |psi>.

Each term in the sum is the dot product between two spin operators.

The dot product S_i·S_j is (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). The expectation value of S_i·S_j in the state psi is the sum of the expectations of each component.

So, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), compute <psi| S_i^x S_j^x |psi>, same for y and z.

But this might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

First, let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

First, let's compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

In the state psi, each term is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

So, when S1^z S2^z acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it gives (+1/2)(+1/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly for the other terms.

So, let's compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>:

= (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] * S1^z S2^z * [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ] * (1/sqrt(3)).

Wait, actually, I should more carefully compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the state psi is an eigenstate of the total spin in z-direction? Let me see.

Wait, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of spins. If the state is symmetric, then it's an eigenstate of S_z^total = S1^z + S2^z + S3^z. Let me compute S_z^total psi.

In each term of psi, there are two spins up and one spin down. So, each term has S_z^total = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So, each term in psi has S_z^total = 1/2 ħ. Therefore, S_z^total psi = (1/2 ħ) |psi>.

So, psi is an eigenstate of S_z^total with eigenvalue (3/2) * (1/2) ħ? Wait, no. Wait, S_z^total is the sum of the individual S_z's, so each |↑↑↓⟩ has S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2, so total S_z = +1/2 +1/2 -1/2 = +1/2. Similarly for the other terms, so each term in psi has S_z = +1/2, so S_z^total psi = (1/2 ħ) psi. So, yes, psi is an eigenstate of S_z^total with eigenvalue (1/2)ħ.

Therefore, the state is not an eigenstate of S_total^2 unless it's also an eigenstate of S_total^x and S_total^y. Hmm, so perhaps the state has well-defined S_z, but not necessarily S_total^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that S_total^2 = (S_total^z)^2 + S_total^x^2 + S_total^y^2.

Since we know S_total^z psi = (1/2 ħ) psi, so (S_total^z)^2 psi = (1/2 ħ)^2 psi. 

So, S_total^2 psi = (S_total^z)^2 psi + S_total^x^2 psi + S_total^y^2 psi.

Therefore, if I can compute the expectation values of S_total^x^2 and S_total^y^2, then I can find the expectation of S_total^2.

But wait, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then the expectation value is <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We already know <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ², so their sum is 9/4 ħ².

Then, 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> is 2 * <H/A>, since H = A*(S1·S2 + ...).

So, let me compute <H> = <psi| H |psi> = A * ( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ).

So, if I can find <S1·S2>, I can get <H>.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the expectation of S_total^2, which is <S_total^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2 + ...>.

Thus, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 <H/A>.

So, if I can compute <S_total^2>, I can find <H>.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Given that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, let me compute this for each term in psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state psi is symmetric, so maybe it's an eigenstate of the permutation group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (total spin zero) is different from this state.

Wait, the singlet state for three spins is a state where the total spin is zero. But I don't remember the exact form. Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is in the triplet state with total spin 1/2.

Wait, the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi is symmetric, so it can be in the 3/2 multiplet or the 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, the 3/2 multiplet is symmetric under permutation, but the 1/2 multiplet is also symmetric. Hmm, so maybe it's either one or the other.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the value of S_total^2 acting on psi.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S_total^2 = 3*(3/4 ħ²) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Wait, no. Each S_i^2 is (3/4) ħ², so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ².

So, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 when acting on psi, then I can find the expectation value of H.

But perhaps another approach is to note that the given state is symmetric, and perhaps acts as an eigenstate under the action of S_total^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent the state in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi is symmetric, so it's in the 1/2 multiplet, not the 3/2 one? Because the 3/2 multiplet is symmetric, but perhaps it's not. Wait, actually, no, the 3/2 multiplet is symmetric, but each state in the multiplet is symmetric under permutation.

Wait, actually, the total spin states are either symmetric or antisymmetric under permutation, depending on the spin.

Wait, for three particles, the total spin states can be constructed as symmetric or antisymmetric. Since our state is symmetric, it must be in the symmetric spin state.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalue of S_total^2. Let me try constructing S_total^2 acting on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

So, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi> = <psi| S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3 |psi>.

We know that S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ², as before. So that part is 9/4 ħ².

Then, the other terms are 2 times the sum of dot products.

So, <psi|2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi> = 2 <psi| H |psi> / A.

Wait, because H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S1·S2 + ... = H/A.

Therefore, the expectation value of S_total^2 is 9/4 ħ² + 2*(<H>/A).

But wait, I can also express H in terms of S_total^2.

Earlier, I had H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²). Therefore, <H> = (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²).

So, substituting back, we have <H> = (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²). But also, the expectation value of S_total^2 is 9/4 ħ² + 2*(<H>/A).

So, let me set up the equation:

Let me denote <S_total^2> = S.

Then, S = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(<H>/A).

But <H> = (A/2)(S - 9/4 ħ²).

So, substituting S into the equation for <H>:

<H> = (A/2)(S - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(9/4 ħ² + 2*(<H>/A) - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(2*(<H>/A)) = (A/2)*(2 <H>/A) = <H>.

Hmm, this seems circular. So, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 directly. Let me try.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Thus, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We know that <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ², so their sum is 9/4 ħ².

Now, let's compute <S1·S2>. Recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2) <S1^x S2^x> + (1/2) <S1^y S2^y> + (1/2) <S1^z S2^z>.

Similarly for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>.

Let me compute each term.

First, let's compute <S1^z S2^z>.

In the state psi, which is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3), each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, for the term |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2. Similarly for the others.

So, <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] * S1^z S2^z * [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ] * (1/sqrt(3)).

So, for each term, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩, and similarly for the other terms. So, the matrix element is (1/4)(|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩).

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/4)(1/3)(1/1) = 1/12 ħ².

Wait, no. Wait, actually, since the expectation is (1/3) sum_{i,j} <i|S1^z S2^z|j>, where i and j run over the terms.

But more accurately, when S1^z S2^z acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it gives (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩, so (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩. Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, it gives (1/2)(-1/2)|↑↓↑⟩, which is (-1/4)|↑↓↑⟩, and for |↓↑↑⟩, it gives (-1/2)(1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)|↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, no, wait: S1^z acts on the first spin, S2^z on the second. So, in |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z gives +1/2, S2^z gives +1/2, so their product is +1/4. In |↑↓↑⟩, S1^z gives +1/2, S2^z gives -1/2, so their product is -1/4. Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, S1^z gives -1/2, S2^z gives +1/2, so their product is -1/4.

Therefore, the matrix elements are as follows:

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Similarly, the other terms:

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Same for <↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |...>

So, adding them all up:

The diagonal terms (i=j) give 1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4) = (1 -1 -1)/4 = -1/4.

Wait, no. Wait, each diagonal term is <i|S1^z S2^z|i> which, for each i, is (s_i1 * s_i2), where s_i1 is ±1/2 depending on the spin. Wait, no, in our case, for each term:

|↑↑↓> has s1=+1/2, s2=+1/2, so product +1/4.

|↑↓↑> has s1=+1/2, s2=-1/2, so product -1/4.

|↓↑↑> has s1=-1/2, s2=+1/2, so product -1/4.

Therefore, each diagonal term is as above. So, the total of the diagonal is 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

The off-diagonal terms are <i|S1^z S2^z|j> for i ≠ j. Each of these is the product of s_i1 * s_j2.

Looking at the different combinations:

From |↑↑↓> to |↑↓↑>: s1=+1/2, s2=-1/2: product -1/4.

From |↑↑↓> to |↓↑↑>: s1=-1/2, s2=+1/2: product -1/4.

From |↑↓↑> to |↓↑↑>: s1=-1/2, s2=+1/2: product -1/4.

Similarly, other transitions:

From |↑↓↑> to |↑↑↓>: s1=+1/2, s2=+1/2: product +1/4.

From |↑↓↑> to |↓↑↑>: s1=-1/2, s2=+1/2: product -1/4.

From |↓↑↑> to |↑↑↓>: s1=+1/2, s2=+1/2: product +1/4.

From |↓↑↑> to |↑↓↑>: s1=+1/2, s2=-1/2: product -1/4.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to compute the entire matrix and then find the trace.

Alternatively, perhaps note that since the state is symmetric, the expectation value might be easier.

Wait, actually, let me note that the state psi is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. Therefore, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is the same as S1^z S3^z and S2^z S3^z.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = <S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z> = same for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>.

Therefore, all three dot products have the same expectation value.

So, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = same value.

So, let me denote <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = E_pair.

So, 3 E_pair = <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = <H>/A.

Therefore, 3 E_pair = <H>/A.

Now, I need to compute E_pair. Let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

As above, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z>).

I already computed <S1^z S2^z> as follows.

From the earlier computation, the total of the diagonal terms is -1/4.

Wait, but actually, if I compute <S1^z S2^z>, it's equal to (1/3) sum_{i,j} <i| S1^z S2^z |j>.

Compute that:

When i=j:

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

<↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

So, sum of the diagonal terms: 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Now, the off-diagonal terms:

When i ≠ j:

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

<↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

<↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

<↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

<↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

So, summing these off-diagonal terms:

From ↑↑↓ to ↑↓↑: -1/4.

From ↑↑↓ to ↓↑↑: -1/4.

From ↑↓↑ to ↑↑↓: 1/4.

From ↑↓↑ to ↓↑↑: -1/4.

From ↓↑↑ to ↑↑↓: 1/4.

From ↓↑↑ to ↑↓↑: -1/4.

So, total off-diagonal terms: (-1/4 -1/4) + (1/4 -1/4) + (1/4 -1/4) = (-1/2) + (0) + (0) = -1/2.

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/3)[ (-1/4) + (-1/2) ] = (1/3)(-3/4) = -1/4.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/4) ħ².

Similarly, what about <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>?

Hmm, those terms are more complicated because S^x and S^y are operators, and their expectation values might not be straightforward.

Wait, but perhaps we can note that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S^x and S^y in the z-basis states can be computed.

In the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1^x and S2^x are acting on the first and second spins, which are both up. Similarly, the same goes for S1^y and S2^y.

But maybe it's better to compute the expectation value of S1^x S2^x.

Alternatively, since the state psi is symmetric under exchange, perhaps the expectation value of S1^x S2^x is zero? Because in the z-basis, which is not symmetric with respect to x and y, the expectation of S^x could be non-zero, but for symmetric states, perhaps some terms cancel out.

Wait, in fact, for the singlet state of two spins, the expectation value of S^x S^x is negative, but in our case, the state is a symmetric combination of three spins, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for any two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ²)/2.

Wait, because S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

Which gives S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²))/2 = (S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2.

Thus, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2.

So, if I can find the expectation of S_total^2, then I can find the expectation of S1·S2.

But since I don't yet know <S_total^2>, I can't directly compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the total spin in terms of the given state.

Wait, another approach: The given state psi is the same as the so-called "triplet" state for three spins, which is symmetric.

Wait, the triplet state for three spins would have S_total = 1/2, but I think that the triplet state is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1) ħ².

If the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then S_total^2 psi = S(S+1) ħ² psi.

So, in that case, the eigenvalue would be S(S+1) ħ², where S is the total spin.

But what is the total spin S for this state? Is it 0 or 1/2?

Wait, considering that it's a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, it's similar to a state with two spins up and one down. For two spins up and one spin down, the total spin could be 1/2 or 3/2. But for three
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). Hmm, okay, that looks like a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, but arranged in a specific way.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators S_i are given in terms of the Pauli matrices. Each S_i is (ℏ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_i for particle i. So, S1·S2 would be (ℏ²/4)(σ1·σ2), and similarly for the other terms. So, the Hamiltonian H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A ℏ²/4)(σ1·σ2 + σ1·σ3 + σ2·σ3).

Now, I remember that σ1·σ2 = 2P12 - 3I, where P12 is the swap operator between particles 1 and 2, and I is the identity matrix. Similarly for the other terms. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of total spin. Since we have three particles, the total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3. The Hamiltonian H can be written in terms of S·S. Let me compute H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)[(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Yes, that's a standard identity. So, H = (A/2)[S^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Since S1, S2, S3 are each spin-1/2 particles, S1^2 = (ℏ/2)^2 * I, and same for S2^2 and S3^2. So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = (3ℏ²/4)*I. Therefore,

H = (A/2)[S^2 - (3ℏ²/4) I].

So, H = (A ℏ²/2) [ (S^2)/(ℏ²) - 3/4 ].

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

H = (A/2) S^2 - (3A ℏ²/8) I.

But S^2 is the total spin squared. So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S^2 for the given state ψ, then I can compute the expectation value of H.

Given that ψ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total^2. Let me think about the total spin.

Wait, ψ is a combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. Let me write out ψ explicitly:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, each term is a permutation with two up and one down. Is this symmetric under permutation of the particles? It seems so, since it's a symmetric combination.

What's the total spin S^2 for such a state? Let's consider that.

If all three spins are up, then S^2 = (3ℏ/2)(3ℏ/2 + 1) = ( (3ℏ/2)(5/2) )? Wait, no. Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin could be either 3/2 or 1/2. If all spins are up, the total spin is 3/2.

In our case, ψ has two spins up and one spin down. Let me consider the possible total spin states for such a combination.

Wait, maybe ψ is part of a subspace with certain total spin. Let me consider the possible total spin states.

The possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can either be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

But in our case, ψ is in the S=1/2 subspace? Let me check.

Wait, if all three are up, that would be S=3/2. If two are up and one is down, depending on their configuration, the total spin could be either 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, actually, the state |↑↑↓⟩ can have total spin 1/2 or 3/2. How can I tell?

I think for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be either 3/2 or 1/2. The state ψ is a symmetric combination of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. Let me recall that for two spins up and one down, the symmetric state is part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, actually, the symmetric combination is unique for S=1/2. Because for three spin-1/2 particles, the S=1/2 states are unique symmetric states.

Wait, is that true? Let me think.

In three particles, the singlet state (S=0) is antisymmetric, and the triplets (S=1) are symmetric. But wait, with three fermions, the overall state must be antisymmetric. But in our case, we have spin states and not spatial states, so maybe it's different.

Wait, I might be confusing. Let me think again.

The total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. The S=3/2 states are the completely symmetric states, like |↑↑↑⟩, and others that can be reached by acting with spin flips.

The S=1/2 states are a four-dimensional representation? Wait, no, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 (which is five-dimensional) or 1/2 (which is four-dimensional). So ψ is in the S=1/2 subspace, because it's a symmetric combination of two up and one down.

Wait, but two up and one down could be both in the same S=1/2 multiplet or different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute S^2 for ψ.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ| S^2 |ψ⟩, because if S^2 has eigenvalues S(S+1)ℏ², then if ψ is in the S=1/2 subspace, the eigenvalue would be (1/2)(1/2 +1)ℏ² = (3/4)ℏ².

So, let's compute ⟨ψ| S^2 |ψ⟩.

But wait, S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, ⟨S^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But S1^2 = (3/4)ℏ², similarly for S2^2 and S3^2. So, ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ = 3*(3/4)ℏ² = 9/4 ℏ².

So, ⟨S^2⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But the Hamiltonian H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so ⟨H⟩ = A (⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Thus, ⟨S^2⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨H/A⟩, because H/A is exactly S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

So, 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨H/A⟩ = S(S+1)ℏ².

But wait, if I can compute ⟨S^2⟩, and also know that for ψ, since it's an eigenstate, we have S^2 |ψ⟩ = S(S+1)ℏ² |ψ⟩.

But wait, is ψ an eigenstate of S^2? If yes, then S^2 |ψ⟩ = S(S+1)ℏ² |ψ⟩.

So, if I can find whether ψ is an eigenstate of S^2, and if so, what is its eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨S^2⟩.

From the earlier expression:

⟨S^2⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨H/A⟩.

But we don't know ⟨H/A⟩ if ψ is not an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but the question is whether ψ is an eigenstate of H. If it's not, then we need to compute the expectation value ⟨H⟩.

But perhaps if I can compute ⟨S^2⟩, and knowing the possible eigenvalues of S^2, which for S=3/2 is (3/2)(5/2)ℏ² = 15/4 ℏ², and for S=1/2 is (1/2)(3/2)ℏ² = 3/4 ℏ².

So, if ψ is in the S=1/2 subspace, then ⟨S^2⟩ = 3/4 ℏ², so:

3/4 ℏ² = 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨H/A⟩.

So, solving for ⟨H/A⟩: 3/4 ℏ² - 9/4 ℏ² = 2⟨H/A⟩ => (-6/4)ℏ² = 2⟨H/A⟩ => ⟨H/A⟩ = (-6/4)ℏ² / 2 = (-3/4)ℏ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A * (-3/4) ℏ². But wait, that contradicts the given correct answer of 2/3 A ℏ².

So, perhaps my assumption that ψ is in the S=1/2 subspace is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe ψ is in the S=3/2 subspace. But wait, if ψ is symmetric under permutation, but |↑↑↑⟩ is also symmetric, so does that mean ψ is part of the S=3/2 subspace?

Wait, the S=3/2 subspace includes all symmetric states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the S=3/2 subspace has dimension 5, and the S=1/2 subspace has dimension 4.

Our state ψ is a symmetric combination of three basis states, so it must lie in the S=3/2 subspace. Therefore, S^2 |ψ⟩ = (15/4)ℏ² |ψ⟩.

Therefore, plugging into the earlier equation:

⟨S^2⟩ = 15/4 ℏ² = 9/4 ℏ² + 2⟨H/A⟩.

So, 15/4 ℏ² - 9/4 ℏ² = 6/4 ℏ² = 2⟨H/A⟩ => ⟨H/A⟩ = 6/4 ℏ² / 2 = 3/4 ℏ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A * (3/4) ℏ².

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ℏ².

Hmm, there must be something wrong here. Maybe my assumption that ψ is in S=3/2 subspace is incorrect.

Wait, but ψ is a symmetric state of two up and one down spins, which is different from |↑↑↑⟩.

Wait, perhaps ψ is not in the S=3/2 subspace. Maybe it's better to think in terms of individual spins.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute H acting on ψ directly.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, let me compute H applied to ψ. If Hψ is proportional to ψ, then it's an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 acting on ψ, and see if the combination is proportional to ψ.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's consider the action of each operator S_i·S_j.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/4)( (σ_i · σ_j) ) for spin-1/2. So, in terms of the Pauli matrices, S1·S2 = (ℏ²/4)( σ1 · σ2 ).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 in the state ψ.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩, similarly for the other terms.

First, the expectation value of S1·S2.

But S1·S2 = (ℏ²/4)( σ1 · σ2 ) = (ℏ²/4)( σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z ).

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ℏ²/4) [ ⟨↑↑↓ | σ1_x σ2_x | ↑↑↓ ⟩ + same for y and z, summed over all terms in ψ ].

Wait, actually, ψ is a sum of three basis states: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩. So, when we compute ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩, we need to expand ψ as a linear combination and compute the expectation value.

So, let me write ψ = (1/√3)(|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩), where |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, and |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Then, ψ† ψ = 1/3 (⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|)(|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩).

So, ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩ = (1/3)(⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|) S1·S2 (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩).

Now, compute each term:

⟨a | S1·S2 | a ⟩, ⟨a | S1·S2 | b ⟩, etc.

First, compute ⟨a | S1·S2 | a ⟩.

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩. So, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is ( (ℏ/2)^2 ) times ( |↑↓⟩⟨↑↓| + |↓↑⟩⟨↓↑| + ... wait, actually, S1·S2 acts on each spin.

Wait, S1·S2 is (ℏ²/4)( σ1·σ2 ). So, for |↑↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = |↑↓⟩⟨↑↓| + |↓↑⟩⟨↓↑| + I, where I is the identity matrix?

Wait, actually, σ1·σ2 = σ_x ⊗ σ_x + σ_y ⊗ σ_y + σ_z ⊗ σ_z.

So, acting σ_x ⊗ σ_x on |↑↑⟩ gives (σ_x |↑⟩ ) ⊗ (σ_x |↑⟩ ) = |↓⟩⊗|↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So, for |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = (σ_x |↑⟩σ_x |↑⟩ + σ_y |↑⟩σ_y |↑⟩ + σ_z |↑⟩ σ_z |↑⟩ ) = |↓↓⟩ + |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩ + 2|↓↓⟩.

But in our case, it's |↑↑↓⟩. So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ ) |↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(|↑↑⟩ + 2|↓↓⟩) |↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(|↑↑↓⟩ + 2|↓↓↓⟩ ).

But ⟨a | S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↑↑↓ | [ |↑↑↓⟩ + 2|↓↓↓⟩ ]) = (ℏ²/4)(1 + 0) = ℏ²/4.

Similarly, now compute ⟨a | S1·S2 |b⟩.

|b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

Compute σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩.

First, note that σ1 acts on the first spin, σ2 on the second. So, in |↑↓↑⟩, the first spin is up, second is down, third is up.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩ = σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩.

Compute σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩: σ1·σ2 |↑⟩ |↓⟩ = (σ_x |↑⟩ )⊗ (σ_x |↓⟩ ) + (σ_y |↑⟩ )⊗ (σ_y |↓⟩ ) + (σ_z |↑⟩ )⊗ (σ_z |↓⟩ ).

So,

σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩,

σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩,

σ_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩,

σ_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩,

σ_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩,

σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So,

σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ = (-1)|↑↑⟩,

σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = (-1)|↓↓⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑⟩ - |↓↓⟩.

Thus, σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (|↓↑⟩ - |↑↑⟩ - |↓↓⟩ ) |↑⟩.

Compute this:

|↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩,

|↑↑⟩ |↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩,

|↓↓⟩ |↑⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩).

Now, ⟨a | S1·S2 |b⟩ = (1/3)(⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c| ) (ℏ²/4)(|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩).

But ⟨a | is ⟨↑↑↓ |, so:

⟨a | S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↑↑↓ | (|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩ )).

Looking at each term:

⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0,

⟨↑↑↓ | ↑↑↑⟩ = 0 (since |↑↑↑⟩ has third spin up, but ⟨↑↑↓ | has third spin down),

⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↓↑⟩ = 0.

Therefore, ⟨a | S1·S2 |b⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨a | S1·S2 |c⟩. Let me compute that.

|c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Compute σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩ = σ1·σ2 |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩.

Compute σ1·σ2 |↓↑⟩:

Same as before, σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩,

σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = (-1)|↓↓⟩,

σ_z⊗σ_z |↓↑⟩ = (+1)|↑↑⟩.

Wait, no:

Wait, σ1·σ2 |↓↑⟩ = σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ + σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ + σ_z⊗σ_z |↓↑⟩.

From above, in the case of |↑↓⟩, σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

Similarly, σ_x⊗σ_x |↓↑⟩ = σ_x |↓⟩ ⊗ σ_x |↑⟩ = |↑⟩⊗|↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

σ_y⊗σ_y |↓↑⟩ = (σ_y |↓⟩ )⊗ (σ_y |↑⟩ ) = (-i|↑⟩ )⊗ (i|↓⟩ ) = -i^2 |↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

σ_z⊗σ_z |↓↑⟩ = (σ_z |↓⟩ )⊗ (σ_z |↑⟩ ) = (-1)|↓⟩⊗ |↑⟩ = -|↓↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩ + |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ = (2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩).

Hence, σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (2|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) |↑⟩.

Which is 2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩).

Now, ⟨a | S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2⟨↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑⟩ ).

Compute each term:

⟨↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0,

⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Thus, ⟨a | S1·S2 |c⟩ = 0.

Similarly, now compute ⟨b | S1·S2 |a⟩.

From earlier, S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + 2|↓↓↓⟩.

So, ⟨b | S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↑↓ ⟩ + 2⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↓↓ ⟩ ).

⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↑↓ ⟩ = 0,

⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0,

Thus, ⟨b | S1·S2 |a⟩ = 0.

Next, ⟨b | S1·S2 |b⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩ ).

So, ⟨b | S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↑↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↓↑⟩ ).

Compute each term:

⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = δ_{↑, ↓} δ_{↓, ↑} δ_{↑, ↑} = 0,

⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↑↑⟩ = δ_{↓, ↑} δ_{↑, ↑} δ_{↑, ↑} = 0,

⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↓↑⟩ = δ_{↑, ↓} δ_{↓, ↓} δ_{↑, ↑} = 0,

So, ⟨b | S1·S2 |b⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨b | S1·S2 |c⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩).

Thus, ⟨b | S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ ).

Which is (ℏ²/4)(2*1 - 0) = ℏ²/2.

Wait, hold on, ⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ is 1, right?

Wait, no, ⟨b | is ⟨↑↓↑ |, so yes, 2⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ is 2*1=2, and ⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ is 0.

Therefore, ⟨b | S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2 - 0) = ℏ²/2.

Similarly, continue.

Next, compute ⟨c | S1·S2 |a⟩.

S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + 2|↓↓↓⟩.

⟨c | is ⟨↓↑↑ |. So,

⟨c | S1·S2 |a⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↓↑↑ | ↑↑↓ ⟩ + 2⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↓↓ ⟩ ).

But ⟨↓↑↑ | ↑↑↓ ⟩ = 0,

⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0,

Thus, ⟨c | S1·S2 |a⟩ = 0.

Next, ⟨c | S1·S2 |b⟩ = same as ⟨b | S1·S2 |c⟩, which was ℏ²/2.

Wait, no, ⟨c | S1·S2 |b⟩, compute that.

Wait, S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(|↓↑↑⟩ - |↑↑↑⟩ - |↓↓↑⟩ ).

So, ⟨c | S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ - ⟨↓↑↑ | ↑↑↑⟩ - ⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↓↑⟩ ).

Compute each term:

⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 1,

⟨↓↑↑ | ↑↑↑⟩ = 0,

⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↓↑⟩ = 0.

Thus, ⟨c | S1·S2 |b⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(1 - 0 - 0) = ℏ²/4.

Next, ⟨c | S1·S2 |c⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩),

So, ⟨c | S1·S2 |c⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(2⟨↓↑↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ - ⟨↓↑↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ ).

Which is (ℏ²/4)(0 - 1) = -ℏ²/4.

Okay, so compiling all the terms for ⟨ψ | S1·S2 |ψ⟩:

It is (1/3)[ ⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c| ] S1·S2 [ |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ ].

From earlier computations:

⟨a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = ℏ²/4,

⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ = 0,

⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩ = 0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩ = 0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |b⟩ = 0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩ = ℏ²/2,

⟨c| S1·S2 |a⟩ = 0,

⟨c| S1·S2 |b⟩ = ℏ²/4,

⟨c| S1·S2 |c⟩ = -ℏ²/4.

So, sum all these contributions:

(1/3)[ (ℏ²/4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + ℏ²/2 + 0 + ℏ²/4 + (-ℏ²/4) ]

Simplify:

(1/3)[ (ℏ²/4) + (ℏ²/2) + (ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4) ]

The last two terms cancel: ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4 = 0.

So, remaining: (ℏ²/4) + (ℏ²/2) = (ℏ²/4 + 2ℏ²/4) = 3ℏ²/4.

Therefore, (1/3)(3ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/4.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ℏ²/4.

Similarly, by symmetry, ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩ should be the same. Let me check for ⟨S1·S3⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute one more term to confirm.

Compute ⟨ψ | S1·S3 | ψ ⟩.

Following similar steps as above. But this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps since the state is symmetric in all three particles, the expectation values ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩ are all equal.

If that's the case, then since we found ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ℏ²/4, then each of the three terms would be ℏ²/4, so total ⟨H⟩ = A*(ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 ) = (3A ℏ²)/4.

But wait, earlier when I tried to think in terms of S², I thought that ⟨S²⟩ = 15/4 ℏ², so 9/4 + 2*(3A ℏ²)/4 = 15/4 ℏ².

Wait, hold on: Wait, if ⟨H⟩ = (3A/4)ℏ², then 2⟨H/A⟩ = (3/2)ℏ².

So, ⟨S²⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2*(3/4 A ℏ²) = 9/4 ℏ² + (3/2)ℏ² = (9/4 + 6/4) ℏ² = 15/4 ℏ², which matches S=3/2 (since S(S+1)=15/4 for S=3/2).

Thus, this is consistent.

But according to the correct answer, it should be 2/3 A ℏ².

Hmm, this is a discrepancy. So, either I'm making a mistake, or the correct answer is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value of S1·S2.

Wait, let me double-check.

From the earlier computation:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ℏ²/4) [ sum over all terms ].

Wait, when I computed ⟨ψ | S1·S2 | ψ ⟩, I got ℏ²/4. But I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, to be precise, let's compute all the contributions again.

So, the cross terms:

⟨a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = ℏ²/4,

⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩=0,

⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩=0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩=0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |b⟩=0,

⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩= ℏ²/2,

⟨c| S1·S2 |a⟩=0,

⟨c| S1·S2 |b⟩= ℏ²/4,

⟨c| S1·S2 |c⟩= -ℏ²/4.

Thus, adding all these:

ℏ²/4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + ℏ²/2 + 0 + ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4.

So,

ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/2 + (ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4) =

ℏ²/4 + 2ℏ²/4 + 0 =

3ℏ²/4.

Then, multiplied by 1/3 gives ℏ²/4. So, yes, indeed, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ℏ²/4.

So, if all three terms are ℏ²/4 each, then ⟨H⟩ = A*(3*(ℏ²/4)) = (3A ℏ²)/4.

Alternatively, maybe I was wrong about ψ being in the S=3/2 subspace, but if ⟨S^2⟩ = 15/4 ℏ², then S=3/2.

So, the eigenvalue of H would be A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(3*(ℏ²/4)) = (3A/4)ℏ².

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ℏ², so this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of S1·S2.

Alternatively, perhaps H is written differently. Wait, let me recall that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But in the standard notation, sometimes the total spin is considered, but in this case, it's a combination of pairwise interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2.

So, H = (A/2)[S^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Since S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are each (ℏ/2)^2, so (3ℏ²/4).

Thus, H = (A/2)(S^2 - 3ℏ²/4).

But since ψ is an eigenstate of S^2, with eigenvalue S(S+1)ℏ².

Earlier, we found S=3/2, so S(S+1) = 15/4.

Therefore, Hψ = (A/2)( (15/4 ℏ² ) - 3ℏ²/4 ) ψ = (A/2)(12/4 ℏ² ) ψ = (A/2)(3ℏ²) ψ = (3A/2) ℏ² ψ.

Wait, but that contradicts earlier result where ⟨H⟩ was 3A/4 ℏ².

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, probably this is correct.

Wait, no, because if ψ is an eigenstate of S^2 with eigenvalue 15/4 ℏ², then Hψ = (A/2)(15/4 ℏ² - 3/4 ℏ²)ψ = (A/2)(12/4 ℏ²)ψ = (3A/2) ℏ² ψ.

But according to our earlier computation, the expectation value was (3
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↓⟩|↑⟩ + |↑⟩|↓↑⟩ + |↓⟩|↑↑⟩ ). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, or not, and if it is, what the energy is; if not, what the expectation value is.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall some properties of spin operators. Since these are spin-1/2 particles, each Si is a vector operator with components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. The dot product S_i·S_j is the sum of the products of their respective components: S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z. So H is A times the sum of these dot products for all three pairs.

Given that, maybe it's helpful to compute each S_i·S_j term separately and then add them up.

But before that, let's think about the state psi. It's given as 1/sqrt(3) times a sum of three terms. Each term is a product of two up spins and one down spin. Let me write out the terms:

1. |↑↓⟩|↑⟩
2. |↑⟩|↓↑⟩
3. |↓⟩|↑↑⟩

So each term is a two-up, one-down configuration, but arranged such that each term has one down spin in a different position. So the first term has the third particle down, the second has the second particle down, and the third has the first particle down.

Is this state symmetric under permutations of the particles? It seems so because swapping particles would just permute the terms in the sum. So psi is symmetric under the exchange of any two particles.

Wait, each term in psi is a product state where exactly two spins are up and one is down. So the total spin state is a combination of these.

But to check if psi is an eigenfunction of H, I need to compute H|psi⟩ and see if it's proportional to |psi⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of H in terms of total spin operators. Let me recall that S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. The square of the total spin is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So from this, we can solve for the sum of S_i·S_j:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ).

Each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2 particles.

So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Thus, S_total² = H + (9/4)ħ².

Wait, no. Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ). Therefore,

H = (A/2)*(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

So H = (A/2) S_total² - (A/2)*(9/4)ħ² = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ².

So, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ².

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are determined by the eigenvalues of S_total².

So, the eigenvalues of S_total² are S(S+1)ħ², where S is the total spin quantum number.

Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are E = (A/2) S(S+1)ħ² - (9/8) A ħ².

So, to find whether psi is an eigenfunction, I need to find the total spin S of this state.

So, let's compute the total spin S for state psi.

Given that psi is symmetric under permutations, maybe it's a symmetric spin state. Let me try to determine its total spin.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. Let me think about the total spin of each term.

Let me compute the total spin squared for each term.

Each term is a product state of two up and one down spin.

Let me denote |s1⟩ = |↑⟩, |s2⟩ = |↑⟩, |s3⟩ = |↓⟩.

Then the first term is |s1⟩|s2⟩|s3⟩.

The spin operator S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

For each term, the total spin is the combination of the individual spins.

For each term, since each term is a product state, the total spin squared operator acting on it can be computed as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

But maybe it's easier to consider that for a product state, the expectation value of S_total² is the sum of the individual expectations.

Wait, no. Because S_total is the sum of the individual spins, so S_total² is the sum of the squares plus the sum of the cross terms.

Therefore, for a given product state, the expectation value of S_total² is the sum of the individual S_i² (each being (3/4)ħ²) plus twice the sum of the expectations of S_i·S_j.

But each term in psi is a product of two up and one down, so let's compute ⟨S_total²⟩ for a single term, say |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute ⟨↑↑↓| S_total² |↑↑↓⟩.

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, for |↑↑↓⟩, we have S1 = S2 = 1/2 ħ, S3 = -1/2 ħ.

So, S_total² = ( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ) ħ² + 2*( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ).

Compute S1·S2: since both are up, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Similarly, S1·S3: S1 is up, S3 is down. So S1·S3 = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

Similarly, S2·S3 = (-1/4)ħ².

Therefore, S_total² = ( (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) ) ħ² + 2*( (3/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ) ħ².

Compute:

First term: (3/4) ħ².

Second term: 2*( (3/4 - 1/4 -1/4 ) ) ħ² = 2*(1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So total S_total² = (3/4 + 1/2) ħ² = (5/4) ħ².

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me verify:

Each S1, S2, S3 squared: (1/2)^2, (1/2)^2, (-1/2)^2.

So sum of squares: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4, correct.

Now the cross terms:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4.

S1·S3 = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Similarly, S2·S3 = -1/4.

So sum of cross terms: 3/4 -1/4 -1/4 = 1/4.

Multiply by 2: 2*(1/4) = 1/2.

Hence, total S_total² = 3/4 + 1/2 = 5/4. So 5/4 ħ².

Therefore, for each term |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, the expectation value of S_total² is 5/4 ħ².

Therefore, when we take the state psi, which is a symmetric combination of these three terms, the expectation value of S_total² would be the same.

So, since each term has expectation 5/4, and the state is symmetric, the total expectation is 5/4 ħ².

Therefore, S_total² |psi⟩ = (5/4) ħ² |psi⟩.

Therefore, the eigenvalue for S_total² is 5/4 ħ², so S(S+1) = 5/4.

Wait, that can't be because S must be an integer or half-integer. 5/4 is not an integer. Hmm, that seems odd.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the expectation value.

Wait, no, because S_total² can have eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ², but in this case, perhaps the state isn't a singlet or triplet state, so it might not be a multiple of a single S_total.

Wait, but wait, when the state is symmetric under permutation, which psi is, that suggests it's in a symmetric spin state.

Wait, another approach: maybe compute the total spin by considering the possible spin states.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

Wait, so for S = 3/2, the maximum, the state would have all spins up, which isn't the case here.

For S = 1/2, the possible states are combinations that lead to total spin 1/2.

But our state psi has two up and one down in all possible positions.

Wait, let me think about this differently.

Each term is a product state with two up and one down.

Each such term has a total spin of either 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, for a product state |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin is 1/2, because adding two up spins (each 1/2) gives total spin 1, then adding the down spin (which is -1/2), so 1 + (-1/2) = 1/2.

Similarly, adding the spins 1/2 and 1/2 gives spin 1, plus (-1/2) gives 1/2. So yes, that's correct.

So each term is a state with total spin 1/2.

So then, S_total² acting on each term gives (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But earlier, I computed that for |↑↑↓⟩, S_total² = 5/4 ħ², which contradicts this.

Wait, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, no. S_total² is the sum of S1 + S2 + S3 squared.

Wait, for a state with two spins up (which contribute 1/2 each) and one spin down (-1/2), the total spin is 1/2, as I said.

So S_total² = (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But when I computed it explicitly, I got 5/4 ħ². So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation of S_total² for the state |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Compute S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 for |↑↑↓⟩.

Each spin is represented as vectors, so S1, S2 are up, S3 is down.

Expressed in terms of matrices, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( (σ_i · σ_j ) ) where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So for |↑↑↓⟩, each S_i^z is 1/2, except S3 is -1/2.

Compute each term:

Compute S1²: (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly S2² = 3/4 ħ².

S3² = 3/4 ħ².

Compute S1·S2: (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Wait, but no, S1·S2 is calculated as the sum of their components.

Wait, perhaps instead, for spin 1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( (σ_i · σ_j ) ).

Wait, but for the state |↑↑↓⟩, what is S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

Each S_i·S_j is (1/2)( (σ_i · σ_j ) ) evaluated on that state.

So, σ_i · σ_j is 3 when spins are up, because σ_i · σ_j = 3 for parallel spins, and -1 for antiparallel spins.

Wait, no, wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, σ_i · σ_j = 3 when both are up, or both are down; and -1 when opposite.

So for |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 = 3.

For |↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = -1.

Similarly, for |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩, same.

So, for |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (σ1 · σ2 ) ) = (1/2)(3) = 3/4.

Similarly, S1·S3 for |↑↑↓⟩ is |↑⟩|↓⟩: since they're opposite, so (σ1 · σ3) = -1, so S1·S3 = (1/2)(-1) = -1/2.

Similarly, S2·S3 = -1/2.

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = 3/4 - 1/2 -1/2 = 3/4 -1 = -1/4.

Therefore, S_total² = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2*(-1/4)ħ².

Wait, no: S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So,

S1² = (3/4) ħ²,

S2² = (3/4) ħ²,

S3² = (3/4) ħ²,

Sum: 9/4 ħ².

2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = 2*(-1/4) ħ² = -1/2 ħ².

Therefore, S_total² = 9/4 ħ² -1/2 ħ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² = 7/4 ħ².

Wait, so S_total² = 7/4 ħ².

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that the total spin is 1/2. Because S(S+1) = 7/4 would imply S is sqrt(7)/2, which is not a possible spin for three spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_total² in the state |↑↑↓⟩.

But no, if |↑↑↓⟩ has total spin 1/2, then S_total² should be 3/4 ħ², but my calculation shows 7/4 ħ².

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express S_total² in terms of the sum of the individual spins.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. But let's see.

Wait, for |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value of S_total² is 7/4 ħ². So that suggests that the state |↑↑↓⟩ is not a spin 1/2 state, which contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is considering that adding two spins 1/2 and a third spin 1/2.

Wait, adding spins: Let's think of it as (S1 + S2 + S3). So S1 and S2 are each 1/2, S3 is -1/2.

So, S1 + S2 = (1/2 +1/2) = 1, so S_total = 1 + (-1/2) = 1/2.

Therefore, S_total² = (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But why does the explicit calculation give 7/4 ħ²?

Hmm, maybe because I miscalculated.

Wait, no, wait, let me think again.

Each S_i^z is 1/2, 1/2, -1/2.

So, S_total^z is 1/2 +1/2 -1/2 = 1/2.

But S_total squared is not just (1/2)^2, but also includes the other components.

Wait, but in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin is 1/2, so maybe the expectation value is 3/4.

But when I computed it explicitly, I got 7/4. There must be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me do it again.

Compute S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

= S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Compute each term:

S1² = (3/4) ħ²,

S2² = (3/4) ħ²,

S3² = (3/4) ħ²,

Sum: 9/4 ħ².

Compute 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3):

As above, S1·S2 = 3/4 ħ²,

S1·S3 = -1/2 ħ²,

S2·S3 = -1/2 ħ²,

So 2*(3/4 -1/2 -1/2) = 2*(-1/4) = -1/2.

Thus, S_total² = 9/4 -1/2 = 9/4 - 2/4 = 7/4.

So, 7/4 ħ².

But wait, if the state |↑↑↓⟩ is a total spin state of 1/2, then S_total² should be (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But according to this, it's 7/4.

So, there must be a miscalculation in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in treating S1·S2 as (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) ħ² = 3/4 ħ², but actually, S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z), which for |↑↑⟩ is 3/4 ħ², because each component product gives (1/2)(1/2)ħ² for each direction, so 3*(1/2)^2 ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Similarly, S1·S3 for |↑↓⟩ is (1/2)(-1/2) ħ² for each component, so (-1/2)ħ².

Wait, so yes, S1·S2 = 3/4, S1·S3 = -1/2, S2·S3 = -1/2.

So sum is 3/4 -1/2 -1/2 = 3/4 -1 = -1/4.

Therefore, 2*(sum) = -1/2.

So S_total² = 9/4 -1/2 = 7/4. So 7/4 ħ².

But if the state is |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin is 1/2, so S_total² should be 3/4.

What is the discrepancy here?

Wait, perhaps the state |↑↑↓⟩ isn't an eigenstate of S_total².

In other words, although it's a product state, it's not a simultaneous eigenstate of all S_i^z, so S_total² doesn't act on it to give 3/4 ħ².

Wait, but in fact, S_total² is a Casimir operator, so it should have eigenvalues for states with definite total spin.

But if the state isn't an eigenstate of S_total², then its expectation value is 7/4 ħ², not 3/4.

But that contradicts the idea that |↑↑↓⟩ is a spin 1/2 state.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that |↑↑↓⟩ isn't a singlet or a triplet state.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet is |↓↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩, and the triplets are symmetric states like |↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), and |↓↓⟩.

But for three particles, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the state |↑↑↓⟩ is part of a higher multiplet.

But I thought that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Each state is a combination of different couplings.

But |↑↑↓⟩ is symmetric under permutation, so it's part of the S=1/2 symmetric subspace.

Wait, let me check that.

Wait, the symmetric states for three spin-1/2 particles are those which are invariant under swapping any two particles.

Our state psi is symmetric, so it's in the symmetric subspace.

The symmetric spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2.

The dimension of the symmetric subspace is 3, since the total symmetric states are the symmetric combinations, and for three particles, the symmetric subspace has dimension (3 +1)/2 = 2, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, actually, the spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can be expressed in terms of symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces.

The total Hilbert space has dimension 2^3 = 8.

The symmetric subspace is of dimension 4, and antisymmetric is 4.

But for spin states, the symmetric subspace corresponds to spin states with S=3/2 (dimension 5) and S=1/2 (dimension 3). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the symmetric spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can have S=3/2, which has dimension 5 (since 2S +1 =5), and S=1/2, which has dimension 3, but 5 +3=8 which is the total dimension.

Wait, but 5 +3=8, yes.

But wait, actually, the spin multiplets for three spin-1/2 particles are more complicated because of the possible couplings. The possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

The S=3/2 multiplet has dimension 5 and S=1/2 has dimension 3.

But how does this fit into the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces?

The symmetric subspace has dimension 4 (since from 8, symmetric is (8 +0)/2=4? No, wait, actually, the symmetric subspace has dimension (8 + trace)/2, which would be 4.

But in terms of spin, the S=3/2 has 5 dimensions, which is more than 4, so perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Actually, the symmetric space is 4-dimensional, and the spin states in it are combinations of different multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the symmetric subspace contains the S=3/2 and S=1/2 representations.

But S=3/2 is 5-dimensional, which doesn't fit into 4.

Therefore, perhaps the symmetric subspace only contains the S=1/2 representation.

Wait, that can't be because then how do you get 4 dimensions.

Wait, the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, as per the symmetry under permutation.

The S=3/2 multiplet is 5-dimensional, which is odd, so it must transform under the antisymmetric subspace.

Wait, perhaps the symmetric subspace only contains the S=1/2 multiplet, which is 3-dimensional, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the multiplets decompose under the symmetric group.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be found by combining two spins into S12 and then combining with the third.

But this can lead to a more complex decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the possible states.

Our state psi is symmetric and has two up spins and one down spin. How many such states are there?

There are C(3,1) = 3, which matches the three terms in psi.

Each term is a different placement of the down spin.

So, the symmetric subspace contains all states with two up and one down spin, which are 3 states, and the fully symmetric state with all up spins, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, no, the fully symmetric state would have all spins up, but that's not in our case.

Wait, perhaps the symmetric subspace includes all symmetric states, including those with certain numbers of up and down spins.

But in our case, psi is a symmetric combination of three specific states, each with two up and one down.

Therefore, perhaps the symmetric subspace includes these three states as well as other symmetric states.

Wait, maybe the symmetric subspace for three spin-1/2 particles includes the totally symmetric spin states, which include all possible numbers of up spins, but arranged symmetrically.

Wait, but in terms of spin, the symmetric subspace must have dimension 4, as mentioned before.

But our state is 3-dimensional, but in a 4-dimensional space.

Wait, perhaps our state psi is not in the entire symmetric subspace but is part of it.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me step back.

Given that the problem says that the correct answer is that psi is an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue (2/3)A ħ².

So, perhaps I should try to compute H|psi⟩ and see if it's proportional to |psi⟩.

Alternatively, since we have H expressed in terms of S_total², which is (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²).

So, if I can compute S_total² |psi⟩, then H|psi⟩ = (A/2)(S_total² -9/4 ħ²)|psi⟩.

So, if |psi⟩ is an eigenstate of S_total², then H|psi⟩ is proportional to |psi⟩.

So, let's compute S_total² |psi⟩.

But first, perhaps I can find the expectation value of S_total² in |psi⟩.

Given that |psi⟩ is a symmetric combination of three states, each with two up and one down.

Each |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ has S_total² expectation value of 7/4 ħ² as computed earlier.

But wait, that can't be, because if the state is symmetric, and each term in the sum has the same expectation, then the total expectation is 7/4 ħ².

But if |psi⟩ is an eigenstate of S_total², then the expectation value is an eigenvalue, which would have to be the same across all terms.

But if each term has S_total² =7/4 ħ², then the expectation of |psi⟩ is 7/4 ħ².

But then, S_total² |psi⟩ = (7/4 ħ²)|psi⟩.

Thus, plugging into H:

H = (A/2)(S_total² -9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(7/4 ħ² -9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)( -2/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)( -1/2 ħ² ) = -A/4 ħ².

Wait, but the correct answer says the energy is 2/3 A ħ². So perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the expectation value of S_total² is different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation of S_total² for |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps let me compute S_total² acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Since S1, S2, S3 are spin matrices, their action on |↑↑↓⟩ can be represented as follows.

Each S_i^z |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2) |↑↑↓⟩, except S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2) |↑↑↓⟩.

But S_total² includes not just S^z, but also S^x and S^y.

Therefore, it's not as straightforward as just computing the z-component.

However, for spin 1/2 particles, we can use the fact that S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ², and also that S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_k^2) where k is the third particle.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that S_i · S_j = (1/2)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ).

But perhaps it's better to consider that for a product state, the expectation value of S_total² can be found as:

⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨ψ| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |ψ⟩

= ⟨ψ| (S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) |ψ⟩

= ⟨ψ| (3*(3/4) ħ²) |ψ⟩ + 2⟨ψ| (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |ψ⟩

So, 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

So, compute ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

Each term S1·S2 is the same for each term in the sum, as the state is symmetric.

Wait, because the state is symmetric, the expectation of S1·S2 is the same as S1·S3, etc.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

For each term in |psi⟩, which is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, compute ⟨↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩, etc.

As before, S1·S2 for |↑↑↓⟩ is 3/4 ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S2 is (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) (ħ²) = 3/4.

Wait, no, wait: S1·S2 is still the same because it's the dot product of the first two spins.

Wait, no, S1·S2 is the same operator regardless of the third spin.

So, for any term in |psi⟩, the expectation of S1·S2 is the same.

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

So, since |psi⟩ is symmetric, each ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, ⟨S2·S3⟩ is the same.

So, let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for a single term, say |↑↑↓⟩.

Earlier, I found that ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 3/4 ħ².

Similarly, ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = (-1/2) ħ².

Wait, but when I compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for |↑↑↓⟩, I get 3/4 ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, ⟨S1·S2⟩ is also 3/4 ħ², because the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, which have a dot product S1·S2 = 3/4 ħ², because they're in a triplet state.

Wait, no, S1·S2 is (1/2)( (σ1·σ2) ) acting on |↑↓⟩.

For |↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = -1, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(-1) ħ² = -1/2 ħ².

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S1·S2 is (1/2)( (σ1·σ2) ) * ħ².

So, for |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 = 3, so S1·S2 = 3/2 ħ²? No, wait, no.

Wait, S1·S2 = ( (S1^x S2^x ) + (S1^y S2^y ) + (S1^z S2^z ) )

Each component is (1/2)(1/2 +1 ) for the same spin?

Wait, no, S1^z S2^z for |↑↑⟩ is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y acting on |↑↑⟩ give ( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = 1/2 each, but wait, no.

Wait, S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = ( (1/2)(1/2) ) |↑↑⟩ = 1/4 |↑↑⟩.

Similarly for S1^y S2^y.

So S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/4 +1/4 +1/4) ħ² |↑↑⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Similarly, for |↑↓⟩, S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = ( (1/4)(-1/4) + (1/4)(-1/4) + (1/4)(-1/4) ) ħ² |↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, S1^z S2^z |↑↓⟩
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I need to figure out if the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). 

First, I recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed using the identity S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_i^2 · S_j^2). Wait, no, actually, the correct identity is S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2). Hmm, maybe I should write it as S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - [S_i + S_j]^2). 

But another thought: for spin-1/2 particles, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S_i·S_j can be written as (1/2)[(3/4)ħ² + (3/4)ħ² - (S_i + S_j)^2]. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me step back.

I remember that for two spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of S_i·S_j can be found. The operator S_i·S_j has eigenvalues ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) + (1/2)(1/2 + 1) - (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) )? Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, for two particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_i^2 · S_j^2). No, that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, I think for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S = S1 + S2, and S^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. So, if I solve for S1·S2, I get S1·S2 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. That seems correct.

Given that S1 and S2 are each spin-1/2, their squares are (3/4)ħ² each. So S1·S2 = (S^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2. The eigenvalues of S^2 for two spin-1/2 particles are 0 (singlet) and 2ħ² (triplet). So, for the singlet state, S^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = (0 - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = -3/4 ħ². For the triplet states, S^2 = 2ħ², so S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = (1/2 ħ²)/2 = 1/4 ħ².

So, going back to the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So each term like S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 has eigenvalues depending on the state. For example, in the triplet state, each S_i·S_j would have eigenvalue (1/4)ħ², but wait, no. Wait, for a single pair, if the two are in a triplet, their S_i·S_j is 1/4 ħ². If they are in a singlet, it's -3/4 ħ². So, for three particles, we need to compute the sum.

But in our given state, the spin configuration is such that each pair has one up and two downs? Wait, let me look at psi again.

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). So in each term, two spins are up and one is down. Wait, no, in each term, exactly two are up and one is down? Wait, no, in each term, each term is three spins, with two ups and one down. But which particle is down varies.

So, for example, in the first term, particle 3 is down, particles 1 and 2 are up. Second term, particle 2 is down, particles 1 and 3 are up. Third term, particle 1 is down, particles 2 and 3 are up.

So each term has two spins up and one spin down, but arranged differently.

But is this a symmetric state? Well, the coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), so it's a symmetric combination. Let me think.

Since each term is a product of two ups and one down, but with different positions, the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles. So it should be an eigenfunction of the permutation group. Therefore, it's a symmetric spin state.

Now, we need to compute the expectation value of H in this state. Alternatively, if the state is an eigenstate of H, we can compute its eigenvalue.

But first, to check if it's an eigenstate, maybe we can look at the action of H on psi. If H psi is proportional to psi, then it's an eigenstate.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H.

Let me proceed step by step.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so we can write H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We can compute each term separately. Given that all three terms are similar, maybe the expectation value for each term is the same, so we can compute one and multiply by 3.

But let's try to compute, for example, <S1·S2>.

To compute <S1·S2>, we can recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2). Then, since S1 and S2 are spin-1/2, S1^2 = S2^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (3/4)ħ² + (3/4)ħ² - (S_total^2) ). So S1·S2 = (3/4 ħ² - (S_total^2)/2 ).

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (3/4 ħ² - (1/2)<S_total^2>).

So, what is <S_total^2> for the given state?

Wait, in the given state, psi, we have two spins up and one spin down in each term. Wait, but the state is symmetric. Maybe we can express it in terms of total spin states.

But perhaps it's better to compute <S_total^2> in the state psi. S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if we can compute <S_total^2>, we can find the expectation value of H.

Alternatively, since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Wait, no.

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, solving for (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) gives:

(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2).

Now, if we can compute <H>, it's equal to (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 3*(3/4 ħ²)), since S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 each are (3/4)ħ².

So, <H> = (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²).

So, to find <H>, we need to find <S_total^2>. Let me compute that.

Given the state psi, which is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). Let me write this as a linear combination of product states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the total spin S^2 eigenvalue for this state.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, maybe it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, is the state symmetric? It's symmetric under permutation of the spins because each term is a different permutation with two ups and one down. So yes, the state is symmetric, so it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, but what is the eigenvalue? Let's see.

The total spin can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). Since this is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, perhaps it's a triplet state. Wait, let me check.

But wait, the singlet state is antisymmetric, so this symmetric state must be a triplet.

So, if the total spin S is 1, then S_total^2 = S(S + 1) ħ² = 2 ħ².

Alternatively, if the state is a singlet, S_total^2 = 0. But since the state is symmetric, it can't be a singlet, so it must be a triplet state with S = 1, so S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

Wait, but let's confirm.

But the state, psi, is not the usual triplet state. The usual triplet states are symmetric and have two spins up and one spin down or all three spins up.

But psi is a symmetric combination of states with two ups and one down, each with a different particle in the down position.

Wait, so the usual triplet state with two up and one down is something like (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). Which is exactly psi.

Therefore, yes, this is one of the triplet states with total spin S = 1.

Hence, S_total^2 for this state is 2 ħ².

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 2 ħ².

So, going back, <H> = (A/2)(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(5/4 ħ²) = (5/8) A ħ².

Wait, but the expected answer is 2/3 A ħ². So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that the state is a triplet is wrong? Or perhaps my calculation of <S_total^2> is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again.

If the state psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, each term with a different spin down, then it's a symmetric state with S=1. So S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

So, in that case, <S_total^2> = 2 ħ².

But according to the expected answer, the energy is 2/3 A ħ², so the expectation value of H would be (A/2)(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(5/4 ħ²) = (5/8) A ħ², which is different from 2/3 A ħ².

So either my calculation is wrong, or I misunderstood the state.

Wait, maybe my value for S_total^2 is incorrect.

Wait, let's calculate <S_total^2> directly.

Given that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We already know that S1^2 = 3/4 ħ² for each particle, so <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

But wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

But from S_total^2, we have that <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

So, substituting into <H>, we have <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>) = A*(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

But wait, that would just bring us back to <H> = (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ²). So, we have <H> in terms of <S_total^2>, which we thought was 2 ħ².

But if that's the case, then <H> = (A/2)(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(5/4 ħ²) = (5/8) A ħ², which is 0.625 A ħ².

But the expected answer is 2/3 A ħ², which is approximately 0.666 A ħ². So, something is not matching here.

Alternatively, perhaps my assumption that S_total^2 = 2 ħ² is wrong. Maybe the state is not a triplet.

Wait, let's check whether the state is a triplet or not.

Wait, the state psi is given as (up up down + up down up + down up up)/sqrt(3). Let me write this as a linear combination.

Let me denote the basis states as |1,2,3> where each position is up or down. But perhaps it's better to work in the basis of two up and one down.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express this state in terms of total spin states.

Wait, the triplet states with S=1 can be expressed as:

|1,1> = |up up up>

|1,0> = (|up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>)/sqrt(3)

|1,-1> = |down down up>

Wait, so our state psi is exactly |1,0>, which is a triplet state with S=1, M=0.

Therefore, S_total^2 = 2 ħ² as before.

Wait, so that seems consistent. So if S_total^2 is 2 ħ², then <S_total^2> is 2 ħ², which would give <H> = (A/2)(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(5/4 ħ²) = (5/8) A ħ².

But the expected answer is 2/3 A ħ², so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the value of S_total^2 is not 2 ħ². Wait, S_total^2 for spin 1 is indeed 2 ħ², since S(S+1) = 1*2 = 2.

But let me compute <S_total^2> directly.

Given that psi is |1,0>, which is (up up down + up down up + down up up)/sqrt(3), let's compute <S_total^2>.

But wait, S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Let me compute the expectation value of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 in the state psi.

Expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We know that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ² for each particle.

So, <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, for the cross terms, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, let's compute <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3>.

Each of these terms can be evaluated as follows:

For any two spins, say S1 and S2, the operator S1·S2 has eigenvalues as we discussed before: for singlet (0), it's -3/4 ħ², and for triplet (1), it's 1/4 ħ².

But in our state psi, which is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, we can think of it as a triplet state.

Wait, in the state |1,0>, which is our psi, the total spin is 1, so the eigenvalue for each S_i·S_j would be the same.

But actually, that's not necessarily true. Each pair S_i·S_j might have the same expectation value, but in the triplet state, each pair S_i·S_j has expectation value (1/4) ħ²? Wait, no.

Wait, earlier, I thought that for two spins in a triplet state, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/4) ħ², and in a singlet, it's (-3/4) ħ².

But in our case, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is being summed. So, if all pairs are in triplet-like relations, each S_i·S_j would have expectation value (1/4) ħ². But our state has S_total = 1, so each pair doesn't necessarily have the same expectation value.

Wait, no. Actually, in the |1,0> state, which is a symmetric combination of two spins up and one spin down, the expectation value of each S_i·S_j can be calculated.

So, for each pair, say S1·S2, what is the expectation value in the |1,0> state.

Let me compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>.

Since S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2). Wait, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of the singlet and triplet components.

Wait, but in the |1,0> state, the total spin is 1, so (S1 + S2 + S3) is in the S=1 representation. So, S1 + S2 + S3 is a vector with magnitude sqrt(2) ħ in the S=1 state.

Hmm, perhaps it's complicated.

Alternatively, let's compute <S1·S2>.

We can write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total^2), where S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

Wait, but S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3)/2. Wait, no.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. So, since S1·S2 is part of the S_total^2, which is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, to find <S1·S2>, we can write <S1·S2> = (<S_total^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> - <S3^2>)/2.

Given that <S_total^2> = 2 ħ², and <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ².

So, <S1·S2> = (2 ħ² - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2 = (2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = (-1/4 ħ²)/2 = -1/8 ħ².

Wait, that's negative? But earlier, I thought S1·S2 would be positive in triplet states. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, that suggests that the expectation value of S1·S2 is negative, which would imply that the pair is in a singlet-like state. But in our state, we have total spin S=1, so perhaps not all pairs have negative expectation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, <S1·S2> = ( <S_total^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> ) / 2. Is that correct?

Wait, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. So yes, that's correct.

So, <S1·S2> = ( < (S1 + S2)^2 > - <S1^2> - <S2^2> ) / 2.

But (S1 + S2)^2 is S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so < (S1 + S2)^2 > = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>.

Plugging that in, we have:

< S1·S2 > = ( <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> ) / 2 = (2 <S1·S2>) / 2 = <S1·S2>.

Wait, that just brings us back. Hmm.

Wait, that approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, let's compute <S1·S2> directly.

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Since our state is symmetric under permutation, we can compute the expectation value for each term.

But perhaps it's easier to use another approach.

Let me write the state psi as (up up down + up down up + down up up)/sqrt(3).

So, let's express psi in terms of computational basis states. Each term is a product of up or down for each spin. Let's denote |i> = |s1, s2, s3>, where each s is ±1/2 (up or down).

So, our state is:

psi = ( |++-> |---, no wait: particle 1 up, particle 2 up, particle 3 down; similarly for others.

So, more precisely:

psi = ( |1: up, 2: up, 3: down> + |1: up, 2: down, 3: up> + |1: down, 2: up, 3: up> ) / sqrt(3).

Each spin is in the computational basis.

So, to compute <S1·S2>, we can note that S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + (1/2) S1^z S2^z.

So, compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, we can use the identity that for any two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 is:

< S1·S2 > = ( < S1^x S2^x > + < S1^y S2^y > + < S1^z S2^z > ) / 1.

But to compute this, perhaps it's better to use the matrix elements.

Alternatively, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the singlet state is -3/4 ħ², and in the triplet states it's 1/4 ħ². Wait, but in our case, the state is a superposition of triplet and singlet states?

Wait, psi is a symmetric state with two ups and one down. Wait, actually, no, the singlet state has two spins down and one up, but that's antisymmetric. Or wait, no, the singlet is (up down - down up)/sqrt(2), which is antisymmetric.

Whereas our state is symmetric, so it's a triplet state, as we thought earlier.

So, for the triplet state with two spins up and one spin down, each pair (like S1 and S2) has an expectation value of 1/4 ħ², and the cross terms (S1·S3, S2·S3) would also have expectation value 1/4 ħ².

But wait, if that's the case, then each S_i·S_j has expectation value 1/4 ħ², so the sum would be 3*(1/4) ħ² = 3/4 ħ², so H = A*(3/4 ħ²) = (3/4) A ħ².

But again, this contradicts the expected answer of 2/3 A ħ².

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value of each S_i·S_j is different.

Wait, let's consider a pair, say S1 and S2.

In the triplet state |1,0>, each pair has a certain correlation. Let's compute <S1·S2>.

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total^2), but wait, S_total here includes S3 as well. So, that approach doesn't directly work.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2).

But S1 + S2 is part of the total spin S_total, but with S3. So, that might not help.

Alternatively, let's note that in the |1,0> state, the total spin S = 1.

Thus, (S1 + S2 + S3) is a vector with magnitude sqrt(2) ħ.

But for each pair, S1·S2 can be computed as follows:

We can write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2). 

But (S1 + S2) is a vector, and in the subspace spanned by S=1 and S=0, but since our state is in the S=1 subspace, (S1 + S2) would have magnitude sqrt(S(S+1) - S3(S3+1)) ħ. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that in the |1,0> state, S_total^z = 0, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the |1,0> state.

Let me express S1·S2 in terms of the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

So, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4) (σ1·σ2).

Similarly, σ1·σ2 = 2 I - (σ1)^2 - (σ2)^2, but actually, σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

But in any case, the expectation value <σ1·σ2> in a given state can be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps compute matrix elements.

But maybe an alternative approach: for the given state psi, which is a linear combination of |++->, |++->, etc., let's compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

Note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, <psi | S1^x S2^x | psi> + <psi | S1^y S2^y | psi> + <psi | S1^z S2^z | psi>.

Since the state psi is symmetric with respect to permutation, the expectation values of S1^x S2^x, S1^y S2^y, and S1^z S2^z are the same.

So, we can compute one and multiply by 3.

Let me compute <S1^z S2^z>.

In the state psi, each term is a product state with two ups and one down.

So, for each term in psi:

- In |++->, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2.

- In |++->, same.

- In |++->, same.

So, the expectation value <S1^z S2^z> is (1/2)(1/2) + similar terms.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as follows.

Compute <psi | S1^z S2^z | psi>.

Each term in psi is a product state, so we can expand this.

Let me denote the basis states as |a b c>, where a, b, c are ±1.

So, psi is (|++-> + |++-> + |---?) Wait, no: wait, in the case of psi, in each term, exactly two are up and one is down.

So, for example, the first term is |++->, second is |+->+, third is <-++.

So, the state psi is (|++-> + |+->+ + <-++)/sqrt(3).

Now, to compute <psi | S1^z S2^z | psi>.

Since S1^z acts on the first spin, S2^z acts on the second spin, and the third spin is unaffected.

So, in each term, when we apply S1^z and S2^z, we get:

S1^z |++-> = (1/2) |++->

S2^z |++-> = (1/2) |++->

Similarly for the other terms.

So, let's compute each term:

psi = (|++-> + |+->+ + <-++)/sqrt(3).

So, <psi | S1^z S2^z | psi> is the sum over all i,j of <psi_i| S1^z S2^z |psi_j>.

Which is (1/3) sum_{i,j} <i| S1^z S2^z |j>.

Each |i> and |j> are the product states.

So, for each i and j, compute <i| S1^z S2^z |j>.

Note that S1^z and S2^z are diagonal in the computational basis, so <i| S1^z S2^z |j> = (prod_{k=1}^3 <i_k| S1^z |j_1> ) * ( <i_2| S2^z |j_2> ) * ( <i_3| S3^z |j_3> ).

Since S3^z is acting on the third spin, which is same in all three terms of psi, because in the first term, the third spin is down, in the second term, it's up, in the third term, it's up. Wait, no, in psi, each term has two ups and one down, but the down is in different positions.

Wait, in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are up, particle 3 is down.

Second term: particles 1 and 3 are up, particle 2 is down.

Third term: particles 2 and 3 are up, particle 1 is down.

So, when i and j are different terms, the S3^z eigenvalues can be different.

Wait, so for |i> and |j>, if the third spin is the same (i.e., both up or both down), then <i_3| S3^z |j_3> = (1/2) if same, and 0 otherwise? Wait, no.

Wait, S3^z is diagonal: if the third spin is up, S3^z = +1/2 ħ, else -1/2 ħ.

So, <i_3| S3^z |j_3> is (1/2) if the third spin in |i> is up, else (-1/2).

Wait, no: <i_3| S3^z |j_3> = (1/2) <i_3 |j_3> if |j_3> is up, else (-1/2) <i_3 |j_3>.

But actually, since S3^z is diagonal, the action is just (1/2) if the third spin is up, (-1/2) if down.

But in our case, when we take |i> and |j>, their third spins can be either up or down.

So, for example, when i is |++-> and j is |++->, then <i_3| S3^z |j_3> = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

But when i is |++-> and j is |+->+, then the third spin of j is up, so same as before. Wait, no, in the second term, the third spin is up.

Wait, let me structure this properly.

Compute all terms:

There are 3 terms in psi, so 3x3=9 terms. Let me list them:

i=1: |++->

i=2: |+->+

i=3: <-++

Similarly, j=1: |++->

j=2: |+->+

j=3: <-++

Compute <i| S1^z S2^z |j> for each i,j.

Note that S1^z S2^z acts as:

For |a b c>,

S1^z |a b c> = (a) |a b c>, since S1^z is acting on the first spin.

Similarly, S2^z |a b c> = (b) |a b c>.

Therefore, S1^z S2^z |a b c> = (a b) |a b c>.

But wait, in terms of the state, S1^z S2
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as (1/sqrt(3))*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find its energy. If not, compute the expectation value of the energy.

First, let me recall some properties of spin operators. For two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i · S_j can be expressed as (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). But since we're dealing with three particles, each term like S1·S2 involves all three particles.

But wait, no. S_i·S_j for particles i and j is just the sum of their individual spin components. So S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z), and similarly for the other terms in H.

Hmm, so H is a sum of three such dot products. It might be useful to consider the total spin operator S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, H can be rewritten in terms of S.

Wait, let me think about that. The sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed as (1/2)[(S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)].

Is that correct? Let me verify. Let me recall that for any three vectors a, b, c, the sum a·b + a·c + b·c can be expressed in terms of the squares of their sums.

Yes, more generally, for a, b, c, we have:

a·b + a·c + b·c = (1/2)[(a + b)^2 + (a + c)^2 + (b + c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)].

So in this case, a = S1, b = S2, c = S3.

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)[(S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2] - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (S1 + S2)^2. That equals S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Similarly, (S1 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S3.

And (S2 + S3)^2 = S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S2·S3.

So if I sum all three, I get:

(S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 = 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, rearranging:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2.

So going back to H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [ (S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2 ).

Hmm, that might not be the most useful expression. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Wait, if I consider the total spin squared operator, S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Then expanding that:

S^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So substituting back into H:

H = A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ) = (A/2)(S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2).

Okay, since each S_i^2 is the square of the spin operator for particle i, which for spin-1/2 particles is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. Therefore, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ^2 each.

So H = (A/2)(S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2 ) = (A/2)(S^2 - (9/4)ħ^2).

So H = (A/2) S^2 - (A/2)(9/4)ħ^2.

So H = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8)ħ^2.

Therefore, H can be written in terms of S^2. Since S^2 is the total spin squared operator, its eigenvalues are known.

The eigenvalues of S^2 are S(S+1)ħ^2, where S is the total spin quantum number. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Because for three spin-1/2 particles, you can have either all three aligned (total spin 3/2) or two aligned and one opposite, etc., leading to total spin 1/2.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the state psi is given as a specific combination. Let me compute the total spin of psi.

So psi is (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). Let me see.

Each term is three spins: two up, one down, but arranged differently.

Wait, no. Each term is a product of three spins: up, up, down; up, down, up; and down, up, up. So each term has two up spins and one down spin, but in different positions.

So in each term, there are two up spins and one down spin.

So the total number of up spins is two in each term, so the total spin in each term is... wait, spin is a vector quantity. So each spin up contributes (1/2)ħ in the z-direction, and spin down is (-1/2)ħ.

So in each term, the total spin in the z-direction is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ.

Wait, so each term has two up spins and one down spin, so total S_z is 1/2 ħ. So the state psi is a combination of states with S_z = 1/2 ħ.

Wait, but is the total spin S for the state psi equal to 1/2?

Wait, let's compute the total spin. The state psi is symmetric under permutation of the particles? Let me see.

If we swap particles 1 and 2, for example, up1 up2 down3 becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the first term. Similarly for the other terms, so psi is symmetric under permutation of the spins.

So the state is symmetric. So what is the total spin? Let's see.

If the state is symmetric, it must be in an eigenstate of S^2 with quantum number S. So S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But since each term has S_z = 1/2, and there are three terms, perhaps the state is in a triplet state, which has S = 1/2 or S = 3/2? Wait, no.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet states have S = 1, with m_s = 1, 0, -1, and the singlet has S = 0.

But here we have three particles, so the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the states are either symmetric or antisymmetric. Since our state is symmetric, it must be in the symmetric representation, which corresponds to the triplet with S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, but let's think about this. The state is a symmetric combination of three states, each with two up spins and one down spin. So each term has S_z = 1/2. Thus, the total S_z is 3*(1/2)ħ? No, wait, each term is not summed over multiple states.

Wait, actually, the state is a linear combination of three different states, each with two spins up and one down. So the total S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z for the state psi.

In each term, the z-component of the spin is 1/2 ħ. So for each term, it's 1/2 ħ. So when we compute the expectation value of S_z, we average over the state.

But psi is a symmetric combination of three states, each with S_z = 1/2 ħ. Therefore, the expectation value of S_z is 1/2 ħ.

Wait, but the state is a symmetric combination, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue 3*(1/2) ħ? That can't be because S_z is the sum of individual spins.

Wait, no, the total S_z is the sum of each spin's z-component.

Each term in psi is a product state with two up spins and one down spin, so each term has S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) ħ = 1/2 ħ.

But since the state psi is a symmetric combination, when you take the expectation value of S_z, you should get 1/2 ħ.

Wait, no. Let me compute the expectation value of S_z. The state is (1/sqrt(3))*( |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ).

So the expectation value of S_z is (1/3)(<up up down|S_z |up up down> + <up up down|S_z |up down up> + <up up down|S_z |down up up> + ... for all terms).

But each term is orthogonal? Wait, no. If psi is a sum of orthogonal states, their inner products are zero. Wait, are these states orthogonal?

Wait, the states |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up> are all orthogonal? Let me check.

In three particles, each in a spin state, two up and one down. The states are different because the down spin is in different positions. So yes, they are orthogonal. Because you can't have two identical states with the down spin in different positions.

Therefore, the inner product between any two terms is zero. So when you compute the expectation value of S_z, it's (1/3)(<up up down|S_z |up up down> + ... ).

Each of the diagonal terms is (1/2)ħ, and the others are zero.

So the expectation value of S_z is (1/3)*(1/2 ħ + 1/2 ħ + 1/2 ħ) = (1/3)*(3/2 ħ) = 1/2 ħ.

So the state psi has S_z = (1/2) ħ.

But what about S^2? Is psi an eigenstate of S^2?

Since psi is symmetric, it's in the symmetric representation of the spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states have total spin S = 3/2 and S = 1/2.

So we need to check whether psi is in the S = 3/2 triplet or the S = 1/2 triplet.

How can I determine that? Well, let's consider the possible S^2 eigenvalues.

If psi is an eigenstate of S^2, then S^2 psi = S(S+1) ħ^2 psi.

So we can compute the expectation value of S^2 for psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total spin squared.

But computing S^2 involves summing all the individual spins.

Wait, let me recall that S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already have S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2 each.

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ^2)/2.

But H is given as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H = A*(S^2 - (9/4) ħ^2)/2.

Thus, if I can compute S^2 for psi, then I can find H.

So let me compute the expectation value of S^2 for psi.

First, remember that S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But perhaps it's easier to use the fact that for any state, <S^2> = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

Which is 3*(3/4 ħ^2) + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

So <S^2> = (9/4) ħ^2 + 2 < S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then <H> = A < S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

So if I can compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>, then I can find <H> and also, since <S^2> is known, maybe find the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find <S^2> and then relate it to H.

Wait, since H is expressed in terms of S^2, perhaps H can be written as (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ^2.

Therefore, if psi is an eigenstate of S^2, then H psi = (A/2) S^2 psi - (9A/8) ħ^2 psi.

If psi is an eigenstate of S^2, then H psi would just be proportional to psi.

Thus, to check if psi is an eigenstate of H, we need to check if it is an eigenstate of S^2.

So perhaps I should compute <S^2> for psi.

To compute <S^2>, we can use the fact that S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

So <S^2> = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

As before, <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ^2 each.

So <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 9/4 ħ^2.

Now, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = <H>/A.

Wait, but we don't know <H> yet. So perhaps we can write <S^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <H>/A.

But we can also compute <S^2> another way. Since S^2 is the total spin operator squared, which for a given eigenstate would give S(S + 1) ħ^2.

Therefore, if psi is an eigenstate of S^2, then <S^2> = S(S + 1) ħ^2.

So if I can compute <S^2>, I can find S, and then compute <H>.

So let me compute <S^2> another way.

Compute <psi|S^2|psi>.

But S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

So S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are diagonal in the computational basis of individual spins, so their expectation values are each (3/4) ħ^2 as before.

Now, for the cross terms, like <psi|(S1·S2)|psi>.

Similarly, <psi|(S1·S3)|psi> and <psi|(S2·S3)|psi>.

Each of these can be computed.

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So to compute <S1·S2>, we can compute each component separately.

Similarly, for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Let me compute <S1·S2>.

First, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z for psi.

Each term in psi is |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up>.

In |up up down>, S1^z = 1/2 ħ, S2^z = 1/2 ħ, so their product is (1/2)^2 ħ^2.

Similarly, the same for |up down up>: S1^z = 1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so product is -1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, no. Wait, in |up down up>, the first spin is up, second is down, third is up. So S1^z is 1/2, S2^z is -1/2, so S1^z S2^z = -1/4.

Similarly, in |down up up>, S1^z is -1/2, S2^z is 1/2, so S1^z S2^z = -1/4.

Wait, but in each term, the two up spins are in different positions. Wait, actually, in each term, each spin is either up or down, so for S1^z S2^z, the product is (1/2)(1/2) or (1/2)(-1/2) or (-1/2)(1/2), depending on the term.

Wait, let me list the three terms:

1. |up up down>: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

2. |up down up>: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

3. |down up up>: S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

So for each term, the product S1^z S2^z is:

1. (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4.

2. (+1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

3. (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is (1/3)(1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) = (1/3)(-1/4) = -1/12 ħ^2.

Wait, no, in each term, the product is 1/4, -1/4, -1/4, so when you average over all three terms, it's (1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4))/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Similarly, for the other components: S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y.

But S^x and S^y are more complicated because they are raising and lowering operators.

Recall that S1^x = (S1^+ + S1^-)/2 and S1^y = (-i)(S1^+ - S1^-)/2.

So S1^x S2^x = [ (S1^+ + S1^-)/2 ] [ (S2^+ + S2^-)/2 ].

Expanding this, we get (S1^+ S2^+ + S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ + S1^- S2^-)/4.

Similarly for S1^y S2^y.

But in our state psi, which is symmetric, we might be able to compute these expectation values.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) ħ^2.

So S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> = (1/2) <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4) ħ^2.

Similarly, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S1·S2>.

Wait, but that's recursive because S1·S2 is part of the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between spin states and their total spin.

But we can recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S = 0, so S1·S2 = - (3/4) ħ^2.

The triplet states have S = 1, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) ħ^2.

But in our case, the state is a combination of three product states, each with two up and one down. Maybe it's better to think about this in terms of total spin.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the state psi is a combination of the three possible states with two up spins and one down spin, so it's a symmetric state with S = 1/2.

Wait, but let me think. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The state psi is symmetric, so it must be in the 1/2 or 3/2 representations.

If it's in the 3/2 representation, then the state would have S = 3/2, and if it's in the 1/2 representation, it's S = 1/2.

Is there a way to find the total spin S of psi?

Well, in the 3/2 representation, all three spins are aligned in some way, but in our case, the state has two up and one down spin. So it can't be all up or all down.

Wait, but with two up and one down, the total spin can't be 3/2 because that would require all three spins to be aligned, which would give S_z = 3/2 ħ, which isn't the case here.

Therefore, psi must be in the S = 1/2 representation.

Thus, the total spin S is 1/2, and so <S^2> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

So, going back, <S^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

Therefore:

3/4 ħ^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

Wait, that can't be. Let me write it step by step.

If <S^2> = 3/4 ħ^2, then:

3/4 ħ^2 = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

Which is 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

So,

3/4 ħ^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

So,

2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3/4 ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 = (-6/4) ħ^2 = (-3/2) ħ^2.

Therefore,

<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (-3/4) ħ^2.

So, <H> = A * (-3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, that seems contradictory to the given answer, which is that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, so either my reasoning is wrong, or I misapplied something.

Wait, let me double-check.

If the state psi is in the S = 1/2 representation, then <S^2> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2. So that part is correct.

Then, since S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, then:

<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = ( <S^2> - <S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2> ) / 2.

Which is (3/4 ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 = (-6/4 ħ^2)/2 = (-6/8) ħ^2 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

So yes, that is correct.

Therefore, <H> = A*(-3/4) ħ^2. But the given answer says it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3) A ħ^2.

Hmm, so perhaps my assumption that the state is in the S = 1/2 representation is wrong, or perhaps the state is not an eigenstate of S^2, meaning that even though it's symmetric, it's not an eigenstate.

Wait, but if the state is a symmetric combination, it should be in the S = 1/2 or S = 3/2 representations.

Wait, how can we tell?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the action of S^2 on the state psi.

Let me try to compute S^2 acting on psi.

But S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

So S^2 |psi> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>.

But if I can compute this, perhaps we can see if S^2 |psi> is proportional to |psi>, indicating it's an eigenstate.

But this computation might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, let me consider the basis states.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the Hilbert space is 8-dimensional.

The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional (since the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2, each with multiplets of dimensions 2 and 2 or something? Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states form a 4-dimensional subspace (since the total symmetric states are 4, and antisymmetric are 4).

Wait, actually, the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional and the antisymmetric is 4-dimensional. So our state psi is in the symmetric subspace.

In the symmetric subspace, the states are either S=3/2 (triplet) with 3 states or S=1/2 (triplet) with 3 states. Wait, actually, for spin 3/2 with three particles, the multiplet is 2-dimensional, and for spin 1/2, it's 2-dimensional as well.

Wait, no, total spin S=3/2 corresponds to a 2-dimensional representation (since 2S + 1 = 2*3/2 + 1 = 4, wait, no, 2S + 1 is the dimension. So S=3/2, dimension 4; S=1/2, dimension 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing.

Wait, no. Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, S=1 corresponds to triplet (3 states), S=0 corresponds to singlet (1 state).

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

The dimension of the S=3/2 representation is 2S + 1 = 4, and S=1/2 representation is 2.

So the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional (S=3/2) + 2-dimensional (S=1/2) = 6, which is correct because total symmetric states for 3 particles are 4 (since antisymmetric is 4, total is 8).

Wait, no, 3 particles each with spin 1/2, the total spin states are 8.

The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, and antisymmetric is 4-dimensional.

Within symmetric subspace, S=3/2 has dimension 4 (since 2S +1=4 when S=3/2), and S=1/2 has dimension 2.

Wait, no, that can't be. S=3/2 has dimension 2S+1=4, but 2S+1=4 only when S=3/2, right.

So yes, symmetric subspace has S=3/2 (4 states) and S=1/2 (2 states). Wait, but 4 + 2 = 6, which is not 4.

Wait, I must have messed up.

Wait, actually for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states are constructed by symmetrizing the product states.

The total symmetric states are 4-dimensional. So there can only be one multiplet in symmetric states for S=3/2, but let's see.

Wait, no, it's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the symmetric group S3 acts on the three spin-1/2 particles. The spin states can be classified according to their symmetry under permutation.

The singlet state for three particles isn't possible because it would be an antisymmetric product, but each permutation of the three spins would lead to the same state, so actually, the spin states can have overall symmetry either symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin states are those that are invariant under exchange of any two particles.

In our case, psi is symmetric, so it's in the symmetric spin subspace.

The symmetric spin subspace has dimension 4 (since the total spin states are 8, symmetric and antisymmetric sum to 8, each 4-dimensional).

Wait, then within the symmetric subspace, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

But for S=3/2, the dimension is 2S +1 = 4, which fits.

But for S=1/2, the dimension is 2, which is less than 4, so we can have both S=3/2 and S=1/2 in the symmetric subspace.

So our state psi is in the symmetric subspace, but it's not clear whether it has S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, let's see.

What is the action of S1^2 on psi?

Wait, since S1^2 is the square of spin operator for particle 1, it acts only on the first spin.

But since psi is a symmetric combination of states with different spins for the first, second, and third particles, S1^2 acting on psi would just give 3/4 ħ^2 psi, because each term in psi has the first spin either up or down, but squared, it would be the same for each term.

Wait, perhaps not, because S1^2 is a diagonal operator on the first spin. So if we have a symmetric state, the eigenvalue would be the average of S1^2 for each term.

But wait, the first spin in each term is up or down, so S1^2 acting on each term gives (3/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, S1^2 psi = (3/4) ħ^2 psi.

Similarly, S2^2 psi = (3/4) ħ^2 psi and S3^2 psi = (3/4) ħ^2 psi.

So, if psi is an eigenstate of S1^2, S2^2, and S3^2, then it's an eigenstate of S^2 as well.

Wait, but if S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 all act as (3/4) ħ^2 on psi, then S^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) would have eigenvalue 9/4 ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

But earlier, we found that <S^2> = 3/4 ħ^2, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in computing <S^2>. Let me see.

Wait, <S^2> is the expectation value of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. So expanding that, we have S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So the expectation value is <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

We already have <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = 3/4 ħ^2, each. So <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 9/4 ħ^2.

We also have <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (-3/4) ħ^2, as computed earlier.

Therefore, <S^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(-
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian, and I need to determine if a given spin-state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of the energy. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). 

First, I should recall some properties of spin-1/2 particles and their operators. Each spin operator S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin magnitude is s = 1/2. The dot product of two spin operators S_i·S_j can be expanded as S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z. 

I remember that S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin operator squared. The formula is S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. This might be useful because the state psi could have a well-defined total spin, which would make S_total^2 a good quantum number.

So, let's consider the given state psi. It is a symmetric combination of three terms where two spins are up and one is down. Specifically, each term has two up spins and one down spin. The coefficient 1/sqrt(3) suggests that it's an equally weighted combination of the three possible configurations. 

Wait, let me think about the total spin of this state. Since each term has two spins up and one spin down, the total z-component of spin is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. Hmm, that's not zero, so the total spin S_total is not zero. But perhaps the state has a well-defined S_total^2. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of H on the state psi. Since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), perhaps I can write H in terms of S_total^2. Let me compute S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. 

As I noted earlier, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Similarly for the other terms. So adding them together:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2) + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2) + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2) ] / 2

Simplify numerator:

3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)

So overall:

[3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2

But S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for each spin-1/2 particle. So S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, the numerator becomes 3*S_total^2 - 2*(9/4)ħ².

So putting it all together:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [3*S_total^2 - (9/2)ħ²] / 2

Thus, H = A*( [3*S_total^2 - (9/2)ħ²] / 2 ) = (3A/2)*S_total^2 - (9A/4)ħ².

Therefore, H can be written in terms of S_total^2.

So now, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the state psi, I can find the eigenvalue of H.

So, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>. If the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H will be an eigenvalue as well.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the state is symmetric in some sense. Let me try to analyze the state. The state psi is a combination where two particles are up and one is down. So, each term is a permutation of two ups and one down. 

This suggests that the state is symmetric under exchange of particles, but it's not clear how S_total acts on it.

Wait, maybe I can compute S_total^2 for the state psi.

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S_total^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But from earlier, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [3*S_total^2 - (9/2)ħ²]/2

Wait, perhaps I can solve for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 in terms of S_total^2. Alternatively, maybe I can express S_total^2 in terms of H.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

So, let me compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

First, note that S_total^2 can be written in terms of the individual S_i components:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Which is 3*(3/4 ħ²) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S_total^2 = (9/4 ħ²) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Then, from H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = H/A

So, S_total^2 = (9/4 ħ²) + 2*(H/A)

Therefore, H = (2A)*S_total^2 - (9/2)ħ²

Wait, that's consistent with earlier.

But perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for the state psi.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and S_total^2 is known in terms of H.

But perhaps it's better to compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi> directly.

Alternatively, I can compute the action of S_total^2 on each term in the state psi.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately.

Given that, perhaps I can compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, and similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3, then sum them up and multiply by A.

So, let's try that approach.

First, let me write out the state psi.

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So, each term is a permutation with two ups and one down.

Now, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>

But S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)

Since the state is symmetric in the spins, maybe the expectation value can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the dot product of two spin operators is related to the spin singlet and triplet states.

Wait, but S_i·S_j acts on the combined spin states of particles i and j. So, perhaps I can consider the state of particles 1 and 2 in each term, and see how S1·S2 acts on that.

But let me think about this step by step.

Since the state psi involves all three particles, perhaps it's helpful to consider the state of particles 1 and 2 within each term.

For example, take the first term |↑↑↓⟩. In this term, particles 1 and 2 are both in |↑⟩. So, what is the action of S1·S2 on this term?

Similarly, for the second term |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively, and the third term |↓↑↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↓⟩ and |↑⟩.

Wait, maybe it's better to express each term in the state as a product state of particles 1, 2, and 3. Then, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, leaving particle 3 untouched.

So, for each term in psi, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, and the state of particle 3 remains as it is.

Therefore, for each term |s1 s2 s3⟩, S1·S2 |s1 s2 s3⟩ = (S1·S2)^{s1 s2} |s1 s2⟩ |s3⟩

But perhaps I can compute the expectation value <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Alternatively, perhaps note that in each term of psi, particles 1 and 2 have definite spins, either both up, or opposite spins.

Wait, actually, in the state psi, for each term, particles 1 and 2 have either both up, or one up and one down. So, for |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so in this case, (S1·S2) acting on |↑↑⟩ would give something.

Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, (S1·S2) has eigenvalues. For two spins, the possible total spin states are singlet (total spin 0) and triplet (total spin 1). The eigenvalue of S1·S2 for the triplet state is (ħ²)(1(1+1) - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (ħ²)(2 - 3/2)/2 = (ħ²)(1/2)/2 = ħ²/4.

Wait, more precisely, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. So, for a given state, the eigenvalue of S1·S2 is [ (S_total^2) - (3/4 ħ²) - (3/4 ħ²) ] / 2 = [S_total^2 - (3/2 ħ²)] / 2

So, for the triplet state (total spin 1), S_total^2 = 2ħ² (since s=1, s(s+1)=2). So, S1·S2 = [2ħ² - 3/2 ħ²]/2 = (1/2 ħ²)/2 = ħ²/4.

For the singlet state (total spin 0), S_total^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = [0 - 3/2 ħ²]/2 = (-3/4 ħ²). 

Therefore, for any two-spin state, the eigenvalue of S1·S2 can be either ħ²/4 (for triplet) or -3ħ²/4 (for singlet). 

Now, in the state psi, each term is a product state of three spins. Let's consider each term:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, which is a triplet state (since both are up). So, the eigenvalue of S1·S2 for this part is ħ²/4.

2. |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 and 2 are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which is a singlet state (since their spins are opposite). So, the eigenvalue of S1·S2 for this part is -3ħ²/4.

3. |↓↑↑⟩: similar to the first term, particles 1 and 2 are |↓⟩ and |↑⟩, which is a singlet state. So, eigenvalue is -3ħ²/4.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in each term, particles 1 and 2 are in a specific state. For |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↑⟩, which is a triplet. For |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↓⟩, which is a singlet. Similarly for |↓↑↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩, which is a singlet.

But actually, the state psi is a superposition of these three terms. So, when we apply S1·S2 to each term, the operator acts only on particles 1 and 2, leaving particle 3 as it is. Then, when we take the expectation value, we need to consider all terms.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state psi. Let's proceed.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of the three terms with two ups and one down. So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we can expand it as:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] * S1·S2 * [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Since S1·S2 acts only on the first two particles, we can treat each term separately.

So, for each term in the bra and ket, we can compute the contribution.

Let's denote the three basis states as:

A = |↑↑↓⟩,

B = |↑↓↑⟩,

C = |↓↑↑⟩,

So, psi = (A + B + C)/sqrt(3)

Compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>:

= (1/3) [ <A| + <B| + <C| ] S1·S2 [ |A⟩ + |B⟩ + |C⟩ ]

= (1/3) [ <A|S1·S2|A> + <A|S1·S2|B> + <A|S1·S2|C> + <B|S1·S2|A> + <B|S1·S2|B> + <B|S1·S2|C> + <C|S1·S2|A> + <C|S1·S2|B> + <C|S1·S2|C> ]

Now, let's compute each term.

1. <A| S1·S2 |A>:

In state A, particles 1 and 2 are both |↑⟩, so S1·S2 acting on A gives (S1·S2)^{↑↑} acting on the first two particles, which is (ħ²/4) |↑↑⟩, then tensor with |↓⟩.

So, <A| S1·S2 |A> = ħ²/4 * <A|A> = ħ²/4 *1 = ħ²/4.

2. <A| S1·S2 |B>:

In state A, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↑⟩; state B has particles 1 and 2 as |↑↓⟩. So, S1·S2 acting on B will give something.

But actually, since S1·S2 is an operator on particles 1 and 2, we can compute its matrix elements between the states |↑↑⟩ and |↑↓⟩.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the matrix element explicitly.

The operator S1·S2 can be written as (1/4)(|↑↓⟩⟨↑↓| + |↓↑⟩⟨↓↑| - |↑↑⟩⟨↑↑| - |↓↓⟩⟨↓↓|). Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me recall that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

In terms of spin states, S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0, S1^- |↓⟩ = 0, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the eigenstates of S1·S2 are the singlet and triplet states.

In the state |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet, S1·S2 has eigenvalue ħ²/4.

In the state |↑↓⟩, which is part of the singlet, S1·S2 has eigenvalue -3ħ²/4.

So, for the matrix element <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩, this is the overlap between a triplet state and a singlet state, which should be zero.

Similarly, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = 0.

So, for term 2 and 3:

<A|S1·S2|B> = <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩. But since S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, it's equivalent to <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ acting on particle 3.

So, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = 0, as established. So, the entire term <A|S1·S2|B> = 0.

Similarly, <A|S1·S2|C> = <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩. Again, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so it's <↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = 0. So, this term is 0.

Similarly, for <B|S1·S2|A>:

State B is |↑↓↑⟩. So <↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩. We already saw that <↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <B|S1·S2|C> = <↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = 0.

Now, term 4: <B| S1·S2 |B>:

In state B, particles 1 and 2 are |↑↓⟩, so S1·S2 acting on this state gives (-3ħ²/4) |↑↓⟩, and the third particle is |↑⟩.

So, <B| S1·S2 |B> = (-3ħ²/4) * <B|B> = (-3ħ²/4)*1 = -3ħ²/4.

Term 5: <B| S1·S2 |C>:

State B is |↑↓↑⟩, state C is |↓↑↑⟩. So, <↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩.

Again, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so it's <↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩.

But in the combined spin basis of particles 1 and 2, |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are orthogonal, and S1·S2 has different eigenvalues. However, the expectation value might not be zero, but let me think again.

Wait, actually, in the product state picture, the states |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are orthogonal and belong to different eigenstates of S1·S2. So, the matrix element <↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ would be zero because they are orthogonal eigenstates with different eigenvalues.

Yes, because S1·S2 has eigenstates that are symmetric (triplet) and antisymmetric (singlet). Since |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are part of the singlet state which is antisymmetric, and their inner product is zero.

Therefore, <↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <C|S1·S2|A> = <↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = 0.

Term 6: <C| S1·S2 |C>:

State C is |↓↑↑⟩, so particles 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩, which is a singlet state. So, S1·S2 acting on this gives (-3ħ²/4) |↓↑⟩, then tensor with |↑⟩.

Thus, <C| S1·S2 |C> = (-3ħ²/4) * <C|C> = (-3ħ²/4)*1 = -3ħ²/4.

Term 7 and 8: <C| S1·S2 |B> and others are zero as above.

Now, putting all terms together:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-3ħ²/4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-3ħ²/4) ]

Simplify the terms inside:

= (1/3)[ ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 ]

= (1/3)[ (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ħ² ]

Convert to common denominator:

1/4 = 1/4,

3/4 = 3/4,

so:

= (1/3)[ (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ] ħ²

= (1/3)[ (-5/4) ] ħ²

= (-5/12) ħ²

So, <S1·S2> = (-5/12) ħ²

Wait, but that's only for S1·S2. Similarly, we need to compute <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>, and then add them all together.

Let me proceed similarly for S1·S3.

Compute <psi| S1·S3 |psi>:

Again, using the same expansion.

But now, S1·S3 acts on particles 1 and 3, so within each term, particles 1 and 3.

So, let's see:

Term A: |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↓⟩.

Term B: |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↑⟩.

Term C: |↓↑↑⟩, particles 1 and 3 are |↓↑⟩.

So, for each term, particles 1 and 3: A: |↑↓⟩, B: |↑↑⟩, C: |↓↑⟩.

Again, using the same approach as before, let's compute the expectation value.

So, <psi| S1·S3 |psi> = (1/3)[ <A| + <B| + <C| ] S1·S3 [ |A⟩ + |B⟩ + |C⟩ ]

Again, expanding all terms:

1. <A| S1·S3 |A> = <↑↑↓| S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

In this term, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↓⟩, which is a singlet state, so S1·S3 acting on this would give (-3ħ²/4) |↑↓⟩, then tensor with particle 2.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in the term A, particles 2 is fixed as |↑⟩, so when S1·S3 acts on A, it acts on particles 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix elements between |↑↓⟩ and |↑↑⟩ and |↓↑⟩.

Wait, in state A: particles 1 and 3 are |↑↓⟩, so S1·S3 acting on this state would be (-3ħ²/4) |↑↓⟩, and the second particle is |↑⟩. So, <A| S1·S3 |A> = (-3ħ²/4) * <A|A> = (-3ħ²/4).

Similarly, for state B: particles 1 and 3 are |↑↑⟩, which is a triplet state, so S1·S3 acting on this gives (ħ²/4) |↑↑⟩, and the second particle is |↓⟩. So, <B| S1·S3 |B> = (ħ²/4) * <B|B> = ħ²/4.

For state C: particles 1 and 3 are |↓↑⟩, which is a singlet state, so S1·S3 acting on this gives (-3ħ²/4) |↓↑⟩, and the second particle is |↑⟩. So, <C| S1·S3 |C> = (-3ħ²/4) * <C|C> = (-3ħ²/4).

Now, cross terms:

<A| S1·S3 |B> = <↑↑↓| S1·S3 |↑↓↑⟩.

S1·S3 acts on particles 1 and 3, so it's <↑↑| S1·S3 |↑↑⟩ acting on the second particle.

Wait, no, more precisely, in state B, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↑⟩, so when S1·S3 acts on B, it gives (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ for particles 1 and 3, and leaves particle 2 as |↓⟩.

Similarly, in state A, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↓⟩, so S1·S3 acting on A gives (-3ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩.

So, the inner product <A| S1·S3 |B> is <↑↑↓| S1·S3 |↑↓↑⟩ = <↑↓| (S1·S3 acting on particles 1 and 3) |↑↑⟩ * <↑| particle 2.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

S1·S3 acts on particles 1 and 3, so in state A: |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S3 |A⟩ = (-3ħ²/4)|↑↓⟩ |↑⟩.

In state B: |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S3 |B⟩ = (ħ²/4)|↑↑⟩ |↓⟩.

So, <A| S1·S3 |B> = (-3ħ²/4) <↑↑↓|↑↑⟩ <↑|↓> + (ħ²/4) <↑↑↓|↑↓⟩ <↑|↑>

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that S1·S3 acts on particles 1 and 3, so the matrix elements depend only on the states of 1 and 3, and particle 2 is separate.

Therefore, the matrix element <A| S1·S3 |B> is the inner product between the states of particles 1 and 3 in A and B, multiplied by the corresponding coefficients.

Specifically, state A: particles 1 and 3: |↑↓⟩, state B: particles 1 and 3: |↑↑⟩.

So, <↑↓| S1·S3 |↑↑⟩.

But since S1·S3 is a scalar operator acting on particles 1 and 3, the value is (-3ħ²/4) <↑↓|↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/4) <↑↓|↑↑⟩? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, S1·S3 has eigenvalues for each basis state.

Wait, in the combined spin state of particles 1 and 3, |↑↑⟩ is a triplet state (eigenvalue ħ²/4), and |↑↓⟩ is a singlet state (eigenvalue -3ħ²/4).

But the inner product between |↑↑⟩ and |↑↓⟩ is zero, because they are orthogonal.

Therefore, <↑↓| S1·S3 |↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <A| S1·S3 |B> = 0.

Similarly, <A| S1·S3 |C>:

In state A, particles 1 and 3: |↑↓⟩, in state C, particles 1 and 3: |↓↑⟩.

So, <↑↓| S1·S3 |↓↑⟩.

Again, since S1·S3 has eigenstates |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, etc. The states |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are both singlet states, but orthogonal.

So, <↑↓| S1·S3 |↓↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <B| S1·S3 |A> = 0.

<B| S1·S3 |C>:

State B: particles 1 and 3: |↑↑⟩, state C: particles 1 and 3: |↓↑⟩.

So, <↑↑| S1·S3 |↓↑⟩ = 0, since they're orthogonal.

Similarly, <C| S1·S3 |A> = <↓↑| S1·S3 |↑↓⟩ = 0.

<C| S1·S3 |B> = <↓↑| S1·S3 |↑↑⟩ = 0.

Thus, all cross terms are zero.

Therefore, the expectation value <psi| S1·S3 |psi> is:

(1/3)[ (-3ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) + (-3ħ²/4) ]

= (1/3)[ (-3/4 + 1/4 -3/4) ħ² ]

= (1/3)[ (-5/4) ħ² ]

= (-5/12) ħ²

Similarly, we need to compute <psi| S2·S3 |psi>.

But due to the symmetry of the state psi, which is symmetric in all three particles, I expect that <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3> are all equal.

Therefore, <psi| S2·S3 |psi> should also be (-5/12) ħ².

So, summing up all three:

<psi| H |psi> = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

= A*( (-5/12) ħ² + (-5/12) ħ² + (-5/12) ħ² )

= A*( -15/12 ħ² ) = A*(-5/4) ħ²

Wait, but the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ², so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, in the computation of <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, I found it to be (-5/12) ħ². Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3. So total expectation value is (-15/12) A ħ², which is (-5/4) A ħ².

But this contradicts the correct answer given, which is 2/3 A ħ². So, I must have made an error.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption that all three terms contribute equally is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation values.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the expectation value of S1·S2. Let me double-check.

In the computation of <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, I had:

(A + B + C)/sqrt(3) as psi.

Then, I expanded the expectation value into 9 terms, and found that the diagonal terms (A|A>, B|B>, C|C>) give ħ²/4, -3ħ²/4, -3ħ²/4 respectively.

The cross terms all give zero.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/3)( ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 - 3ħ²/4 ) = (1/3)( -5ħ²/4 ) = -5ħ²/12.

Similarly for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>.

Thus, total expectation value is -5ħ²/4 * A.

But according to the correct answer, it should be 2/3 A ħ². So, I must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the state is not symmetric. Let me check the state again.

The state psi is given as (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3).

Yes, this is symmetric under permutation of particles, so all three terms are equally weighted.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the eigenvalues for S1·S2 in each term.

Wait, when particles 1 and 2 are both up, they form a triplet state, so S1·S2 has eigenvalue ħ²/4.

When they are opposite, they form a singlet state, so eigenvalue is -3ħ²/4.

But in the state psi, each term has two up and one down. So, in each term, for S1·S2, particles 1 and 2 could be both up (in term A) or one up and one down (in terms B and C).

Thus, in term A, S1·S2 has eigenvalue ħ²/4, and in terms B and C, S1·S2 has eigenvalue -3ħ²/4.

But wait, in the expectation value, I have to consider the entire state.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the action of S1·S2 on the entire state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the state psi is symmetric under the exchange of particles, so it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, since the state psi has two up and one down, the total spin S_total^2 can be determined.

If I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2, then I can find the expectation value of H.

Given that, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

As before, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We know that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ² each, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ².

So, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)

So, to find the expectation value of H, we need <psi| H |psi
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I've got this problem here about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and each Si is the spin operator for particle i. The state we're looking at is psi, which is 1/sqrt(3) times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H and, if so, what its energy is. If it's not, we need to find the expectation value of E.

First off, let me make sure I'm understanding the problem correctly. We have three spin-1/2 particles, so each can be either spin-up or spin-down. The state psi is symmetric in a way, but it's not all possible symmetric combinations. Let me write out the state more explicitly:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) * [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term is a product state where two spins are up and one is down. So, psi is a superposition of the three states where exactly two spins are up and one is down. That's interesting because in a system of three particles, each spin can independently be up or down, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. The state psi is a linear combination of three of those, specifically those with exactly two ups and one down.

Now, the Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of spin operators: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, H is proportional to the sum of the pairwise spin interactions. Each S_i·S_j is a scalar product, which can be expressed in terms of spin operators.

I recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be written as (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But another useful formula is that the total spin squared, (S_total)^2, is equal to S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2.

Wait, let me check that. If I have (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 gives: (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 all over 2. So, H = A*( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2. Hmm, that might be a useful way to express it.

Alternatively, since each S_i^2 for spin 1/2 particles is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So, S1^2 = 3/4 ħ^2, same for S2^2 and S3^2. Therefore, H can be rewritten as A*( (S_total)^2 - (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ħ^2 ) / 2. That is, H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ^2 ) / 2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I should consider the eigenstates of H. The eigenstates of H would be the states with definite total spin. So, if I can express psi in terms of total spin states, maybe that will help.

The total spin S_total can be S=2 (triplet states) or S=1 (singlet state). Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=3/2, S=1/2, depending on how the spins add up.

Wait, hold on. For two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin is either S=1 or S=0 (singlet and triplet). For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2. So, it's a bit more complicated.

But let me think about the state psi. It is symmetric in the sense that it has two spins up and one spin down. Let me consider the total spin of psi.

Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, let's compute the total spin for each term.

Wait, but each term is a product state, so their total spin is not directly obvious. Maybe I can calculate the total spin squared for each term and then see how psi behaves under H.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of H in the state psi without determining whether it's an eigenstate.

But the question specifically asks if it's an eigenstate or not, so maybe I need to check if H psi is proportional to psi.

Alternatively, maybe find the eigenstates of H and see if psi is one of them.

Given that H is a sum of pairwise interactions, it's related to the total spin. So, perhaps the eigenstates of H are the same as the eigenstates of S_total^2, which would be the states with definite total spin.

But wait, actually, H is a combination of S_total^2 and the individual S_i^2 terms, as I expressed earlier. So, if I can find a basis where S_total^2 is diagonal, then H will also be diagonal in that basis.

Given that, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it would also be an eigenstate of H. So, let's try to compute the total spin of psi.

To compute the total spin squared, I can use the formula S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/(A). Wait, no, wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = H/A.

Thus, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(H/A).

Therefore, rearranged, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2, as before.

But for each state, S_total^2 has eigenvalues s(s+1)ħ^2, where s is the total spin. So, for a given state, if I know s, then S_total^2 |psi> = s(s+1)ħ^2 |psi>.

Therefore, if I can compute S_total^2 |psi> and see if it equals s(s+1)ħ^2 |psi>, then perhaps I can relate this to H.

Alternatively, since H is a linear combination of S_i·S_j, which are spin operators, perhaps I can compute <psi|H|psi> by using the definition of H.

But maybe a better approach is to first compute the expectation value of H in psi, and then see if it's a single value, which would mean that H psi is proportional to psi, i.e., psi is an eigenstate.

So, to compute <H>, we can write it as A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>), where <S_i·S_j> is the expectation value of the dot product of spins i and j in the state psi.

So, let's compute each <S_i·S_j>.

But S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> is (1/4)(<S_i^+ S_j^-> + <S_i^- S_j^+>) + <S_i^z S_j^z>.

But calculating these expectation values requires knowing the action of the spin raising and lowering operators on the state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write S_i·S_j in terms of the spin operators' matrix elements.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since we know the state psi, maybe it's easier to compute <S_i·S_j> directly.

Let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators satisfy S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But maybe we can also recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

But in our case, the state is a combination of three particles. So, perhaps it's better to note that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can also be expressed as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2).

So, as I had before, H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (3*(3/4)ħ^2) ) / 2, since each S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

So, H = A*( S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2 ) / 2.

Therefore, if we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi, then we can compute the expectation value of H.

Thus, let me compute <psi|S_total^2|psi>.

Since S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But each S_i^2 has expectation value 3/4 ħ^2, since each particle is spin 1/2. So, <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = 3/4 ħ^2. Thus, the sum is 9/4 ħ^2.

Now, the other term is 2 times the sum of <S_i·S_j>, which is similar to what we need for H. So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2< H / A >.

Wait, no, wait. Because H = A*(sum of S_i·S_j). So, sum of S_i·S_j = H/A. Therefore, <sum of S_i·S_j> = <H>/A.

Thus, putting this together, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(<H>/A).

Therefore, <H> = A*( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ^2 ).

But if I can compute <S_total^2>, then I can find <H>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> another way. Since S_total^2 is the total spin squared, its expectation value is s(s + 1) ħ^2, where s is the total spin of the state psi.

So, if I can determine the total spin s of psi, then I can compute <S_total^2> as s(s + 1) ħ^2.

Therefore, perhaps I should determine whether psi is a singlet state, triplet state, or something else.

Wait, in three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, no, let me recall that. For three spin-1/2 particles: the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2. Because when you combine two spin-1/2 particles, you can get S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet). Then, combining a spin-1/2 with a spin-1 gives possible spins: 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, actually, I think the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles are S=3/2, S=1/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. Let's check whether it's symmetric under permutation of spins, or under some operations.

Wait, let's see: psi is symmetric in the sense that it treats all particles equally, but it's a superposition of all states with two spins up and one spin down. So, it's an eigenstate of the permutation group.

In particular, it is symmetric under permutation of particles, so it's in the symmetric subspace.

Given that, let me think about the total spin of psi.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin.

But the total spin S is determined by the combination of individual spins.

But perhaps it's difficult to see directly. Maybe another approach is to calculate the expectation value of S_z.

Wait, S_z is the total spin in the z-direction.

In psi, each term is a product of two ups and one down, so each term has S_z = (1/2)*2 - (1/2)*1 = 1/2.

But psi is a superposition of three such terms, each with S_z = 1/2.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_z> is (1/sqrt(3))^2 times the sum of (1/2) for each term. Therefore, <S_z> = (1/3)*(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) = (1/3)*(3/2) = 1/2. So, the expectation value of S_z is 1/2 ħ.

But wait, S_z is the total spin in the z-direction, so that gives us the expectation value. But S_z is not the same as the total spin S.

But since S_z is the eigenvalue corresponding to S_z, and the state psi must have a definite S_z, but not necessarily a definite S_total^2.

Therefore, even though <S_z> is 1/2 ħ, the state psi may not have a definite total spin.

But wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

If psi is in the S=1/2 subspace, then its <S_z> must be ( -1/2, -1/2 +1, or -1/2 +2 ) times ħ, that is, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, or 3/2 ħ.

Wait, but in our case, <S_z> is 1/2 ħ, which is within the possible eigenvalues for S=1/2: -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2 (but 3/2 corresponds to all spins up, which we don't have here). Wait, no, S=1/2 has possible m_s values of -1/2, +1/2.

Wait, no, the total spin S can be 1/2, with m_s = -1/2, +1/2, and S can also be 3/2 with m_s = -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2.

Wait, no, for spin 1/2, the total spin S can be 1/2 or 3/2. For S=1/2, the possible m_s are -1/2 and +1/2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2. For S=3/2, m_s can be -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2. For S=1/2, m_s can be -1/2, +1/2.

So, the possible m_s values are -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2, -1/2, +1/2. So, the <S_z> of 1/2 is possible for both S=1/2 and S=3/2.

Wait, but in our case, the state psi has <S_z> = 1/2 ħ. So, that is possible for both S=1/2 and S=3/2 states.

Therefore, we need another approach to figure out the total spin.

Perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2, which is s(s+1)ħ^2.

Alternatively, compute the expectation value of S_i^+ S_j^- for some i and j, which can help determine the total spin.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 in the state psi. Let me attempt that.

So, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

We already know that <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = 3/4 ħ^2.

So, the first three terms add up to 9/4 ħ^2.

Now, the remaining term is 2 times the sum of < S_i·S_j >.

But H is equal to A times that sum, so <H> = A * ( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ).

Therefore, <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> = <H>/A.

Therefore, the expectation value of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 is 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(<H>/A).

But I don't know <H> yet, so perhaps this approach is not helpful.

Wait, alternatively, let me compute <S1·S2> directly.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the spin dot product S1·S2 can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

But maybe it's better to compute <S1·S2> for the state |↑↑↓⟩, and then average over the state psi.

Wait, but since the state psi is a superposition of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩, which are the states with two ups and one down.

Wait, for each term, say |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

For |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

But when you compute S1·S2, which is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z), wait no, that's S1·S2 only in 3D.

Wait, no, sorry, S1·S2 is S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

Therefore, for the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 3/4 ħ^2.

Wait, but that's the expectation value? Wait, no, actually, it's the operator acting on the state.

Wait, no, perhaps I need to calculate the expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↑↓⟩, then multiply by the probability of being in that state.

Wait, let me try again.

In the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

The expectation value <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 3/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S3 = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 3/4 ħ^2.

Similarly for |↓↑↑⟩, S2·S3 = 3/4 ħ^2.

But wait, hold on, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps not. Because when computing S1·S2 in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value is actually ( (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) ) times ħ^2, but actually, no.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to note that for two spins up, S1·S2 is ( (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) ) times ħ^2, but that seems high.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing things.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles in |↑↑⟩, S1·S2 = ( (1/2)(1/2) ) in each component? Wait, no. Let me compute S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩.

Compute (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) acting on |↑↑⟩.

We have S1^z |↑↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ)|↑↑⟩, same for S2^z.

Similarly, S1^x and S1^y, as lowering and raising operators, but for |↑↑⟩, S1^+ |↑↑⟩ = 0 and S1^- |↑↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↓⟩, but since the second spin is also up, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

In the state |↑↑⟩, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑⟩ = S1^+ |↑⟩ |↑⟩ = 0, since S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0. Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩, which is (1/2 ħ)|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, (S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) |↑↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, the first term in S1·S2 is (1/2)(1/2) ħ^2 times the projection onto |↑↓⟩, but since |↑↑⟩ is orthogonal to |↑↓⟩, the expectation value is zero.

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) ħ^2 |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↑⟩ is 0 + (1/2)(1/2) ħ^2 = 1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.

Wait, so more carefully: S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

When acting on |↑↑⟩, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑⟩ = 0, as S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑⟩ = S1^- |↑⟩ |↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↓⟩ |↑⟩.

But since |↑↑⟩ is orthogonal to |↓↑⟩, the term S1^- S2^+ |↑↑⟩ is orthogonal to |↑↑⟩, so the expectation value is zero.

Therefore, the expectation value of the first part is zero.

The second part is S1^z S2^z |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) ħ^2 |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/4) ħ^2.

Similarly, for the other terms in the state psi.

But wait, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acting on it is (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩, as we saw, and S1·S3 would be (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ as well, because S1^z S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩, and the other terms would vanish because of orthogonality.

Wait, actually, in |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩, because only the S1^z S2^z term remains, and the other terms don't contribute because the state is orthogonal to the states where a spin is flipped.

Similarly, S1·S3 = (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩, because S1^z S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩, and the other terms vanish.

Wait, so S1·S2 + S1·S3 in |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 1/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, for each term in psi, each of the three pairwise dot products contributes (1/2) ħ^2.

Wait, let me confirm.

In |↑↑↓⟩:

S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩,

S1·S3 = (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩,

S2·S3 = (S2^z S3^z) = (-1/2)(-1/2) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, wait, no, in |↑↑↓⟩, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2. So, S2^z S3^z = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, the expectation value of S2·S3 is (1/2)(-1/2) ħ^2 = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but hold on, S2·S3 is (S2^x S3^x + S2^y S3^y + S2^z S3^z). So, for |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value of S2^x S3^x is zero, because |↑↑↓⟩ is orthogonal to |↑↓↑⟩, which is the state where S2 flips to down. Similarly for S2^y S3^y, the expectation is zero. So, only S2^z S3^z contributes, which is (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, <S2·S3> in |↑↑↓⟩ is -1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, for each term in psi:

|↑↑↓⟩:

<S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2,

<S1·S3> = 1/4 ħ^2,

<S2·S3> = -1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, |↑↓↑⟩:

<S1·S2> = -1/4 ħ^2,

<S1·S3> = 1/4 ħ^2,

<S2·S3> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, |↓↑↑⟩:

<S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2,

<S1·S3> = -1/4 ħ^2,

<S2·S3> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, in each of the three basis states of psi, each pairwise dot product contributes either +1/4 or -1/4 ħ^2.

So, the expectation value of (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) for the state psi is the sum over the three terms, each contributing their respective expectation values.

So, in |↑↑↓⟩, the sum is 1/4 + 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, it's -1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/4 ħ^2.

In |↓↑↑⟩, it's 1/4 - 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

Thus, <H> = A * (3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, but according to the correct answer, it should be 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, either I made a mistake in the calculation, or the correct answer is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the expectation values.

Wait, in |↑↑↓⟩, <S1·S2> is 1/4 ħ^2, <S1·S3> is 1/4 ħ^2, and <S2·S3> is -1/4 ħ^2, so the sum is 1/4 + 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Similarly for the other terms. So, each term in psi gives an expectation of 1/4 ħ^2, and since psi is a symmetric combination of these three terms with equal coefficients, the total expectation value is 1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, but hold on, the state psi is 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ). So, when we compute <H>, it's A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ).

But in each of the three basis states, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is 1/4, -1/4, and 1/4 respectively? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought each basis state gives 1/4, but in |↑↑↓⟩, the sum is 1/4, in |↑↓↑⟩, the sum is -1/4, and in |↓↑↑⟩, the sum is 1/4.

Wait, actually, for |↑↑↓⟩:

<S1·S2> = 1/4,

<S1·S3> = 1/4,

<S2·S3> = -1/4,

so total sum: 1/4 + 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩:

<S1·S2> = -1/4,

<S1·S3> = 1/4,

<S2·S3> = 1/4,

sum: -1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/4.

Same for |↓↑↑⟩:

<S1·S2> = 1/4,

<S1·S3> = -1/4,

<S2·S3> = 1/4,

sum: 1/4 - 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/4.

Therefore, each of the three basis states gives an expectation value of 1/4 ħ^2 for the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Since psi is an equal superposition of these three states, the total expectation value is 1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, <H> = A*(1/4) ħ^2 = (A/4) ħ^2.

But wait, the correct answer was supposed to be 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, so either the correct answer is wrong, or my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in how I compute the expectation values. Let me try a different approach.

Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the singlet state is -3/4 ħ^2, and in the triplet states, it's 1/2 ħ^2 or something else?

Wait, no, actually, for two spins, the singlet state has S1·S2 = - (3/4) ħ^2.

The triplet states (with S=1) have S1·S2 = ( (1)(1+1) - (1/2)(1/2 +1) - (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ^2. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, for S=1, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

So, for S=1, S1·S2 = (2(2+1) - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2 * ħ^2.

Which is (6 - 3/2) / 2 = (9/2)/2 = 9/4 / 2 = 9/8? Wait, no, 6 - 3/2 is 4.5, 4.5 / 2 is 2.25, which is 9/4. Therefore, S1·S2 = 9/4 ħ^2? No, wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

The expectation value of S1·S2 in the singlet state is -3/4 ħ^2, and in each of the triplet states, it's 1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, let me verify this. For the
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The spin state is provided as psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find its energy. If not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall that the dot product of spin operators, S_i·S_j, can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared. The formula is S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So, maybe I can rewrite H in terms of S_total squared.

Given that, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) can be rewritten as H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 + S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 ) / 3 ). Wait, no, that seems off. Let me try again.

Actually, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be written as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all over 2. Because expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, rearranging, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, substituting back into H, H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Similarly for S2^2 and S3^2. So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ). Simplifying, H = (A/2)*S_total^2 - (9/8)A ħ².

Now, if I can determine S_total^2 for the given state psi, then I can compute H. Let's figure out the total spin squared for psi.

Looking at psi, it's a symmetric state under permutation of particles with two up spins and one down spin. So, the state is symmetric in spin space. That suggests that the total spin S_total might be higher than 1/2, but I need to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

Another approach is to note that for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be either S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. Since our state is symmetric, it must be in the S=3/2 multiplet, right? Because symmetric states under exchange of spins typically correspond to higher total spins.

But wait, no, that's not necessarily always true. For example, the singlet state is antisymmetric, and for three particles, the spin state might have a different symmetry. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the given state is symmetric under particle exchange, as swapping any two particles doesn't change the state. So, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin states are those with S=3/2. Because the antisymmetric spin states would have S=1/2, but I think for three particles, the situation is different.

Wait, actually, for two particles, symmetric spin states correspond to S=1, and antisymmetric correspond to S=0. For three particles, the situation is more complicated. The total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. However, whether a state is symmetric or antisymmetric depends on how the spin states are combined.

But in this case, the state psi is symmetric, so maybe it's a part of the symmetric subspace, which would correspond to S=3/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S_total^2 for psi.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/(A).

Wait, from the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = H/A. Therefore, S_total^2 = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(H/A).

So, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²).

Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi, I can compute H.

So, let me compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

But how? Maybe I can use the fact that S_total^2 for a state with total spin S is S(S+1)ħ². So, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then S_total^2 |psi> = [S(S+1)ħ²] |psi>.

But I need to confirm if psi is in the S=3/2 multiplet. If so, then S_total^2 |psi> would be (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = (15/4)ħ².

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Since S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is the same as S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/A.

But perhaps it's easier to compute S_total^2 on psi by using the fact that for spin 1/2 particles, the total spin squared can be calculated by summing the squares and twice the dot products.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for psi.

Given the state psi is a sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, down1 up2 up3.

Each term has two up spins and one down spin. Let's compute S_total^2 for each term and then average them.

But S_total^2 acting on a term like up1 up2 down3 can be computed as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |up up down>.

Expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S_total^2 acting on |up up down> is:

(S1^2 |up up down> + S2^2 |up up down> + S3^2 |up up down>) + 2(S1·S2 |up up down> + S1·S3 |up up down> + S2·S3 |up up down>).

Each S_i^2 acting on a spin up or down state will give 3/4 ħ², since S_i^2 for spin 1/2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

So, S1^2 |up up down> = 3/4 ħ² |up up down>, same for S2^2 and S3^2. Therefore, the first part is 3*(3/4 ħ²) |up up down> = (9/4 ħ²) |up up down>.

Now, for the dot products: S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

Let me compute S1·S2 |up up down>.

S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

So, S1·S2 |up up> = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z) |up up>.

Since both spins are up, S_z components are ħ/2. So S1_z S2_z |up up> = (ħ/2)^2 |up up>.

For the x and y components, S1_x and S2_x are lowering and raising operators. Applying S1_x to |up> gives (ħ/2)(|down> + |up>), but wait, no: actually, S_x for spin 1/2 is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix, which is (|up><down| + |down><up|)/2. So, S1_x |up> = (ħ/2)|down> and S1_x |down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

Wait, actually, S1_x |up> = (ħ/2)|down> and S1_x |down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

So, S1_x S2_x |up up> would be (ħ/2)^2 (|down><down| + |down><up| + |up><down| + |up><up|). Wait, no, more accurately, S1_x S2_x acts on |up up> as S1_x |up> ⊗ S2_x |up> = (ħ/2 |down>) ⊗ (ħ/2 |down>) = ħ²/4 |down down>.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |up up> = (S1_y |up>) ⊗ (S2_y |up>). S_y for spin 1/2 is ħ/2 times the imaginary Pauli matrix, which is (|up><down| - |down><up|)/2i. So, S_y |up> = -i (ħ/2)|down>.

Therefore, S1_y S2_y |up up> = ( -i ħ/2 |down> ) ⊗ ( -i ħ/2 |down> ) = ( -i )^2 (ħ²/4) |down down> = (-1) (ħ²/4)|down down>.

Similarly, S1_z S2_z |up up> = (ħ/2)^2 |up up>.

So, putting it all together, S1·S2 |up up> = (ħ²/4)|down down> + (-ħ²/4)|down down> + (ħ²/4)|up up> = (ħ²/4)(|down down> - |down down> + |up up>) = (ħ²/4)|up up>.

Wait, let me recheck that:

Wait, S1_x S2_x |up up> = (ħ²/4)|down down>.

S1_y S2_y |up up> = ( -i ħ/2 |down> ) ⊗ ( -i ħ/2 |down> ) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |down down> = ( -1 * ħ²/4 ) |down down>.

S1_z S2_z |up up> = (ħ²/4)|up up>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |up up> = (ħ²/4)|down down> + (-ħ²/4)|down down> + (ħ²/4)|up up> = 0 + (ħ²/4)|up up> = (ħ²/4)|up up>.

Wait, that seems too simplistic. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, when you compute S1·S2 |up up>, it's (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z)|up up>.

Which is (S1_x |up>)(S2_x |up>) + (S1_y |up>)(S2_y |up>) + (S1_z |up>)(S2_z |up>).

As we saw, S1_x |up> = (ħ/2)|down>, S2_x |up> = (ħ/2)|down>.

Similarly, S1_y |up> = (-iħ/2)|down>, S2_y |up> = (-iħ/2)|down>.

And S1_z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, same for S2_z.

So, computing each term:

(S1_x S2_x |up up>) = (ħ/2 |down>)⊗(ħ/2 |down>) = ħ²/4 |down down>.

(S1_y S2_y |up up>) = (-iħ/2 |down>)⊗(-iħ/2 |down>) = (i²)(ħ²/4)|down down> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|down down>.

(S1_z S2_z |up up>) = (ħ/2 |up>)⊗(ħ/2 |up>) = ħ²/4 |up up>.

Adding them up: (ħ²/4)|down down> + (-ħ²/4)|down down> + (ħ²/4)|up up> = 0 + (ħ²/4)|up up> = (ħ²/4)|up up>.

So, S1·S2 |up up> = (ħ²/4)|up up>.

Similarly, what is S1·S3 |up up down>?

Well, S1·S3 = S1_x S3_x + S1_y S3_y + S1_z S3_z.

Let's compute each term:

First, S1_z S3_z |up up down> = (ħ/2 |up>)⊗(ħ/2 |down>) = ħ²/4 |up down>.

Similarly, S1_x S3_x |up up down> = (ħ/2 |down>)⊗(ħ/2 |up>) = ħ²/4 |down up>.

S1_y S3_y |up up down> = ( -iħ/2 |down> )⊗( -iħ/2 |up> ) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |down up> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|down up>.

Therefore, S1·S3 |up up down> = (ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|down up> + (-ħ²/4)|down up> = (ħ²/4)|up down> + 0 = (ħ²/4)|up down>.

Similarly, S2·S3 |up up down>:

This is similar to S1·S3, but with S2 and S3:

S2_z S3_z |up up down> = (ħ/2 |up>)⊗(ħ/2 |down>) = ħ²/4 |up down>.

S2_x S3_x |up up down> = (ħ/2 |down>)⊗(ħ/2 |up>) = ħ²/4 |down up>.

S2_y S3_y |up up down> = (-iħ/2 |down>)⊗(-iħ/2 |up>) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |down up> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|down up>.

So, S2·S3 |up up down> = (ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|down up> + (-ħ²/4)|down up> = (ħ²/4)|up down> + 0 = (ħ²/4)|up down>.

So, putting it all together, when S_total^2 acts on |up up down>, it gives:

(9/4 ħ²) |up up down> + 2*(S1·S2 |up up down> + S1·S3 |up up down> + S2·S3 |up up down>).

From above, S1·S2 |up up down> = (ħ²/4)|up up>, S1·S3 |up up down> = (ħ²/4)|up down>, S2·S3 |up up down> = (ħ²/4)|up down>.

Therefore, the cross terms sum to 2*( (ħ²/4)|up up> + (ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|up down> ) = 2*( ħ²/4 (|up up> + |up down> + |up down>) ) = ħ²/2 (|up up> + 2|up down>).

So, S_total^2 |up up down> = (9/4 ħ²) |up up down> + (ħ²/2)(|up up> + 2|up down>).

Wait, but |up up down> is a basis state, and |up up> and |up down> are different basis states. So, how does this act on |up up down>?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.

Wait, when I compute S_total^2 |up up down>, it's a linear combination of basis states, but S_total^2 is an operator, so it should act on |up up down> and produce another state.

But in our calculation above, S_total^2 |up up down> = (9/4 ħ²) |up up down> + (ħ²/2)|up up> + ħ² |up down>.

Wait, so that's (9/4 ħ²)|up up down> + (ħ²/2)|up up> + ħ² |up down>.

But |up up down> is orthogonal to |up up> and |up down>, so we can take the expectation value by projecting onto |up up down>.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

But since psi is a sum of three states, each with two up and one down, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

Let me compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

Since psi is (|up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>)/sqrt(3).

So, <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> + <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> + <up up down| S_total^2 |down up up> + similar terms for the other states ].

But because of the symmetry of the state, each cross term will be the same.

Wait, but since S_total^2 is a scalar operator, the expectation value is the same for each basis state in the sum.

But wait, let me compute each term.

First, <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> = <up up down| [9/4 ħ² |up up down> + ħ²/2 |up up> + ħ² |up down> ].

So, this expectation value is 9/4 ħ² + 0 + 0, because |up up down> is orthogonal to |up up> and |up down>.

Similarly, <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> = <up up down| [9/4 ħ² |up down up> + ... ].

But wait, when S_total^2 acts on |up down up>, what is it?

Wait, let me compute S_total^2 |up down up> similarly.

So, S_total^2 |up down up> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |up down up> = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) |up down up> + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |up down up>.

Each S_i^2 |up down up> is 3/4 ħ² |up down up>.

So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 acting on |up down up> gives 3*(3/4 ħ²)|up down up> = 9/4 ħ² |up down up>.

Now, compute 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |up down up>.

Compute S1·S2 |up down up>:

S1·S2 |up down> = (ħ²/4)|up up> + (-ħ²/4)|up down> as before.

Wait, actually, let me think.

Wait, to compute S1·S2 |up down up>, similar to earlier.

Express S1·S2 |up down>:

Wait, but in |up down up>, the third spin is up. So, S1·S2 acts on the first two spins, and S1·S3 and S2·S3 act on the first and third, and second and third spins.

So, S1·S2 |up down up> = (S1·S2) |up down> |up> = ?

Wait, no, it's a three-spin state, so S1·S2 acts on the first two spins.

So, |up down up> can be written as |up down> |up>.

So, S1·S2 |up down> |up> = (S1·S2 |up down>) |up> = [ (S1·S2)|up down> ] |up>.

From earlier, S1·S2 |up down> = (ħ²/4)(|up down> - |down up> + |up up>)/something? Wait, no.

Wait, earlier when computing S1·S2 |up up>, we saw that S1·S2 |up up> = ħ²/4 |up up>.

But for S1·S2 |up down>, let's compute it.

S1·S2 |up down> = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z) |up down>.

S1_z S2_z |up down> = (ħ/2)^2 |up down> = ħ²/4 |up down>.

S1_x S2_x |up down> = (ħ/2 |down>)⊗(ħ/2 |up>) = ħ²/4 |down up>.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |up down> = ( -iħ/2 |down> )⊗( -iħ/2 |up> ) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |down up> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|down up>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |up down> = (ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|down up> + (-ħ²/4)|down up> = (ħ²/4)|up down>.

Similarly, S1·S3 |up down up>: let's compute that.

S1·S3 = S1·S3.

So, |up down up> = |up> |down> |up>.

So, S1·S3 |up> |down> |up> = S1·S3 |up> |down> |up>.

Compute each component:

S1_z S3_z |up> |down> |up> = (ħ/2 |up>) (ħ/2 |down>) (ħ/2 |up>) = (ħ²/4) |up down up>.

S1_x S3_x |up> |down> |up> = (ħ/2 |down>) (ħ/2 |up>) (ħ/2 |up>) = (ħ²/4) |down up up>.

S1_y S3_y |up> |down> |up> = ( -iħ/2 |down> ) ( -iħ/2 |up> ) (ħ/2 |up>) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |down up up> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|down up up>.

Therefore, S1·S3 |up down up> = (ħ²/4)|up down up> + (ħ²/4)|down up up> + (-ħ²/4)|down up up> = (ħ²/4)|up down up>.

Similarly, S2·S3 |up down up>:

Since S2 acts on the second spin, which is down, and S3 acts on the third spin, which is up.

So, S2·S3 |down> |up> = S2·S3 |down> |up>.

Compute each component:

S2_z S3_z |down> |up> = ( -ħ/2 |down> ) ( ħ/2 |up> ) = (-ħ²/4) |down up>.

S2_x S3_x |down> |up> = ( -ħ/2 |up> ) ( ħ/2 |down> ) = (-ħ²/4)|up down>.

S2_y S3_y |down> |up> = ( -iħ/2 |up> ) ( -iħ/2 |down> ) = ( (-i)^2 ħ²/4 ) |up down> = (-1)(ħ²/4)|up down>.

Therefore, S2·S3 |up down up> = (-ħ²/4)|down up> + (-ħ²/4)|up down> + (-ħ²/4)|up down>.

So, S2·S3 |up down up> = (-ħ²/4)(|down up> + 2|up down>).

Putting it all together, 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |up down up> = 2*( (ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|up down up> + (-ħ²/4)(|down up> + 2|up down>) ).

Simplify:

2*( ħ²/4 |up down> + ħ²/4 |up down up> - ħ²/4 |down up> - ħ²/2 |up down> )

= 2*( (ħ²/4 - ħ²/2)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|up down up> - (ħ²/4)|down up> )

= 2*( (-ħ²/4)|up down> + (ħ²/4)|up down up> - (ħ²/4)|down up> )

= (-ħ²/2)|up down> + (ħ²/2)|up down up> - (ħ²/2)|down up>.

So, altogether, S_total^2 |up down up> = (9/4 ħ²)|up down up> + (-ħ²/2)|up down> + (ħ²/2)|up down up> - (ħ²/2)|down up>.

Wait, no, because S_total^2 |up down up> = (9/4 ħ²)|up down up> + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|up down up>.

From above, 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|up down up> = (-ħ²/2)|up down> + (ħ²/2)|up down up> - (ħ²/2)|down up>.

Therefore, S_total^2 |up down up> = (9/4 ħ²)|up down up> + (-ħ²/2)|up down> + (ħ²/2)|up down up> - (ħ²/2)|down up>.

Combine like terms:

(9/4 + 1/2) ħ² |up down up> - (1/2) ħ² |up down> - (1/2) ħ² |down up>.

Convert 9/4 + 1/2 = 9/4 + 2/4 = 11/4.

So, S_total^2 |up down up> = (11/4 ħ²)|up down up> - (1/2 ħ²)(|up down> + |down up>).

Similarly, if I compute S_total^2 |down up up>, by symmetry, it should be the same expression with |up down> replaced by |down up>.

Wait, no, |down up up> is the same as |up down up> with first and second spins swapped, so perhaps similar terms.

But in any case, let me try computing <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up>.

This is <up up down| [9/4 ħ² |up down up> - (1/2 ħ²)(|up down> + |down up>)].

Wait, but |up up down> is orthogonal to |up down up>, |up down>, and |down up>, so the expectation value is zero?

Wait, no, because S_total^2 |up down up> includes a component of |up down up> and |up down> and |down up>. So, projecting |up up down> onto S_total^2 |up down up> gives zero because |up up down> is orthogonal to |up down up> and also orthogonal to |up down> and |down up>.

Similarly, all cross terms in <psi| S_total^2 |psi> will be zero because different basis states are orthogonal.

Therefore, the only contribution comes from the diagonal terms.

So, <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> + <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> + <up up down| S_total^2 |down up up> + ... ].

But since all cross terms are zero, this reduces to (1/3) [ <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> + <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> + <up up down| S_total^2 |down up up> + ... ].

But each of these terms is either <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> = 9/4 ħ², or <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> = 0, etc.

Wait, but for the cross terms, like <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up>, which is <up up down| (9/4 ħ² |up down up> - ħ²/2 |up down> - ħ²/2 |down up> ).

But |up up down> is orthogonal to |up down up>, |up down>, and |down up>, so this inner product is zero.

Similarly, <up up down| S_total^2 |down up up> = 0.

Similarly, the other diagonal terms:

<up down up| S_total^2 |up up down> = 0, because |up down up> is orthogonal to |up up down>.

Same for <down up up| S_total^2 |up up down> = 0.

Wait, but hold on, when I compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>, it's actually the sum over all combinations. Let me write it more carefully.

<psi| S_total^2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> + <up up down| S_total^2 |up down up> + <up up down| S_total^2 |down up up> + <up down up| S_total^2 |up up down> + <up down up| S_total^2 |up down up> + <up down up| S_total^2 |down up up> + <down up up| S_total^2 |up up down> + <down up up| S_total^2 |up down up> + <down up up| S_total^2 |down up up> ].

As I said, each of these cross terms is zero because different basis states are orthogonal.

Therefore, only the diagonal terms survive, which are:

<up up down| S_total^2 |up up down> = 9/4 ħ²,

<up down up| S_total^2 |up down up> = 11/4 ħ²,

<down up up| S_total^2 |down up up> = 11/4 ħ².

Wait, why is <up down up| S_total^2 |up down up> = 11/4 ħ²?

Wait, earlier when we computed S_total^2 |up down up>, we got (11/4 ħ²)|up down up> - (1/2 ħ²)(|up down> + |down up>).

But when taking the expectation value <up down up| S_total^2 |up down up>, we get 11/4 ħ².

Similarly, for |down up up>, it's the same.

Therefore, each diagonal term contributes 9/4 ħ², 11/4 ħ², and 11/4 ħ².

So, the total is (1/3)(9/4 + 11/4 + 11/4) ħ² = (1/3)( (9 + 11 + 11)/4 ) ħ² = (1/3)(31/4) ħ² = 31/12 ħ².

Wait, 9 + 11 + 11 is 31? 9 + 11 is 20 + 11 is 31, yes.

So, <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = 31/12 ħ².

Wait, but wait, that can't be because the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles are 3/2 or 1/2.

If it's an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it should have S_total^2 = (S(S+1)) ħ².

But 31/12 is not an integer divided by 4. Wait, 31/12 is approximately 2.583, which is not 3/2(5/2)=15/4=3.75 or 1/2(3/2)=3/4=0.75.

So, that suggests that the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, which would imply that it's not an eigenstate of H.

But wait, the correct answer says it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3 A ħ². So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine the computation of <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

I had:

<psi| S_total^2 |psi> = (1/3)( <uuu| S_total^2 |uuu> + <uud| S_total^2 |uud> + <udu| S_total^2 |udu> )

But I thought that each basis state |uuu>, |uud>, |udu> are orthogonal, so we can compute each expectation value separately.

Wait, no, actually, in our case, the state psi is a sum of three states: |uud>, |udu>, |duu>, each appearing once.

So, psi = 1/sqrt(3) (|uud> + |udu> + |duu>).

Therefore, to compute <psi| S_total^2 |
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I've got this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. I need to figure out if the given spin state is an eigenfunction of H and, if so, find its energy. If not, I have to calculate the expectation value of the energy. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). 

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, each S_i is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices for each particle. But maybe I don't need to get into the matrix representation right away. Instead, perhaps I can use some properties of spin states and operators.

I know that the dot product of spin operators, like S_i·S_j, can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. That might be helpful because the Hamiltonian is a sum of these dot products.

So, for each term S_i·S_j, I can rewrite them as (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. Then, the Hamiltonian becomes H = A*( (S1·S2) + (S1·S3) + (S2·S3) ) = A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 ] + [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 ] + [ (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ] ).

Let me compute that. First, combining the terms:

Each S_i·S_j term contributes (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So when I sum them up, each S_total^2 term is added three times, each S_i^2 term is subtracted three times. Specifically, the sum becomes:

H = A*( (3 S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2 )

Wait, let me check:

Each S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 gives (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2, etc. So each of the three terms would have S_total^2, so 3 S_total^2, and then each S_i^2 appears in the denominators for each term it's involved in. Since each S_i is in two terms, each S_i^2 is subtracted twice. So total:

H = A*( (3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2 )

Wait, hold on. Let me actually compute it step by step.

The first term: S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2

Second term: S1·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2

Third term: S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Adding these three terms together:

Total = [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2) + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2) + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2) ] / 2

So numerator is 3 S_total^2 - 2 S1^2 - 2 S2^2 - 2 S3^2

Therefore, H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2

But I also know that for spin-1/2 particles, S1^2 = (ħ/2)(ħ/2 + 1) = (3/4) ħ^2

Wait, actually, S_i^2 for spin 1/2 is (ħ^2)(s(s+1)) where s=1/2, so that would be (3/4)ħ^2 for each particle. So each S_i^2 is 3/4 ħ^2.

So S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4 ħ^2) = 9/4 ħ^2

So plugging back into H:

H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 2*(9/4 ħ^2))/2

Simplify:

First, compute 2*(9/4 ħ^2) = 9/2 ħ^2

Then, 3 S_total^2 - 9/2 ħ^2

Then, divide by 2, so H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 9/2 ħ^2)/2 = A*(3 S_total^2)/2 - A*(9/2 ħ^2)/2 = (3 A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A/4) ħ^2

But I think another approach is perhaps more straightforward. Since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, its eigenvalues are known for different total spin states. Since we have three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 or 1/2. 

Wait, how do we get the total spin here? The state psi is a symmetric state under permutation of the spins, isn't it? Let me look at the state: it's a sum of terms where each term has two up spins and one down spin. So each term is like up, up, down in some order. So it's symmetric under permutation of the spins.

But wait, hold on: the state is 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). So yes, it's symmetric under swapping any two particles. Therefore, this state is in the symmetric subspace.

Now, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=3/2 or S=1/2. The symmetric states would include the S=3/2 state and the symmetric part of the S=1/2 states. But actually, the symmetric states are the sum of all symmetric states with different spins.

Wait, but I might need to figure out whether the given state is in the S=3/2 subspace or S=1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the state has total spin S=1/2. Because each term in the state has two up spins and one down spin. Let me think: if two spins are up and one down, then the total spin projection is 1/2 (since each up is +1/2, so 2*(1/2) + (-1/2) = 1/2). So the state has a total spin projection of 1/2, but is it an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Hmm, maybe I can compute S_total^2 acting on the state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to evaluate the expectation value of H, but wait, H is expressed in terms of S_total^2 and S_i^2. So perhaps I can compute the expectation value of H by finding the expectation values of S_total^2 and S_i^2.

So, since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and I can write that in terms of S_total^2, as before:

H = A*( (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ) = A*( (3 S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2 )

So if I can compute <psi|S_total^2|psi> and <psi|S1^2|psi>, I can find the expectation value of H.

First, let's compute <S_total^2>. Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/(A). Therefore, H = (A/2)(3 S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))

Wait, but we already did that earlier. Alternatively, from the expression for H, we can write S_total^2 as follows:

From H = (A/2)(3 S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)), we can solve for S_total^2:

H = (3 A / 2) S_total^2 - (A / 2)(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)

But since S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = (3)(3/4 ħ^2) = 9/4 ħ^2, as before.

So H = (3 A / 2) S_total^2 - (A / 2)(9/4 ħ^2)

So rearranged, S_total^2 = (2 H / (3 A)) + (9/8 ħ^2)

Therefore, if I can find <psi|H|psi>, I can find <psi|S_total^2|psi> and then get H from that.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, and the state psi is in a specific multiplet (either S=3/2 or S=1/2), the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is known.

So perhaps I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

Looking at psi, as I mentioned, each term has two spins up and one spin down. So the state is a combination of states with total spin z-projection of 1/2. But is it an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The symmetric state (which this is, since it's symmetric under particle exchange) must have total spin either 3/2 or a combination of 1/2 and 3/2. But wait, actually, the symmetric subspace includes both S=3/2 and S=1/2. The singlet state for three particles is a combination of different symmetries, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states are the S=3/2 and the symmetric part of S=1/2.

Wait, actually, the total Hilbert space for three spin-1/2 particles is 2^3 = 8 dimensional. The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional because the symmetric states are those with even number of spin flips. But for three particles, the symmetric subspace is four dimensions: the triplet (S=3/2) and three singlets, but actually, wait: no, for spin-1/2 particles, adding three together, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The 3/2 spin has a 4-dimensional representation (since 2S+1 = 4), and the 1/2 spin has a 2-dimensional representation. But the symmetric subspace would include some of these.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of group theory. The symmetric group S3 acts on the spin states, and the totally symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional. So the state psi we have is a symmetric state, and it must lie within that 4-dimensional symmetric subspace. Now, the 4-dimensional symmetric subspace consists of the S=3/2 quartet and the symmetric S=1/2 doublet. Because the S=3/2 is symmetric, and the S=1/2 is also symmetric under exchange, but as a doublet. So the symmetric subspace is the direct sum of S=3/2 and the symmetric S=1/2.

But our state psi is a symmetric state with two up spins and one down spin. So it's in the S=1/2 subspace? Because each term has two up and one down, which would have total spin S=1/2.

Wait, perhaps not necessarily. Wait, when you have three spin-1/2 particles, the states with two up and one down can have total spin either S=3/2 or S=1/2. How is that?

Wait, for two up and one down, the possible total spins are:

If the down spin is in a single-particle state, and the two up spins are in a triplet, then adding a down spin to the triplet can give total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of coupling: first couple two spins to make S=1/2 or S=3/2, then add the third spin.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for the state psi.

Since S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2H/(A)

So S_total^2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2*(H)/(A)

Thus, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))

But wait, that's the same as before.

So, if I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2, I can compute H.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of H directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so the expectation value of H is A*(<psi|S1·S2|psi> + <psi|S1·S3|psi> + <psi|S2·S3|psi> )

So, let me compute each term.

First, compute <psi|S1·S2|psi>

Similarly, compute <psi|S1·S3|psi> and <psi|S2·S3|psi>

But maybe it's easier to use the fact that <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(<psi| (S_i + S_j)^2 |psi> - <psi| S_i^2 |psi> - <psi| S_j^2 |psi> )

So, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(<S_i + S_j>^2 - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> )

So, compute <S_i + S_j>^2 and <S_i^2> and <S_j^2>

But wait, <S_i + S_j>^2 is the square of the expectation value of S_i + S_j. But wait, the state psi is a symmetric state in the three spins, so the expectation value of S_i + S_j is zero? Or not necessarily.

Wait, no, because in the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So for each term in psi, the sum S1 + S2 has a certain expectation value.

Wait, maybe it's better to actually compute the expectation value of S_i + S_j.

Let me think.

Each spin operator S_i acts on each particle. The state psi is symmetric, so perhaps the expectation value of S_i + S_j can be computed.

Wait, but wait, to compute <psi|S_i + S_j|psi>, we can note that S_i + S_j = S_i^{(i)} + S_j^{(j)}.

But since the state is symmetric under permutation, maybe the expectation value is the same for any i and j.

So, let's fix i=1, j=2.

Compute <psi|S1 + S2|psi> = sum_{a,b,c} [ (1/sqrt(3)) (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3) ]^* [ (S1 + S2) acting on each term ]

Wait, this might be complicated because S1 and S2 are spin operators, so they act on their respective particles.

Alternatively, since S_i acts on particle i, and the state is |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3>, normalized.

So, let's write S1 as (ħ/2) σ1, where σ1 are the Pauli matrices for particle 1. Similarly for S2 and S3.

But since each term in psi is a product of states, perhaps we can compute the expectation value term by term.

Let me compute <psi| S1 + S2 |psi>:

Since S1 and S2 act on different particles, and the state is a linear combination of product states, the expectation value can be written as the sum over the terms of the product of the expectation values.

So, expanding |psi>:

|psi> = 1/sqrt(3) [ |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ]

So, <psi| S1 + S2 |psi> = 1/3 [ <up1 up2 down3| + <up1 down2 up3| + <down1 up2 up3| ] * [ (S1 + S2) |up1 up2 down3> + (S1 + S2) |up1 down2 up3> + (S1 + S2) |down1 up2 up3> ]

Now, compute (S1 + S2) acting on each term.

First term: (S1 + S2) |up1 up2 down3>

S1 acts on the first qubit, which is up. S1|up> = (ħ/2)|down>, since S_z|up> = +1/2 ħ |up> and S_z|down> = -1/2 ħ |down>. Wait, actually, S_i has three components: S_x, S_y, S_z.

Wait, but in the expression (S1 + S2), it's the vector sum, so it's S1_x + S1_y + S1_z + S2_x + S2_y + S2_z.

But perhaps I can compute each component.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each term, (S1 + S2) will act on the first and second qubits, leaving the third qubit untouched.

So, let me write each term.

First, compute (S1 + S2) acting on |up1 up2 down3>:

= S1|up1> ⊗ |up2> + |up1> ⊗ S2|up2> ⊗ |down3>

Similarly, compute each operator:

S1|up1> = (ħ/2)|down1>, since S_z|up> = +ħ/2 |up>

Wait, no: S_z|up> = (+1/2 ħ)|up>, so S1|up> = (ħ/2)|down> ?

Wait, no, S_z|up> = (+1/2 ħ)|up>, S_z|down> = (-1/2 ħ)|down>. So S1|up> would flip the spin to |down> with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, actually, no, S1 is the spin operator for particle 1. So S1|up1> = (ħ/2)|down1> ?

No, perhaps not. Wait, I think when you act on |up>, S_z|up> = (+1/2 ħ)|up>, but S_x|up> = (ħ/2)|down>, and S_y|up> = i (ħ/2)|down>. Wait, actually, S_i has components, but S1 is a vector operator. So (S1 + S2) acting on |up1 up2 down3> is (S1|up1>) ⊗ |up2> + |up1> ⊗ S2|up2> + |up1> ⊗ |up2> ⊗ (S3|down3>)

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of computing it directly, I can compute the expectation value.

Wait, but this seems getting too involved for a manual calculation. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me recall that the state psi is symmetric, so the expectation value of S1·S2 is the same as S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Also, considering that the state is in the subspace of symmetric states, and perhaps the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be found by considering the total spin.

Alternatively, since H is a sum of pairwise spins, maybe I can use the fact that for a state with total spin S, the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is (S(S+1) - 3/2) ħ^2. Wait, is that right?

Wait, let's recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2

Therefore, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = [ <S_total^2> - <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> ] / 2

Given that each S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ^2, so <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 3*(3/4) ħ^2 = 9/4 ħ^2

So, if we can compute <S_total^2>, then we can find the expectation value of H.

So, H = A*( <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> ) = A*( [ <S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ^2 ] / 2 )

So, if we can find <S_total^2>, then we can compute H.

Now, let's compute <S_total^2> for the state psi.

Given that S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, for a given state, it has a definite eigenvalue. So, the state psi is either in the S=3/2 multiplet or the S=1/2 multiplet.

But how can we tell? Let's look at the state psi. It is a symmetric state with two up spins and one down spin. Let's compute the total spin z-projection.

The total spin z-projection S_z is the sum of the individual S_z.

Each up spin contributes +1/2 ħ, each down contributes -1/2 ħ.

In each term of psi, two spins are up and one is down, so S_z = 2*(1/2) ħ + (-1/2) ħ = (1) ħ. So the state has S_z = ħ, which is the maximum for three spin-1/2 particles.

But wait, S=3/2 particles have maximum S_z=3/2 ħ, which is higher than what we have here, which is 1 ħ. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, if each spin is 1/2, then S_z can be -3/2 ħ for all down, up to +3/2 ħ for all up. But in our case, we have two up and one down, so S_z = 2*(1/2) - 1*(1/2) = (1 - 1/2) ħ = 1/2 ħ? Wait, actually, no.

Wait, each spin has S_z eigenvalues of ± ħ/2. So two up spins contribute +ħ/2 each, and one down spin contributes -ħ/2. So the total S_z is 2*(ħ/2) + (-ħ/2) = (2 - 1)/2 ħ = 1/2 ħ? No, that can't be.

Wait, no. For each spin, if it's up, S_z = +ħ/2; if down, S_z = -ħ/2.

So two up spins: 2*(+ħ/2) = +ħ

One down spin: (-ħ/2)

Total S_z = +ħ - ħ/2 = (1/2) ħ.

Wait, that's only 1/2 ħ. But the maximum possible S_z is 3*(+ħ/2) = 3/2 ħ, which corresponds to all spins up. So, this state has S_z = 1/2 ħ, which is the same as a single spin up and two down spins, but in our case, it's two up and one down.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: in our state psi, we have three terms, each with two up and one down. So when we have two up and one down, the total spin is either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, but how do we know which one it is? Let me think about the possible values.

If I have three spin-1/2 particles, and I have two up and one down, is the total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2?

Well, for two spins up and one spin down, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me consider the possible combinations.

If I have particles 1 and 2 up, and particle 3 down, the total spin can be obtained by combining particles 1 and 2 first. If particles 1 and 2 are in a triplet state (S=1), then combining with particle 3, which is down, gives total spin S=1 + 1/2 = 3/2 or S=1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Alternatively, if particles 1 and 2 are in a singlet state (S=0), then combining with particle 3's down gives S=1/2.

But in our state psi, the state is symmetric, so it must be in the symmetric subspace. So, the symmetric states would include the triplet or singlet combined with the third spin.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to construct the state. Let me think about how the two up and one down states can combine.

Suppose we have three particles, and we want to create a symmetric state with two up and one down. Let's see.

The state |up1 up2 down3> can be written as |up> ⊗ |up> ⊗ |down>

Similarly for the other terms.

But the symmetric state should be invariant under permutation of the spins. So, perhaps the symmetric combination is the sum over all permutations.

Wait, the state given is exactly that: 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). So that is the fully symmetric combination.

Now, to find the total spin S of this state, we can think about the possible ways to combine the three spins.

Wait, if we have two spins up and one down, and arrange them symmetrically, does this correspond to the S=3/2 or S=1/2?

Wait, let's consider the action of S_total^2 on this state. If the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then we can find the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> by considering the action on the state.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, since the state is symmetric, it must belong to the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplet. But which one?

Wait, the S=3/2 multiplet has all symmetric states with two spins up and one spin down? No, actually, the S=3/2 state has all four states with different spin configurations, but when you have two up and one down, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, maybe I can find the expectation value of S_total^2.

Let me note that for a state with two up and one down, the total spin squared is:

< S_total^2 > = (1/2) [ (S_i + S_j)^2 + (S_i + S_k)^2 + (S_j + S_k)^2 ] - (3/4) ħ^2

Wait, I think that's another approach.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the expectation value in terms of the sum of squares of individual spins and pairwise products.

Wait, in any case, perhaps another strategy is to use the fact that the given state is an eigenstate of H. According to the hint, the correct answer is that it is an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue 2/3 A ħ^2. So perhaps I can check if that makes sense.

If psi is an eigenstate of H, then H psi = E psi. So, let me compute H psi.

Given that H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H psi = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi.

But computing this directly might be complicated, but perhaps we can use the fact that S_total^2 is a Casimir operator and express H in terms of S_total^2.

From earlier, H = (A/2)(3 S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)).

Given that each S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ^2, we have S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

Thus, H = (A/2)(3 S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)

So, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H psi is proportional to psi.

Thus, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it is an eigenstate of H.

So, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

If S_total^2 |psi> = s(s+1) ħ^2 |psi>, then the expectation value <S_total^2> is s(s+1) ħ^2.

So, for our state, what is the eigenvalue of S_total^2?

We have to figure out whether the state psi is part of the triplet (S=3/2) or the doublet (S=1/2).

Wait, in the S=3/2 multiplet, the total spin is 3/2, so S_total^2 would act as (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (15/4) ħ^2.

In the S=1/2 multiplet, it would be (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

But in our case, the state psi has two up spins and one down spin. Let me consider the possible configurations.

Wait, if I have two up spins and one down spin, what is the total spin?

I think that when you have two up and one down, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, to figure this out, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the state is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the state is in the symmetric part of the S=1/2 multiplet. Because for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace includes the S=3/2 and the symmetric part of S=1/2. The symmetric part of S=1/2 is a doublet.

But wait, the S=3/2 multiplet is four-dimensional, and the symmetric subspace is four-dimensional, so the S=3/2 must be entirely within the symmetric subspace, and the symmetric part of S=1/2 is two-dimensional. Wait, no, maybe S=3/2 is entirely symmetric, and S=1/2 is split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.

Wait, I think for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is four-dimensional: it includes the S=3/2 quartet and the symmetric S=1/2 doublet.

So, the state psi is in the S=3/2 or in the symmetric S=1/2.

But how can we tell?

Another approach: Let me compute the action of S_total^2 on the state psi.

But computing that would involve a lot of terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the norm of psi under the action of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Wait, let me think of the spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the state with all spins up is |up1 up2 up3>. Its S_total^2 eigenvalue is (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ^2 = 15/4 ħ^2.

If we flip one spin from up to down, say, |up1 up2 down3>, the S_total^2 eigenvalue would change.

But wait, in our state psi, each term is two up and one down. So, it's like we've flipped one spin from up to down in the all-up state.

But perhaps the S_total^2 eigenvalue can be found by considering the effect of the lowering operator.

Wait, more precisely, for the all-up state, S_total^2 |all up> = (15/4 ħ^2) |all up>

If I flip one spin from up to down, this is equivalent to applying a lowering operator, say S3↓, to the all-up state.

So, S3↓ |all up> = |up1 up2 down3>

Then, S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |up1 up2 down3> = (S1 + S2)^2 |up1 up2 down3> + S3^2 |up1 up2 down3> + 2(S1·S3 + S2·S3) |up1 up2 down3>

But wait, perhaps it's better to use the relation S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = (3/4 ħ^2)|up1 up2 down3> + (3/4 ħ^2)|up1 up2 down3> + (3/4 ħ^2)|up1 up2 down3> + 2*(S1·S3 + S2·S3)|up1 up2 down3>

Wait, but that seems incorrect because S1, S2, S3 are operators, not scalars.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi> directly.

Given that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >

But we already know that each <S_i^2> = (3
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian, and I need to figure out if a given spin state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of the energy. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and the Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). 

First, I should recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S_i is (1/2) times the Pauli matrix vector. But maybe I don't need the explicit form of the Pauli matrices right now. Instead, I remember that the dot product of two spin operators can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{ij}^2), where S_{ij} is the total spin of particles i and j. 

So, if I apply this to each term in H, I can rewrite each S_i·S_j term. Let's consider each term:

1. S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1² + S2² - S_{12}²)
2. S1·S3 = (1/4)(S1² + S3² - S_{13}²)
3. S2·S3 = (1/4)(S2² + S3² - S_{23}²)

Adding these up, H becomes:

H = A*( [S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3] ) 
= A*(1/4)(3S1² + 3S2² + 3S3² - (S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²))
= (3A/4)(S1² + S2² + S3² - (S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²))

But I also remember that for the total spin, S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, so S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That means S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. Hmm, that might be useful.

Wait, so the expression in H has S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is equal to (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. Let me substitute that into H:

H = A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 )
= (A/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)

But since each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ²? Wait, no, hold on. S_i² is the square of the spin operator for each particle, which for spin-1/2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So each S_i² is (3/4)ħ².

Thus, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

But what about S_total²? That depends on the total spin. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. So S_total² can be either (3/2)(3/2 +1)ħ² = (15/4)ħ² or (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Now, looking at the state psi given. Let's analyze its structure. It's a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin, and all permutations. So, the state is symmetric under exchange of particles.

Wait, but the individual spin states: each term is like up up down, up down up, down up up. So each term is a permutation of one up and two ups, but with one down. So, actually, it's symmetric under permutation. So perhaps the total spin is higher.

Wait, when you have two up spins and one down, the total spin can be either S=1/2 or 3/2? Hmm, let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet). But here we have three particles, so the total spin can be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is in a particular multiplet. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total spin squared acting on the state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of H directly on the state psi. Since the problem is to find whether psi is an eigenstate, maybe computing H acting on psi is easier.

But H involves terms like S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. So perhaps I can compute the expectation value of each of these terms on psi, sum them, multiply by A, and that's the expectation value of E. If the expectation values of each S_i·S_j are constants, then the sum might be a constant, meaning that psi is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps H can be rewritten in terms of other operators.

Wait, so H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Each S_i·S_j can be written as (1/4)(S_i² + S_j² - S_{ij}²). So H becomes:

H = A*(1/4)[ (S1² + S2² - S_{12}²) + (S1² + S3² - S_{13}²) + (S2² + S3² - S_{23}²) ]

= A*(1/4)[ 3(S1² + S2² + S3²) - (S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²) ]

So H = (3A/4)(S1² + S2² + S3²) - (A/4)(S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²)

Now, each S1², S2², S3² is (3/4)ħ² each, as mentioned before. So S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². So the first term is (3A/4)*(9/4 ħ²) = (27A/16)ħ².

Now, the second term is -(A/4)(S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²). So if I can find the expectation value of each S_{ij}² for the state psi, I can compute the expectation value of H.

But what is S_{ij}²? It's the total spin squared of particles i and j. For two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S_{ij} can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S_{ij}² is either 0*(0+1)ħ² = 0 or 1*(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ².

Wait, so S_{ij}² can be either 0 or 2ħ². So, for each pair (i,j), their total spin squared is either 0 or 2ħ². Therefore, (S_{ij})² is 0 if the pair is in a singlet state, and 2ħ² if it's in a triplet state.

So, for the state psi, which is a combination of states with two spins up and one spin down, I need to figure out for each pair (i,j), whether they form a singlet or triplet.

Let me write down the state psi:

psi = (1/sqrt{3}) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term has two up spins and one down spin. Now, for each pair (i,j):

1. Consider pair (1,2): In each term, particles 1 and 2 are either both up, or one up and one down, or both down?

Wait, in the first term, |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are up. So for pair (1,2), in this term, they are both up, so S_{12}^2 is 2ħ².

Similarly, in the second term, |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 and 2 are up and down. Wait, no. Wait, particles 1 and 2 are in the first and second positions. In |↑↓↑⟩, particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down, particle 3 is up. So S_{12}^2 here is particle 1 and particle 2. So particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down. Their combined spin is a singlet or triplet?

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt{2}, and the triplet states are symmetric: (|↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt{2}, |↓↓⟩).

So in |↑↓↑⟩, the state of particles 1 and 2 is |↑↓⟩, which is part of the triplet, so S_{12}^2 is 2ħ².

Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, the state of particles 1 and 2 is |↓↑⟩, which is also part of the triplet, so S_{12}^2 is 2ħ².

Similarly, for the other pairs:

2. Pair (1,3): In the first term |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 3 are |↑↓⟩. So again, similar to above, |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet, so S_{13}^2 is 2ħ².

In the second term |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 3 are up and up, so |↑↑⟩, which is also part of the triplet, so S_{13}^2 is 2ħ².

In the third term |↓↑↑⟩, particles 1 and 3 are |↓↑⟩, again part of the triplet, so S_{13}^2 is 2ħ².

3. Pair (2,3): Similarly, in the first term |↑↑↓⟩, particles 2 and 3 are |↑↓⟩, which is triplet, so S_{23}^2 is 2ħ².

In the second term |↑↓↑⟩, particles 2 and 3 are |↓↑⟩, triplet, so S_{23}^2 is 2ħ².

In the third term |↓↑↑⟩, particles 2 and 3 are |↑↑⟩, triplet, so S_{23}^2 is 2ħ².

Wait, hold on, this would mean that for all three pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), in each term of psi, the pair is in a triplet state. Therefore, S_{ij}^2 is 2ħ² for each pair. Therefore, S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 = 3*(2ħ²) = 6ħ².

But wait, let me think again. In each term of psi, each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) is in a state |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩, which are all part of the triplet states, so yes, S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ² for each. So their sum is 6ħ².

Therefore, going back to H, which is:

H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6 ħ²)

Compute each term:

(3A/4)*(9/4 ħ²) = (27A/16) ħ²

(A/4)*(6 ħ²) = (6A/4) ħ² = (3A/2) ħ²

Wait, but it's subtracted, so:

H = (27A/16) ħ² - (3A/2) ħ²

Convert (3A/2) to sixteenths: (3A/2) = (24A/16)

So, H = (27A/16 - 24A/16) ħ² = (3A/16) ħ²

Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me step back.

We have H expressed as:

H = (3A/4)(S1² + S2² + S3²) - (A/4)(S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}²)

We have S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ²

Thus, first term: (3A/4)*(9/4 ħ²) = 27A/16 ħ²

Second term: -(A/4)*(6 ħ²) = -6A/4 ħ² = -3A/2 ħ²

So H is 27A/16 ħ² - 3A/2 ħ²

Convert 3A/2 to 24A/16, so 27A/16 - 24A/16 = 3A/16 ħ²

But this contradicts the correct answer given, which is 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the decomposition of S_i·S_j. Let me verify.

I said that S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i² + S_j² - S_{ij}^2). Is that correct?

Yes, because S_i·S_j = (1/2)[ (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ] = (1/4)(S_i² + S_j² - S_{ij}^2 )

So that seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expectation value of S_{ij}².

Wait, let me think again. For each pair in the state psi, their combined spin is either |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩. Each of these is part of the triplet, so S_{ij}² is 2ħ² for each. Thus, in each term of psi, each pair is in a triplet, so S_{ij}² = 2ħ². Therefore, when calculating the expectation value of H, I should have:

H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6ħ²)

But wait, is that correct? Let me compute each term:

First term: (3A/4)*(9/4 ħ²) = (27A/16) ħ²

Second term: -(A/4)*(6 ħ²) = -(6A/4) ħ² = -(3A/2) ħ²

Total H = (27A/16 - 24A/16) ħ² = (3A/16) ħ²

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ², which is approximately 0.666A ħ².

Hmm, that doesn't match. So I must have an error here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that in each term of psi, all the pairs are triplet is wrong.

Wait, let me think about each term.

Take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩. So for pair (1,2): |↑↑⟩, which is triplet, so S_{12}² = 2ħ².

For pair (1,3): |↑↓⟩, which is triplet, so S_{13}² = 2ħ².

For pair (2,3): |↑↓⟩, triplet, so S_{23}² = 2ħ².

So all three pairs have S_{ij}² = 2ħ².

Similarly, for the second term: |↑↓↑⟩. 

Pair (1,2): |↑↓⟩, triplet, S_{12}²=2ħ².

Pair (1,3): |↑↑⟩, triplet, S_{13}²=2ħ².

Pair (2,3): |↓↑⟩, triplet, S_{23}²=2ħ².

Same for the third term.

Thus, in each term of psi, all three pairs have S_{ij}²=2ħ².

Therefore, for each of the three pairs, S_{ij}²=2ħ².

Therefore, S_{12}² + S_{13}² + S_{23}² = 6ħ².

Hence, substituting back into H:

H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6ħ²)

Compute 3A/4 * 9/4 = 27A/16

A/4 *6 = 6A/4 = 3A/2

So H = 27A/16 ħ² - 3A/2 ħ²

Convert 3A/2 to 24A/16:

27A/16 - 24A/16 = 3A/16

Hmm, so according to this, the expectation value is (3A/16) ħ², but the correct answer is supposed to be (2/3) A ħ².

So, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step where I wrote S_i·S_j in terms of S_total² is incorrect.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe instead of expressing H in terms of S1², S2², S3², and S_{ij}², which introduces terms that I have to compute, maybe I can write H in terms of the total spin S_total.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2

Which is (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

So, H = A*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

But then, in my earlier approach, I had H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6ħ²). But that resulted in 3A/16 ħ², which is not the expected 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, maybe I need to compute S_total² for the state psi.

Is that the key?

Yes, because if I can compute S_total² acting on psi, then I can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps H can be written as H = (A/2)(2 S1·S2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3) = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Wait, but that just restates what we have.

Alternatively, maybe think of H in terms of the total spin.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

If the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then H can be expressed as a function of S_total².

So, suppose that psi is an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ². Then, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²)

Wait, because S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

So, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)

If psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then H psi = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²) psi

So, if I can compute S_total² acting on psi, then I can find the energy.

So, perhaps I should compute S_total² psi.

To compute S_total², which is (S1 + S2 + S3)², which is S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But that's exactly 2H/(A) + (S1² + S2² + S3²)

Wait, because H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, S_total² = 3*(3/4 ħ²) + 2H/(A) 

Wait, actually, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (9/4 ħ²) + 2*(H/A)

So, rearranged, 2*(H/A) = S_total² - 9/4 ħ²

Therefore, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)

Which matches what I had earlier.

So, if I can compute S_total² for the state psi, then I can find H psi.

So, let's compute S_total² acting on psi.

But to compute S_total², since S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, then S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So S_total² = 9/4 ħ² + 2H/A

But that seems like going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total² on each term in psi and see if the state is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state psi is symmetric under the exchange of particles. So, perhaps it's in a triplet state.

Wait, but the state has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a state with S_z = 1/2 ħ for each term, but wait, no.

Wait, each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin-z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So the state psi has S_z = 1/2 ħ.

But multiplicity-wise, how does it transform under the permutation of spins?

Wait, the state is symmetric under permutation because it's a sum of all permutations of two ups and one down. So, that is, it's symmetric under exchange of particles, which suggests that the spin state is in the symmetric representation.

But for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin states can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

Wait, perhaps it's in the S=3/2 multiplet.

Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The multiplet for S=3/2 has dimension 2, and for S=1/2, it has dimension 2 as well.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be found by considering all possible combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the states for S=3/2 and S=1/2.

For S=3/2, the states are:

|3/2, 3/2⟩, |3/2, 1/2⟩, |3/2, -1/2⟩, |3/2, -3/2⟩

But I might be misremembering.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the state psi transforms under permutation.

Since the state is symmetric, the total spin must be symmetric as well. For three particles, symmetric spin states can be either S= 3/2 or S=1/2, but I think that S=3/2 is symmetric, and S=1/2 is antisymmetric?

Wait, no, the symmetry of the spin state under permutation is related to the permutation of the particles, not the spin operators.

Wait, perhaps the state being symmetric under particle exchange implies that it's in a symmetric spin state.

In three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin states can have total spin S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, actually, for three particles, the symmetric states under permutation would be the states where swapping any two particles leaves the state unchanged.

But in terms of spin states, the symmetry can be related to whether the spin state is symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange of two particles.

Wait, for two particles, symmetric spin states have even exchange symmetry (triplet) and antisymmetric have odd (singlet). For three particles, it's more complicated.

But in our case, the state psi is symmetric under permutation. So, it's symmetric under exchange of any two particles.

Therefore, maybe the state is in the symmetric subspace of the spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, this symmetric subspace can be constructed.

I think the symmetric spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can be found by taking the symmetric combinations of the individual spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that our state psi is a member of a symmetric spin state.

But to determine whether psi is an eigenstate of H, we need to compute its expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to compute H directly, I can compute the expectation value of S_total².

Since H is expressed in terms of S_total², and if I can compute the expectation value of S_total², I can find H.

Given that psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_total²>.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <S_total²> for the state psi.

Let's recall that S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, <S_total²> = <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >

We already know that each <S_i²> = (3/4)ħ², so <S1²> + <S2²> + <S3²> = 9/4 ħ².

Now, what about <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>?

Well, that's exactly (1/2)(<S_total²> - <S1²> - <S2²> - <S3²> )

Wait, no, earlier we had:

< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 > = (1/2)( <S_total²> - <S1²> - <S2²> - <S3²> )

So, let me denote E = <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>

Then, E = (1/2)( <S_total²> - 9/4 ħ² )

So, if I can compute <S_total²>, then I can get E.

But perhaps I can find <S_total²> directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total² on psi.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the state psi has two spins up and one spin down, it's similar to the state |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩, normalized.

This is actually a state that's been considered in the context of three-qubit states. It's a symmetric state and is sometimes used as an example for spin states.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the action of the total spin operators on this state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for each pair, the spin is triplet, so S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ² as we thought earlier.

So, if that is the case, then each S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ², so their sum is 6ħ².

So, H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6 ħ²) = (27A/16 - 6A/4) ħ² = (27A/16 - 24A/16) ħ² = (3A/16) ħ²

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ², so that suggests that I made a mistake in assuming S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ² for each pair.

Alternatively, perhaps in the given state, for each pair, S_{ij}^2 alternates between 0 and 2ħ².

Wait, let me think again.

In each term of psi, we have two spins up and one spin down. So, for each pair, the two spins can be either both up, or one up and one down.

If both are up, that's |↑↑⟩, which is a triplet, so S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ².

If one is up and one is down, that's |↑↓⟩ or |↓↑⟩, which is also a triplet, so S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ².

Therefore, for each pair in each term of psi, S_{ij}^2 = 2ħ².

Therefore, when we compute the expectation value of S_{ij}^2, it's 2ħ² for each pair.

Therefore, S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 = 6ħ².

So, substituting back into H:

H = (3A/4)(9/4 ħ²) - (A/4)(6ħ²) = (27A/16 - 6A/4) ħ² = (27A/16 - 24A/16) ħ² = 3A/16 ħ²

But that's not the given correct answer.

Wait, perhaps this is a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of H, but my calculation of the expectation value is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the state is not just a simple product state, so when I compute the expectation value of S_{ij}^2, I should not assume it's 2ħ² for each pair, but actually compute it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S_{ij}^2 for each pair in the state psi.

So, let's take pair (1,2). Compute <S_{12}^2> for the state psi.

Since S_{12}^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, <S_{12}^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>

But we already know <S1²> = <S2²> = 3/4 ħ².

So, <S_{12}^2> = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> = 3/2 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>

So, to compute <S_{12}^2>, I need to compute <S1·S2>

Similarly, as before, S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1² + S2² - S_{12}^2)

But that's circular.

Alternatively, perhaps compute <S1·S2> directly.

Since S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

So, in the state psi, which is 1/sqrt{3} ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Compute <S1·S2> as the expectation value of S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z

Since the state is symmetric, perhaps we can compute <S1^z S2^z> easily.

Compute <S1^z S2^z>:

Each term in psi is |s1 s2 s3>, where s1, s2, s3 are up or down.

Compute the expectation value of S1^z S2^z for each term:

First term: |↑↑↓⟩. S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2. So their product is +1/4.

Second term: |↑↓↑⟩. S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2. Product: -1/4.

Third term: |↓↑↑⟩. S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2. Product: -1/4.

So, averaged over the state, each term contributes:

First term: +1/4
Second term: -1/4
Third term: -1/4

But since the state is (1/sqrt{3})(term1 + term2 + term3), the expectation value is:

(1/3)[ (+1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12

So, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12 ħ²

Similarly, compute <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>

For spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S^x and S^y in a state with definite z-spin can be computed.

But in each term of the state, the spins are in a definite state, so perhaps we can compute the expectation values directly.

Alternatively, note that S^x and S^y are off-diagonal in the z-basis. So, for a state like |↑↑↓⟩, which is a product state, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x is zero because S1^x acting on |↑⟩ gives something like |→⟩, but then S2^x acting on |↑⟩ as well, and the inner product might average out.

Wait, let me compute <↑↑↓ | S1^x S2^x | ↑↑↓ >

S1^x and S2^x are operators that flip spins.

Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1^x S2^x for each term.

Take |↑↑↓⟩. S1^x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], same for S2^x.

Compute S1^x S2^x acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

First, write |↑⟩ as (1, 0)^T, |↓⟩ as (0,1)^T.

So, S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(0,1)^T

Similarly, S2^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(0,1)^T


--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H and find its energy if it is, or calculate the expectation value if it isn't.

First, I recall that for spin systems, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of spin singlet and triplet states. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2). Since each spin is 1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, H can be rewritten as A*(sum over i<j (S_i·S_j)) = A*(sum over i<j [(1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/4 ħ²]). So each term contributes a part from the squared sum and a constant.

Next, I think about the total spin. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S_total² can be calculated. Remember that S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding this, S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). 

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2. Plugging this into H, we have:

H = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2 )

Since each S_i² = (3/4)ħ², the sum S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². Thus,

H = A*( (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ) = (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)

So H is proportional to S_total², which is the total spin squared operator. The eigenvalues of S_total² depend on the total spin S. For three spin-1/2 particles, S can be either 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, actually, hold on. Three spin-1/2 particles can combine to give total spin states. Let me recall: two spin-1/2 particles can combine to spin 1 (triplet) or spin 0 (singlet). Then combining a spin 1 with another spin 1/2 can give spin 3/2 or spin 1/2.

So the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Therefore, S_total² can have eigenvalues [ (3/2)(3/2 +1) ]ħ² = (15/4)ħ² for spin 3/2, and [ (1/2)(1/2 +1) ]ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2.

So H is given by (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²). Therefore, the eigenvalues of H will be:

If S_total² = (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ² = (15/4) ħ², then H = (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(3/2 ħ²) = (3/4) A ħ².

Similarly, if S_total² = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ², then H = (A/2)(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(-6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(-3/2 ħ²) = (-3/4) A ħ².

So H has eigenvalues (3/4)A ħ² and (-3/4)A ħ² depending on whether the state is in the spin 3/2 or spin 1/2 subspace.

Now, I need to figure out what the state psi is. Let me write it out:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So each term has two spins up and one spin down, and all the up spins are in the first two positions, cycling through the third position.

I need to find the total spin of this state. Let me think about the possible symmetries. This state seems symmetric under permutation of the particles. Because each term is a permutation of the others. So the state is symmetric.

Wait, but each term has two ups and one down. So how does this relate to the total spin? Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the state with two up and one down cannot be a singlet (total spin 0) because the singlet would require all spins to be opposite, which isn't the case here. Similarly, it's not a triplet either, because triplets have total spin 1.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. For two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet has S=1, and the singlet has S=0. But for three spin-1/2 particles, the situation is a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the state as a combination of states with different total spins.

Alternatively, I can try to calculate S_total² acting on psi and see if it gives an eigenvalue.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the value of S_total² for this state. Since the state is symmetric, maybe it's an eigenstate of S_total².

Alternatively, perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total_z. Let me check the total z-component of spin.

In each term, two spins are up (which contribute +1/2 ħ each) and one is down (which contributes -1/2 ħ). So the total S_z is 2*(1/2) - 1*(1/2) = (1 - 1/2)ħ = 1/2 ħ. So S_z is 1/2 ħ, which is the eigenvalue for each term. So the state is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue (1/2)ħ.

But is it an eigenstate of S_total²? Well, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since S1, S2, S3 are each 1/2, so S1² = 3/4 ħ² for each. So S1² + S2² + S3² = 9/4 ħ².

So S_total² = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + ... = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Since H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is A*(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2. So H is proportional to S_total².

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should compute the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the state psi is symmetric under permutation of the spins, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total². Let me try to compute the action of S_total² on psi.

Since S_total² is the sum of the squares plus twice the sum of the dot products, and since S1², S2², S3² all act on each spin component, maybe it's manageable.

Compute S1² |↑↑↓⟩: Each S1² acts on the first spin, so S1² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩. Similarly, S2² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩, and S3² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩. So the sum S1² + S2² + S3² acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives (9/4 ħ²)|↑↑↓⟩.

Now, for the cross terms: 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let's compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - 3/4 ħ². So (S1 + S2)^2 is S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. But wait, maybe it's better to compute S1·S2 in terms of spin matrices.

Each S_i is a Pauli matrix divided by ħ times 1/2. So S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2). So S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2).

So S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2) |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute σ1·σ2: σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

Let me compute each term:

σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩: σ_x is the Pauli matrix, so σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩. Thus, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩?

Wait, let's see: Wait, σ1_x σ2_x acts on each spin. So:

σ1_x acts on the first spin, turning |↑⟩ to |↓⟩, and σ2_x acts on the second spin, turning |↑⟩ to |↓⟩. So the first two spins become |↓↓⟩, and the third spin remains |↓⟩. So indeed, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_y σ2_y |↑↑↓⟩: σ_y is the imaginary unit times Pauli matrices. Specifically, σ_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩.

Thus, σ1_y σ2_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i|↓⟩)(i|↓⟩) = (i^2)|↓↓⟩ = (-1)|↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑↓⟩: σ_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

So putting it all together:

σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓⟩ = σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1_y σ2_y |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑↓⟩
= |↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(|↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩).

Similarly, compute S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩: That would be (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ3) |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute σ1·σ3:

σ1_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩: σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ3_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so σ1_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩? Wait, no. Wait, let's think:

Wait, σ1_x acts on first spin, σ3_x acts on third spin.

So, |↑↑↓⟩: first spin is ↑, third spin is ↓.

σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ3_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So σ1_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩ (from first spin) and |↑⟩ (from third spin). So the state becomes |↓↑↑⟩ (since the second spin remains ↑).

Similarly, σ1_y σ3_y |↑↑↓⟩: σ1_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ3_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩.

So, σ1_y σ3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i|↓⟩)(-i|↑⟩) = ( -i² )|↓↑⟩ = ( -(-1) )|↓↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

σ1_z σ3_z |↑↑↓⟩: σ1_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ3_z |↓⟩ = -|↑⟩, so σ1_z σ3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑⟩ (-|↑⟩) = -|↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ3 |↑↑↓⟩ = σ1_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1_y σ3_y |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1_z σ3_z |↑↑↓⟩
= |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, compute S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩:

That's (ħ²/4)(σ2·σ3) |↑↑↓⟩. Let's compute σ2·σ3.

σ2_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩: σ2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ3_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So this becomes |↑↓↑⟩.

σ2_y σ3_y |↑↑↓⟩: σ2_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ3_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩, so this becomes (i|↓⟩)(-i|↑⟩) = |↓↑⟩.

σ2_z σ3_z |↑↑↓⟩: σ2_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ3_z |↓⟩ = -|↑⟩, so this becomes |↑↑↓⟩*(-1) = -|↑↑↓⟩.

So σ2·σ3 |↑↑↓⟩ = σ2_x σ3_x |↑↑↓⟩ + σ2_y σ3_y |↑↑↓⟩ + σ2_z σ3_z |↑↑↓⟩
= |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(|↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩)

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(|↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩)

S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/4)(|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩)

So, 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|↑↑↓⟩.

Let me compute each cross term:

First term: 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(ħ²/4)(|↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩) = (ħ²/2)(|↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩)

Second term: 2 S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/2)(|↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩)

Third term: 2 S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ²/2)(|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩)

Now, adding all these together:

(ħ²/2)( |↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩ )

Let me combine the terms:

Looking at each basis state:

1. |↓↓↓⟩: coefficient (ħ²/2)

2. |↑↑↓⟩: appears in first and third terms: (1 - 1 - 1)(ħ²/2) = (-1)(ħ²/2)

3. |↓↑↑⟩: appears in the second term: coefficient (1)(ħ²/2)

4. |↑↓↑⟩: appears in the third term: coefficient (1)(ħ²/2)

5. |↓↓⟩: coefficient (-1)(ħ²/2)

6. |↓↑⟩: appears in second and third terms: (1 +1)(ħ²/2) = (2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²

So putting it all together:

(ħ²/2)|↓↓↓⟩ - (ħ²/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ²/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (ħ²/2)|↓↓⟩ + ħ²|↓↑⟩.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can see how this acts on psi.

Wait, note that psi is a symmetric combination of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩. So when I apply 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) to |↑↑↓⟩, I get a combination of these states and |↓↓↓⟩ and |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, applying it to |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩ will give similar terms.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the state psi is symmetric, maybe all the cross terms in the action of S_total² will leave it in the same subspace.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the expectation value of S_total² in this state, which would give me <psi|S_total²|psi> and then find the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps noting that the state is an eigenstate of S_total_z with eigenvalue 1/2 ħ, and since H is proportional to S_total², we can find the expectation value.

But let me see. Another approach is to note that the state is symmetric under permutation of spins, so it must belong to the symmetric subspace of the total spin states.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is 6-dimensional, and the antisymmetric subspace is also 6-dimensional. But our state is in the symmetric subspace.

Wait, let's think about the total spin. The state has two spins up and one spin down. How does that affect the total spin?

Alternatively, suppose I define the state as having m_s = 1/2 (since two spins up and one spin down gives a total z-component of spin 1/2). So this state is in the m_s = 1/2 subspace.

In that case, the possible total spins are only those that can have m_s = 1/2. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. So m_s = 1/2 is possible for both spin 3/2 and spin 1/2.

But wait, for spin 3/2, the m_s can be 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. For spin 1/2, m_s can be 1/2 or -1/2.

So our state has m_s = 1/2, so it can belong to either the spin 3/2 subspace or the spin 1/2 subspace.

If the state is an eigenstate of S_total², then we can find its eigenvalue and hence the expectation value of H.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the action of S_total² on psi.

Let me write psi as:

psi = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Compute S_total² acting on psi:

S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

But S1, S2, S3 are spin-1/2 operators. So S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already calculated S1·S2, etc., earlier, but perhaps instead of computing each term, maybe a smarter way is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that for a state with two spins up and one spin down, the action of S_total² can be found by considering the possible spin couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that this state is related to the symmetric state in the spin 1/2 subspace.

Wait, but if I think about the possible total spins, the state with two spins up and one spin down... Hmm.

Wait, let's consider the singlet and triplet states for two spins, then combine the third spin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total² on psi.

Let me denote |↑↑↓⟩ as |a⟩, |↑↓↑⟩ as |b⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ as |c⟩.

So psi = (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3).

Compute S_total² |a⟩ = ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 ) |a⟩.

But S1 and S2 are acting on the first two spins. So S1 + S2 is acting on |↑↑⟩, and S3 is acting on |↓⟩.

Wait, so (S1 + S2) |↑↑⟩ = (S1 + S2) |↑↑⟩ = 2|↑↑⟩ + 0, since S1|↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩, wait, no.

Wait, S_i |↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩, S_i |↓⟩ = -(1/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, maybe better to write S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

So S_total |a⟩ = (S1 + S2 + S3) |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute each component:

S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ (on first spin) + 0 + 0.

Wait, no. S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = S1 acting on the first spin. So S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ on the first spin, keeping the others same.

Similarly, S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ on the second spin.

S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)|↓⟩ on the third spin.

Therefore, S_total |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ on spin 1, rest same: (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ with spin 2 flipped? Wait, no, S2 is the operator on spin 2, so S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↓⟩ (spin 2 flipped), but the first spin remains ↑, third spin remains ↓.

Wait, no, if S2 acts on spin 2, it flips spin 2, so S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩, since spin 3 is flipped from ↓ to ↑, with a factor of -1/2.

Wait, no, S3 acting on |↓⟩ gives (-1/2)|↑⟩, so S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S_total |↑↑↓⟩ = S1|↑↑↓⟩ + S2|↑↑↓⟩ + S3|↑↑↓⟩
= (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

So S_total |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

Similarly, S_total |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

S_total |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = (S_total)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S_total (S_total |↑↑↓⟩ ).

We have S_total |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

So S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = S_total [ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: S_total [ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ ] = (1/2) S_total |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)[ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ ]

Second term: S_total [ (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ ] = (1/2) S_total |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)[ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ]

Third term: S_total [ (-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ ] = (-1/2) S_total |↑↑↑⟩.

Compute S_total |↑↑↑⟩:

S1|↑↑↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩,

S2|↑↑↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩,

S3|↑↑↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

Thus, S_total |↑↑↑⟩ = (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ = (3/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ is:

(1/2)[ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ ] +
(1/2)[ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ] -
(1/2)(3/2)|↑↑↑⟩.

Let me compute each part:

First part: (1/2)(1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩,

(1/2)(1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ = (1/4)|↑↓↑⟩,

(1/2)(-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)|↑↑↑⟩.

Second part: (1/2)(1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↑↑↓⟩,

(1/2)(-1/2)|↑↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)|↑↑↑⟩,

(1/2)(1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ = (1/4)|↓↑↑⟩.

Third part: (-1/2)(3/2)|↑↑↑⟩ = (-3/4)|↑↑↑⟩.

Now, combine all terms:

- |↑↑↓⟩: (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 |↑↑↓⟩

- |↑↓↑⟩: (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 |↑↓↑⟩

- |↓↑↑⟩: (1/4)|↓↑↑⟩

- |↑↑↑⟩: (-1/4 -1/4 -3/4) = (-5/4)|↑↑↑⟩

So S_total² |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/4)|↓↑↑⟩ - (5/4)|↑↑↑⟩.

Similarly, compute S_total² |↑↓↑⟩.

Following similar steps, but it's going to be very time-consuming. Perhaps instead of computing each term, which is error-prone, I can think about the state's symmetry.

Given that psi is symmetric under permutation of spins, it's likely an eigenstate of S_total². Thus, S_total² |psi⟩ = E |psi⟩, where E is the eigenvalue.

Given that, perhaps we can compute <psi| S_total² |psi⟩.

Since S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3),

So <psi| S_total² |psi⟩ = <psi| (S1² + S2² + S3²) |psi⟩ + 2 <psi| (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi⟩.

First, compute <S1² + S2² + S3²> = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

Second, compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>. Each term is the same due to symmetry, so compute <S1·S2> and multiply by 3.

Compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Since S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - 3/4 ħ², so

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/2) <psi| (S1 + S2)^2 |psi> - (3/4) ħ² <psi| psi>.

We know that <psi| psi> = 1, so the second term is - (3/4) ħ².

Now, compute (S1 + S2)^2 |psi>.

Since S1 and S2 are spin operators, and psi is a symmetric combination, let's see:

(S1 + S2) |a⟩ = S1 |a⟩ + S2 |a⟩,

Similarly for |b⟩ and |c⟩.

But since the state is symmetric, perhaps (S1 + S2) |psi⟩ is proportional to |psi⟩.

Wait, let me see:

(S1 + S2) |a⟩ = S1 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, (S1 + S2) |b⟩ = S1 |↑↓↑⟩ + S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

(S1 + S2) |c⟩ = S1 |↓↑↑⟩ + S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2) |psi⟩ = (S1 + S2)(|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3) = [ (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ] / sqrt(3).

Wait, let me compute each term:

(S1 + S2)|a⟩ = (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩,

(S1 + S2)|b⟩ = (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩,

(S1 + S2)|c⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, adding them up:

(1/2|↑↑↓⟩ + 1/2|↑↓↑⟩) + (1/2|↑↓↑⟩ + 1/2|↓↑↑⟩) + (-1/2|↑↑↓⟩ + 1/2|↓↑↑⟩) all over sqrt(3).

Combine like terms:

|↑↑↓⟩: (1/2 - 1/2) = 0,

|↑↓↑⟩: (1/2 + 1/2) = 1,

|↓↑↑⟩: (1/2 + 1/2) = 1.

So (S1 + S2)|psi⟩ = (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Thus, (S1 + S2)^2 |psi⟩ = (S1 + S2)( (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3) ).

Compute (S1 + S2)(|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩).

First, (S1 + S2)|↑↓↑⟩ = S1 |↑↓↑⟩ + S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, (S1 + S2)|↓↑↑⟩ = S1 |↓↑↑⟩ + S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)(|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩) = [ (1/2)|↑↓↑⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ] + [ (-1/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (1/2)|↓↑↑⟩ ].

Combine terms:

|↑↓↑⟩: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1,

|↓↑↑⟩: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1,

|↑↑↓⟩: -1/2.

Thus, (S1 + S2)^2 |psi⟩ = (1|↑↓↑⟩ + 1|↓↑↑⟩ - 1/2 |↑↑↓⟩)/sqrt(3).

Therefore, <psi| (S1 + S2)^2 |psi⟩ = <psi| (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩)/sqrt(3).

Since psi is (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3), the inner product is:

( <a| + <b| + <c| ) (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ - (1/2)|↑↑↓⟩)/sqrt(3).

Compute each term:

< a | ↑↓↑ ⟩ = <↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3 times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find its energy. If not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall that spin operators for each particle, S_i, are vectors. The dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2). Maybe that could help simplify the Hamiltonian.

But wait, H is a sum of three such dot products: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, if I can write each term in terms of total spin squared, perhaps I can combine them.

Let me denote the total spin of the three particles as S. Then S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, rearranging this, we have:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So, H can be rewritten as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 )

Since each S_i^2 is (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², right? Because for spin 1/2, S^2 has eigenvalues (s(s+1))ħ², so s=1/2.

So, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, plugging that in:

H = A*( (S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 )

Simplify that:

H = A*( (S^2/(2ħ²)) - (9/8) )

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. S^2 is measured in units of ħ², so when I write S^2, it's s(s+1)ħ². Therefore, S^2 = s(s+1)ħ², so s=1/2, so S^2 = (3/4)ħ². But in the expression for H, we have S^2, which is a scalar operator. Therefore, when I write S^2, it's a number.

Wait, perhaps I should handle the units properly. Let me consider that S1·S2 is in units of ħ². So when we write H, it's just an operator with the same units.

So, let me define S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, rearranged:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Thus, H = A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 )

Since S1, S2, S3 are spin 1/2 particles, S1^2 = (3/4)ħ², same for S2 and S3.

So, H = A*( (S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 )

Therefore, H = A*( (S^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 )

So, H = (A/2)S^2 - (9A/8)ħ²

Wait, no. Actually, since S^2 is in units of ħ², I think I need to write it as S^2 = S(S+1)ħ², so S^2 is multiplied by ħ². Therefore, S1·S2 is in terms of ħ².

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of operators. Let me express S1·S2.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{1+2}^2). That formula is correct because (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2S1·S2, so S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. So yes, that's correct.

Thus, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S3^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 )

Wait, no. That seems complicated. Maybe instead, as I did before, note that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Yes, that's the correct identity. So H can be expressed in terms of S^2 and the individual S_i^2.

Therefore, H = A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2 )

Each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ², so plugging that in:

H = A*( (S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( (S^2 - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 )

So H = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

But S^2 is the total spin squared operator, so S^2 |s, m> = s(s+1) ħ² |s, m>.

Therefore, for a given state, H acts on it as (A/2) s(s+1) ħ² - (9A/8) ħ².

Thus, to find the eigenvalue, we need to know the total spin s of the state ψ.

So, let's find the total spin of ψ. The state ψ is given as (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/√3.

Let me write this out:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

I need to determine the total spin s of this state. The total spin s can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet) for three spin 1/2 particles.

But let me compute the total spin squared operator S^2 acting on ψ. Since S^2 commutes with the spin states, we can compute ⟨ψ| S^2 |ψ⟩.

But maybe it's easier to see the possible couplings of the three spins.

Each term in ψ is a state with two up spins and one down spin. So, the state has two up and one down.

Wait, each term has two up spins and one down, but arranged in different positions.

So, the total spin depends on how the spins are combined. Let me think about how these states transform under spin rotations.

Alternatively, since this state is symmetric under permutations of the particles, it might be a symmetric spin state.

Wait, let me check the symmetry. Each term in ψ is a permutation with two up and one down. So, the state ψ is symmetric under swapping particles.

But wait, swapping particles 1 and 2 in |↑↑↓⟩ would give |↑↑↓⟩, which is the same state. Similarly for the others. So, yes, ψ is symmetric under permutations.

Therefore, the state is symmetric, so it can be a triplet state, which is symmetric, or a singlet state, which is antisymmetric.

But since it's symmetric, it can't be a singlet state. So, the total spin s must be 1.

Therefore, the state ψ is a triplet state with s=1.

Therefore, S^2 |ψ⟩ = s(s+1) ħ² |ψ⟩ = 2 ħ² |ψ⟩.

So, the eigenvalue is 2 ħ².

Therefore, plugging back into H:

H = (A/2)(2 ħ²) - (9A/8) ħ² = A ħ² - (9A/8) ħ² = (8A/8 - 9A/8) ħ² = (-A/8) ħ².

Wait, that can't be right because the expected answer is (2/3 A ħ²). So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, let's double-check. If s=1, then S^2 |ψ⟩ = 2 ħ² |ψ⟩, right? Because s(s+1) = 1*2 = 2.

So, H = (A/2)*2 ħ² - (9A/8) ħ².

So, (A/2)*2 ħ² is A ħ².

Then, A ħ² - (9A/8) ħ² = (8A/8 - 9A/8) ħ² = (-A/8) ħ².

But according to the given answer, it's 2/3 A ħ², which is positive. So, I must have messed up something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let's re-examine the Hamiltonian.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Alternatively, I can also write H = A*( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2

Which is the same as H = (A/2)(S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)

Since S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are all (3/4)ħ², so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, H = (A/2)(S^2 - 9/4 ħ²)

So, H = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ²

Wait, but S^2 is in units of ħ², right? So S^2 is s(s+1) ħ². So, H is (A/2)(s(s+1) ħ²) - (9A/8) ħ².

So, the eigenvalue is (A/2)*s(s+1) - 9A/8

But wait, is that correct? Wait, no, I think the operator S^2 has units of ħ², so when we write S^2, it's multiplied by ħ².

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of operator dimensions. The operator S^2 is in units of ħ², so when acting on a state, S^2 |ψ⟩ gives (s(s+1) ħ²) |ψ⟩.

So, the term (A/2) S^2 is (A/2)(s(s+1) ħ²) operator.

Therefore, when acting on |ψ⟩, it gives (A/2)(2 ħ²) |ψ⟩, since s=1.

Similarly, the second term is (9A/8) ħ², which is a scalar multiple.

Therefore, the total energy is:

E = (A/2)(2 ħ²) - (9A/8) ħ²

Compute that:

(A/2)(2 ħ²) = A ħ²

A ħ² - (9A/8) ħ² = (8A/8 - 9A/8) ħ² = (-A/8) ħ²

Hmm, so negative energy. But the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ².

So, I must have messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see. The identity is S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S^2 - 9/4 ħ² )

Thus, H = (A/2) S^2 - (A/2)(9/4) ħ² = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ²

So, when acting on the eigenstate |s=1>, we have H|ψ> = (A/2)(2 ħ²) |ψ> - (9A/8) ħ² |ψ>

So, (A/2)(2 ħ²) is A ħ², so H|ψ> = (A ħ² - 9A/8 ħ²)|ψ> = (-A/8 ħ²)|ψ>

Which is negative. But the supposed answer is positive 2/3 A ħ².

So, maybe my assumption that s=1 is incorrect? Or perhaps ψ is not a triplet state.

Wait, ψ is symmetric, so it can be a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute the total spin another way. Let's compute S_total^2 for the state ψ.

Compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

S_total = S1 + S2 + S3

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) |ψ⟩

We know S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ²

So, ⟨S1^2⟩ = ⟨S2^2⟩ = ⟨S3^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ²

And then, we have 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so 2(S1·S2 + ...) = 2H/A * something? Wait, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩.

Alternatively, note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2

So, in H, which is A*(sum S_i·S_j), so H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 )

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*( ⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2

So, if I compute ⟨S_total^2⟩ for ψ, I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, let me compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

Since S_total^2 is a scalar operator, I can compute it by considering the action of S_total^2 on |ψ⟩.

But since ψ is symmetric, perhaps it's easier to note that the possible values of S_total^2 are 0 or 2 ħ² for three spin 1/2 particles.

Wait, no. For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1 or 0.

Wait, but if the state is symmetric, it must be in the triplet state with S=1. So, S_total^2 acting on |ψ> would give 2 ħ² |ψ>.

But earlier, when I plug that into H, I get negative energy, which contradicts the given answer.

Wait, maybe my calculation is correct, but the given answer is wrong. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the state is actually a singlet state, which would have S=0, so S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = 0. But wait, ψ is symmetric, so it can't be a singlet.

Wait, the singlet state is antisymmetric, so ψ can't be a singlet since it's symmetric.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the state ψ is a combination of triplet states.

But no, ψ is given as a symmetric state with two up and one down. So, it's a part of the triplet.

Wait, let's compute the total spin more carefully.

Each term in ψ is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Let me compute the total spin for each term.

For each term, the total spin is the combination of two up and one down spins.

Each spin is 1/2. So, when combining two up and one down, the total spin can be 1 or 0.

Wait, for two up and one down, the possible total spin is 1 or 0, but the singlet state would have S=0.

But in this case, since the state is symmetric, it must have S=1.

Wait, let me represent each term as a combination.

Take |↑↑↓⟩. This can be expressed as a combination of the triplet states.

The triplet states are |1,1⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩, |1,0⟩ = (|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√2, |1,-1⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

Wait, but our state ψ is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

Wait, so |↑↑↓⟩ is |1,1⟩? No, because |↑↑↑⟩ is |1,1⟩.

Wait, no, |↑↑↓⟩ can be expressed as a combination of triplet states. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the total spin squared.

Compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

To compute S_total^2, which is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding this, as before, gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Thus, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

We know each ⟨S_i^2⟩ is (3/4) ħ².

So, that's 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩.

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{1+2}^2)

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ - ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩ )

Since S_{1+2} is the total spin of particles 1 and 2, which is S1 + S2.

For two spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin is 1 or 0.

Similarly, for each pair, we need to find ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩.

But wait, the state ψ is symmetric, but not necessarily an eigenstate of S_{1+2}^2.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Wait, another approach: note that the expectation value of S1·S2 is [⟨S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{1+2}^2⟩]/2.

But without knowing ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩, which depends on how the spins are arranged.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Note that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩)

But from the earlier expansion, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2(A' ), where A' = ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But wait, no, because H is proportional to that sum. H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

But S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ² + 2(sum S_i·S_j). Therefore, sum S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

Thus, ⟨sum S_i·S_j⟩ = (⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨sum S_i·S_j⟩ ) = A*( (⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 )

But to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I need to figure out how it acts on ψ.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩ directly.

Let me expand S_total^2 again.

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

So, if I can compute ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩, I can find ⟨S_total^2⟩, and then plug into ⟨H⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩ separately.

Note that each term in ψ is of the form |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Let me compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

But S1·S2 is a spin operator, so it acts on the individual spins.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute this using the expectation value formula.

Each S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2 )

So, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/2)(⟨S_i^2⟩ + ⟨S_j^2⟩ - ⟨S_{i+j}^2⟩ )

Each ⟨S_i^2⟩ is 3/4 ħ².

So, for ⟨S1·S2⟩, it would be (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² - ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩ )

Similarly for ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩.

So, let's compute ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩, which is the expectation value of the total spin squared for particles 1 and 2.

But the state ψ is a symmetric combination of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

So, each term has one down spin and two up spins, but in different positions.

But S_{1+2}^2 acts on particles 1 and 2, treating particle 3 as spectator.

So, if we can express ψ in terms of the states of particles 1 and 2, we can compute ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the down spin in particle 3 can be in any of the three positions, but for S_{1+2}^2, it's only concerned with particles 1 and 2.

But in each term of ψ, particles 1 and 2 are both up in one case, and each is up in one case and down in the other.

Wait, let's take ψ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3

So, for each term, particles 1 and 2 can be |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩.

So, let's compute the average of S_{1+2}^2 over each term.

For |↑↑↓⟩, S_{1+2}^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S_{1+2}^2 |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩.

But (S1 + S2)^2 is a scalar operator on particles 1 and 2.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩.

The eigenvalues for (S1 + S2)^2 are 0 or 2 ħ².

Wait, but for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state (antisymmetric) has S=0, and the triplet states (symmetric) have S=1.

So, |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet state, which has S=1, so (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S_{1+2}^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

The state |↑↓⟩ is part of the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, |↑↓⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 is the triplet state, which has S=1, so (S1 + S2)^2 acting on this gives 2 ħ².

But |↑↓⟩ by itself is not an eigenstate. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, let me compute the expectation value ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩ for each term in ψ.

Each term in ψ is |s⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

For each |s⟩, compute ⟨s| S_{1+2}^2 |s⟩.

So, for |↑↑↓⟩: as above, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑⟩. So, ⟨↑↑↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↑↓⟩ = 2 ħ².

But wait, the state is |↑↑↓⟩, so in the first term, it's |↑↑↓⟩, and (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 2 ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩: (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩.

But |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet and singlet states.

Wait, but to compute ⟨↑↓↑ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ( (S1 + S2)^2 ) |↑↓⟩.

But (S1 + S2) is a vector operator, so (S1 + S2)^2 is scalar.

But |↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate of (S1 + S2)^2. So, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe I can compute it using the states.

Note that:

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2

We know S1^2 = 3/4 ħ², same for S2^2.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 S1·S2 = 3/2 ħ² + 2 S1·S2.

So, ⟨↑↓↑ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = 3/2 ħ² + 2 ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{1+2}^2 )

So, ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² - ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩ )

But we don't know ⟨S_{1+2}^2⟩ for |↑↓↑⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for the state |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are in a state that is part of the triplet.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that |↑↓↑⟩ can be expressed as a combination of the triplet and singlet states.

Wait, for two spins, |↑↓⟩ can be written as ( |1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩ ) / √2, where |1,0⟩ is the triplet state and |0,0⟩ is the singlet.

But in our case, the third spin is up, so it's |↑↓↑⟩ = |↑⟩ |↓⟩ |↑⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value ⟨↑↓↑ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Expressed as:

⟨↑↓↑ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑ | (S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2) |↑↓↑⟩

= ⟨↑↓↑ | S1^2 |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑ | S2^2 |↑↓↑⟩ + 2 ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩

= 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩

Now, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - (S1 + S2)^2 )

So, S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² - (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩ )

Wait, but this seems circular.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of the singlet and triplet states.

For two spin 1/2 particles, the states are:

|1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩

|1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2

|1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩

|0,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2

So, if I express |↑↓↑⟩ as a combination of these.

But |↑↓↑⟩ is a three-spin state, not a two-spin state. So, I can't directly express it in terms of two-spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, maybe we can consider that for the state |↑↓↑⟩, the spins of particles 1 and 2 are in a product state |↑↓⟩.

So, particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↓⟩, which is a combination of triplet and singlet.

But as I said, |↑↓⟩ = (|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩)/√2.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 (|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩)/√2.

We know that (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ = 2 ħ² |1,0⟩, and (S1 + S2)^2 |0,0⟩ = 0.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (2 ħ² |1,0⟩ + 0)/√2 = √2 ħ² |1,0⟩

So, ⟨↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (2 ħ²)/2 = ħ².

Wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, |↑↓⟩ = (|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩)/√2.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 (|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩)/√2

= (2 ħ² |1,0⟩)/√2 + (0 |0,0⟩)/√2

= √2 ħ² |1,0⟩

So, ⟨↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓ | √2 ħ² |1,0⟩

But |1,0⟩ is orthogonal to |↑↓⟩ because |1,0⟩ is symmetric (up down) and |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet.

Wait, no, actually, |1,0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

So, the inner product ⟨↑↓ |1,0⟩ is ⟨↑↓ | (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 = (1 + 0)/√2 = 1/√2.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = √2 ħ² * (1/√2) ) = ħ².

So, yes, ⟨↑↓ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = ħ².

Therefore, going back, for the state |↑↓↑⟩, which is |↑⟩ |↓⟩ |↑⟩, the expectation value ⟨↑↓↑ | (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩ is:

(S1 + S2)^2 acting on |↑↓↑⟩ gives:

(S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ = (2 ħ² |1,0⟩) |↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑⟩ |1,0⟩ |↑⟩.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓⟩ = 2 ħ² |1,0⟩, as before.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I need to figure out if the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H, and if so, find its energy. If not, I have to calculate the expectation value of H. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S1, S2, S3 are the spin operators for each particle.

First, let me recall that each spin operator S_i is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices for each particle. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, each spin operator has eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

The state ψ is given as:

ψ = (1/√3)*( |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ )

So, ψ is a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up, and one is down. Let me count the number of each term: there are three terms, each with a different particle in the down position. So, this is a symmetric state with respect to exchange of any two particles.

Now, since the Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of spin operators, I can write H as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

I know that the dot product of two spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2)

Where S_{i+j}^2 is the square of the total spin for particles i and j.

So, applying this to each term in H:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²)
Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, H becomes:

H = A*( (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²) + (1/2)(S1² + S3² - S13²) + (1/2)(S2² + S3² - S23²) )

Let me simplify this:

H = (A/2) [ (S1² + S2² - S12²) + (S1² + S3² - S13²) + (S2² + S3² - S23²) ]

Combine like terms:

= (A/2) [ 2S1² + 2S2² + 2S3² - (S12² + S13² + S23²) ]

Since each S_i² is for a single spin-1/2 particle, S_i² = (ħ²)( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) = (ħ²)(3/4) = (3ħ²)/4.

Therefore, 2S1² + 2S2² + 2S3² = 2*(3ħ²/4)*3 = (3ħ²/2)*3 = (9ħ²)/2.

Now, the other term is -(S12² + S13² + S23²). Each S12² is the square of the total spin for particles 1 and 2. Similarly for S13² and S23².

The possible total spin states for two spin-1/2 particles can be either spin 0 (singlet) or spin 1 (triplet). The eigenvalues of S12² are s(s+1)ħ², where s is 0 or 1.

So, for each pair, S12² = 0 or (2ħ²), because for s=0: 0(0+1)=0, and for s=1: 1(1+1)=2.

Looking at the state ψ, how does it behave under exchange? Since ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, this suggests that ψ is symmetric with respect to swapping particles.

Let me think: each term in ψ is a permutation of two ups and one down. So, the overall state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. Therefore, when considering pairs, like 1 and 2, are they in a symmetric or antisymmetric state?

Wait, perhaps I should consider what the total spin S12² would be for each pair in the state ψ.

But maybe another approach is better. Since the Hamiltonian H is in terms of spin-spin interactions, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H in the state ψ, rather than trying to diagonalize H directly.

But to compute expectation value, I can use the fact that for each pair, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be computed.

Alternatively, note that the state ψ is symmetric, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator.

Wait, the state ψ is a symmetric combination of two up and one down. Let's think about the total spin. The total spin S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

But in the given state ψ, each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin can vary depending on which spin is down.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the state in terms of the total spin eigenstates.

Alternatively, note that the singlet state for three spins is antisymmetric, but ψ is symmetric, so it can't be a singlet or a triplet?

Wait, no, the triplet is symmetric, but for three spins, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are S = 3/2 (which is symmetric) and S = 1/2 (which is antisymmetric). So, ψ is symmetric, so it must be part of the triplet S=3/2 subspace.

So, perhaps ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = (15/4)ħ².

If that's the case, then we can write the Hamiltonian H in terms of S_total^2.

Wait, let me think. Since H is a sum of pairwise interactions, perhaps we can express H in terms of S_total^2.

Let me recall that:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Thus, from this, we can express the sum of the pairwise dot products as:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²)) / 2

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be written as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²))

We already computed S1² + S2² + S3², which is 3*(3ħ²/4) = 9ħ²/4.

So, if the state ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H is proportional to S_total^2.

Given that ψ is symmetric, and for three spins, the symmetric states have total spin S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 (which is symmetric) and 1/2 (which is antisymmetric). Therefore, ψ is a symmetric state, so it must lie in the S=3/2 subspace.

Thus, ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

Therefore, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = (15/4 ħ²) |ψ⟩.

Plugging this back into H:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9ħ²/4)).

So, the expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| (9ħ²/4) |ψ⟩ )

But since ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, the first term is (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9ħ²/4) = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(3/2 ħ²) = (3A/4) ħ².

Wait, but according to the given correct answer, it's 2/3 A ħ². So, that suggests either my calculation is wrong, or perhaps ψ is not in the S=3/2 subspace.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, let's re-examine the state ψ.

ψ = (1/√3)(|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ )

Is this state an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Well, S_total^2 is the sum of squares of each spin plus twice the sum of each pairwise dot product.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for this state.

Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, let's compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

First, compute S1², S2², S3² on |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩:

S1² |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ = (3ħ²/4) |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩
Similarly for S2² and S3².

Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² acting on ψ gives (9ħ²/4) ψ.

Now, compute 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²)

Similarly for others.

So, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (S1² + S2² + S1² + S3² + S2² + S3²) - (S12² + S13² + S23²)

Wait, that's not exactly right. Let me correct.

From S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i² + S_j² - S_{i+j}²), so 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (S1² + S2² + S1² + S3² + S2² + S3²) - (S12² + S13² + S23²)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3):

= 2*( (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²) + (1/2)(S1² + S3² - S13²) + (1/2)(S2² + S3² - S23²) )

= (S1² + S2² - S12² + S1² + S3² - S13² + S2² + S3² - S23² )

= (2S1² + 2S2² + 2S3² - S12² - S13² - S23² )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, S_total^2 = 2S1² + 2S2² + 2S3² - (S12² + S13² + S23² )

So, when acting on ψ, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = [2*(3ħ²/4) *3 - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

Wait, that is:

= [ (9ħ²/4)*3 - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = [2*(S1² + S2² + S3²) - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

= [2*(3ħ²/4)*3 - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

Wait, actually, S1² + S2² + S3² is 3*(3ħ²/4) = 9ħ²/4.

Thus, 2*(9ħ²/4) = 9ħ²/2.

So, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = [9ħ²/2 - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

Therefore, to find the eigenvalue, I need to compute the expectation of S12², S13², S23² in the state ψ.

But what is the value of S12², S13², S23² when acting on ψ?

Alternatively, since ψ is symmetric, perhaps we can find the expectation value ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩.

But let me think about the possible values of S12².

The state ψ is a symmetric combination. So, when considering S12², which acts on particles 1 and 2, it will mix the state with other states.

But wait, since ψ is symmetric under exchange of 1 and 2, perhaps S12² preserves the symmetry. Therefore, S12² |ψ⟩ is proportional to |ψ⟩?

Wait, let me compute S12² |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩.

First, S12² = (S1 + S2)² = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Applying S12² to |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩:

= S1² |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + S2² |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩

Each S1² and S2² gives (3ħ²/4) |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩.

Now, what is S1·S2 |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩?

= (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²) |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩

But wait, this is getting a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that when S12² acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it gives a combination of states from the triplet and singlet states.

Wait, the state |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric states.

But ψ is symmetric, so perhaps the action of S12² on ψ is proportional to ψ.

Alternatively, maybe try to compute the expectation value directly.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩.

First, S12² is (S1 + S2)² = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

We can write:

⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ + 2 ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩

Since S1² and S2² are diagonal in the computational basis, we can compute each term.

First, S1² |ψ⟩ = (3ħ²/4) |ψ⟩, same for S2². So:

⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ = (3ħ²/4) ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (3ħ²/4)*1 = 3ħ²/4

Similarly, ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ = 3ħ²/4

Now, the third term is 2⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |ψ⟩:

= (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²) |ψ⟩

Wait, that's the reverse of the earlier expression. Hmm, perhaps I need to express S1·S2 in terms of S12².

But perhaps instead, let me compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

We know that S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = (1/2)(S1² |ψ⟩ + S2² |ψ⟩ - S12² |ψ⟩ )

Therefore,

⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = (1/2)(⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

So, substituting the known values:

= (1/2)(3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4 - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

= (1/2)( (6ħ²/4) - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

So, putting it all together:

⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = (1/2)(6ħ²/4 - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

But we also have:

⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ = 3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4 + 2⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩

Substituting the expression above into this equation.

So,

⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ = (3ħ²/4 + 3ħ²/4) + 2*(1/2)(6ħ²/4 - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

Simplify:

⟨S12²⟩ = (6ħ²/4) + (6ħ²/4 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

⟨S12²⟩ = (6ħ²/4) + (6ħ²/4) - ⟨S12²⟩

Bring the ⟨S12²⟩ to the left:

⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S12²⟩ = (12ħ²/4)

2⟨S12²⟩ = 3ħ²

⟨S12²⟩ = (3/2) ħ²

Similarly, due to the symmetry, ⟨S13²⟩ = ⟨S23²⟩ = (3/2) ħ²

Therefore, going back to S_total^2:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = [9ħ²/2 - (3/2 ħ² + 3/2 ħ² + 3/2 ħ²) ]

= [9ħ²/2 - (9/2 ħ²) ] = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, S_total^2 isn't zero.

Wait, no, let me correct:

Wait, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = [9ħ²/2 - (S12² + S13² + S23² ) ] |ψ⟩

Therefore, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9ħ²/2 - (⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S13²⟩ + ⟨S23²⟩ )

We found that ⟨S12²⟩ = ⟨S13²⟩ = ⟨S23²⟩ = 3/2 ħ²

Thus,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9ħ²/2 - (3/2 + 3/2 + 3/2) ħ²

= 9ħ²/2 - (9/2) ħ² = 0

Wait, that gives ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 0? But that can't be, because for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. If it's in a triplet state (S=3/2), then ⟨S_total^2⟩ should be (15/4) ħ². But according to this, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 0, which contradicts.

So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, my earlier approach might be flawed. Let me try a different approach.

Since H can be written as H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Each term S_i·S_j can be written as (1/4)(2S_i · 2S_j) where 2S_i is the Pauli matrices times ħ.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps express H in terms of the total spin.

But another idea: the state ψ has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin can be computed as S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

In each term of ψ, two spins are up and one is down. Let me compute the total spin for each term.

Take |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩: the total spin in this state is S1 + S2 - S3.

But wait, that's not the way. Alternatively, perhaps calculate the expectation value of S_total².

Alternatively, note that the Hamiltonian H is the sum of the pairwise interactions, which can be expressed in terms of the sum of the pairwise spin operators.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value of H directly.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Each S_i·S_j can be written as ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ) / 2

Therefore, H = A*( (S12² - S1² - S2²)/2 + (S13² - S1² - S3²)/2 + (S23² - S2² - S3²)/2 )

= (A/2)( S12² + S13² + S23² - 2S1² - 2S2² - 2S3² )

So, H = (A/2)( S12² + S13² + S23² - 2*(3ħ²/4)*3 )

= (A/2)( S12² + S13² + S23² - (9ħ²/2) )

Thus, to compute ⟨H⟩, we can write:

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)( ⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S13²⟩ + ⟨S23²⟩ - 9ħ²/2 )

We already found that ⟨S12²⟩ = ⟨S13²⟩ = ⟨S23²⟩ = (3/2) ħ².

So,

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)( (3/2 + 3/2 + 3/2) ħ² - (9ħ²/2) )

= (A/2)( (9/2) ħ² - (9/2) ħ² )

= (A/2)(0) = 0

Wait, that can't be right either because the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm. So, something is wrong with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ⟨S12²⟩. Let me recompute it.

Earlier, I found that when I tried to compute ⟨S12²⟩, I ended up with ⟨S12²⟩ = 3/2 ħ², but that led to ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 0, which is impossible.

But when I actually computed the expectation value by expanding the states, I found that ⟨S12²⟩ = 3/2 ħ².

But now, when plugging back into H, it gives zero, which contradicts the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, another method: Consider that the state ψ is a symmetric combination of three states with two spins up and one spin down.

Since it's symmetric, it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator S_total². So, in the subspace of symmetric states for three spins, the possible total spins are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2.

The state ψ is symmetric, so it's in the S=3/2 subspace? Or is it in S=1/2?

Wait, S=3/2 is a symmetric subspace, and S=1/2 is antisymmetric.

Wait, for three spins, the symmetric subspace is 6-dimensional, with S=3/2 (which has 5 states: but wait, no, for three spins, the possible S is 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, no, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 (triplet) and 1/2 (singlet). The triplet is symmetric, the singlet is antisymmetric.

But wait, for three particles, the symmetric subspace has dimension 6, which can be broken into symmetric and antisymmetric parts. The triplet (S=3/2) has 5 states? No, wait, for three particles, the possible total spin S can be 3/2 and 1/2. For S=3/2, the multiplet has dimension 5, and for S=1/2, the multiplet has dimension 1? No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for N particles, the symmetric subspace has dimension (2N choose N). For N=3, that's 6. But the possible total spins can be up to N/2. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. So, the symmetric subspace has dimension 6, but it's a combination of S=3/2 (which has dimension 5) and S=1/2 (which has dimension 1). Wait, that adds to 6. So, the symmetric subspace is 6-dimensional, with 5 states of S=3/2 and 1 state of S=1/2.

Wait, no, that can't be because the dimensions should add up.

Wait, for two particles, spin-1/2, symmetric subspace is 3-dimensional (triplet), with S=1, dimension 3.

For three particles, spin-1/2: the symmetric subspace is 6-dimensional. The decomposition is (antisymmetric part) ⊕ (symmetric part). The antisymmetric part is the singlet, S=0, which is 1-dimensional. So the symmetric part is 5-dimensional.

But the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, no, for three spin-1/2, the possible total spins are S=3/2 (which has dimension 5) and S=1/2 (which has dimension 1). So, symmetric subspace is the 5-dimensional S=3/2 plus the 1-dimensional S=1/2, totaling 6, which matches (2*3 choose 3)=6.

So, the state ψ is in the symmetric subspace.

Now, is ψ an eigenstate of S_total^2?

In the symmetric subspace, the S=3/2 states have eigenvalue S(S+1) ħ² = (3/2)(5/2) ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

The S=1/2 state has eigenvalue (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, ψ must be either in the S=3/2 subspace or in the S=1/2 subspace.

But ψ is symmetric, so it's in the S=3/2 subspace.

Therefore, ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 15/4 ħ².

Thus, going back to H:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9ħ²/4))

So, the expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9ħ²/4) = (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)(3/2 ħ²) = (3/4) A ħ².

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ². Hmm.

There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the state ψ is not in the S=3/2 subspace? But it's symmetric, so it should be. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is wrong.

Wait, let me count how ψ behaves under permutation.

ψ is symmetric, so it's in the symmetric subspace. But perhaps ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2 because of its specific structure.

Alternatively, perhaps ψ is not in the S=3/2 subspace because it has specific quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps compute S_total^2 acting on ψ.

Compute S_total^2 |ψ⟩:

= (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |ψ⟩

= S1² |ψ⟩ + S2² |ψ⟩ + S3² |ψ⟩ + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |ψ⟩

We already have S1² + S2² + S3² acting on |ψ⟩ gives (9ħ²/4) |ψ⟩.

So, that term is 9ħ²/4 |ψ⟩.

Now, compute 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |ψ⟩.

Earlier, I tried to compute this, but it got complicated. Alternatively, maybe think about what this term does.

Each term like S1·S2 can be written as (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²).

Therefore,

2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |ψ⟩ = (S1² + S2² + S1² + S3² + S2² + S3²) |ψ⟩ - (S12² + S13² + S23²) |ψ⟩

= (2S1² + 2S2² + 2S3² - S12² - S13² - S23²) |ψ⟩

Therefore, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = (9ħ²/2 - (⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S13²⟩ + ⟨S23²⟩ )) |ψ⟩

But wait, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then S_total^2 |ψ⟩ must be proportional to |ψ⟩.

But unless (⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S13²⟩ + ⟨S23²⟩ ) is equal to 9ħ²/2, which would make S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = 0, which can't be.

Wait, but earlier, I found that ⟨S12²⟩ = ⟨S13²⟩ = ⟨S23²⟩ = 3/2 ħ².

So, adding them up, 9/2 ħ².

Thus, S_total^2 |ψ⟩ = (9ħ²/2 - 9ħ²/2) |ψ⟩ = 0 |ψ⟩.

But that can't be because S_total^2 is a positive operator.

Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption that ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2 is wrong, despite being symmetric. So, ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, which would mean it's not an eigenstate of H, so it's not an eigenstate of H, but only has a certain expectation value.

But the correct answer says it is an eigenstate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing ⟨S12²⟩.

Wait, let's try this again. When I computed ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩, I assumed that S12² |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of ψ and other states, which complicates things. Maybe it's easier to compute ⟨S12²⟩ by considering the possible states and their contributions.

In the state ψ, each term is two spins up and one spin down. So, for S12², let's compute the expectation value.

The possible states in the computational basis are:

1. |↑↑↓⟩
2. |↑↓↑⟩
3. |↓↑↑⟩

ψ is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

So, compute ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩:

S12² = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Compute each term:

⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ = (3ħ²/4) * 3 = 9ħ²/4. Because S1² is same for all terms, and there are three terms in ψ.

Similarly, ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ = 9ħ²/4.

Now, compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12²).

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = (1/2)(⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ )

So, substituting the known values:

= (1/2)(9ħ²/4 + 9ħ²/4 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

= (1/2)(9ħ²/2 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

Now, compute ⟨ψ| 2 S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = 2 * (1/2)(9ħ²/2 - ⟨S12²⟩ ) = (9ħ²/2 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S12² |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| S1² |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| S2² |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| 2 S1·S2 |ψ⟩

= 9ħ²/4 + 9ħ²/4 + (9ħ²/2 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

So,

⟨S12²⟩ = (9ħ²/4 + 9ħ²/4) + (9ħ²/2 - ⟨S12²⟩ )

= (9ħ²/2) + (9ħ²/2) - ⟨S12²⟩

Thus,

⟨S12²⟩ + ⟨S12²⟩ = 9ħ²

2⟨S12²⟩ = 9ħ²

⟨S12²⟩ = (9/2) ħ²

Wait, same result as before. So, ⟨S12²⟩ = 9/2 ħ². Similarly, ⟨S13²⟩ and ⟨S23²⟩ are also 9/2 ħ².

Therefore, going back to H.

H = (A/2)( S12² + S13² + S23² - 2*(3ħ²/4)*3 )

= (A/2)( (9/2 + 9/2 + 9/2 ) ħ² - 9ħ² )

= (A/2)( (27/2 ħ²) - 9ħ² )

= (A/2)( (27/2 - 18/2) ħ² )

= (A/2)(9/2 ħ²) = (9A/4) ħ²

Wait, but the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ², so 9A/4 is not equal to 2A/3.

Therefore, this suggests that there is a mistake in the calculation. But where?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion of S_total^2.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Another way: compute the expectation value of each term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

Compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

We can write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1² + S2² - S12² )

So,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The spin state is provided as ψ = 1/√3*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find its energy. If not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall what S1, S2, S3 are. Each Si is the spin operator for particle i, which is (1/2) times the Pauli matrices for that particle. So S1 = (ħ/2)σ1, and similarly for S2 and S3.

The state ψ is given as a symmetric combination of three terms. Let me write them out:

1. ↑↑↓
2. ↑↓↑
3. ↓↑↑

Each term has two spins up and one spin down. So the state ψ has two spins up and one spin down in a symmetric way. That suggests it's a state with two spins up and one down, equally weighted across the three possible positions for the down spin.

I think this state is symmetric under permutations of the spins, so it might be an eigenstate of the total spin or some permutation-invariant operator, which could be connected to H.

Since H is a sum of dot products of spin operators, let's try to compute Hψ.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So Hψ = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)ψ

I need to compute each term: S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 acting on ψ.

But before that, maybe it's better to recall that S·S = (1/2)(S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2). Wait, no, that's S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 - (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2))/2? Wait, no, more accurately, for each pair, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2). Wait, perhaps I should not get confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S1·S2 in terms of spin operators. Let me recall that for spin 1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2). So each S_i·S_j is equal to (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2). Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

So for S1·S2, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (3/4)ħ^2 + (3/4)ħ^2 - S_ij^2 ). So S_ij^2 is the square of the total spin operator for particles i and j. Since we have two spin-1/2 particles, S_ij can be either singlet (total spin 0) or triplet (total spin 1). So S_ij^2 can be either 0 or (2ħ)^2 = 4ħ^2, right? Because for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S_ij is either 0 or 1, so S_ij^2 is 0 or (1)^2 * ħ^2? Wait, no, S_ij is in units of ħ. So S_ij^2 would be (S(S+1))ħ^2, so for S=0, it's 0, for S=1, it's 2ħ^2.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4)ħ^2 - S_ij^2 ) = (1/2)( (3/2)ħ^2 - S_ij^2 ). So if S_ij^2 is 0 or 2ħ^2.

Thus, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (3/2)ħ^2 - S_ij^2 ). So if the two spins are in a singlet state (S=0), then S1·S2 = (1/2)(3/2ħ^2 - 0) = (3/4)ħ^2. If they are in a triplet state (S=1), then S1·S2 = (1/2)(3/2ħ^2 - 2ħ^2) = (1/2)(-1/2ħ^2) = (-1/4)ħ^2.

Hmm, interesting. So S1·S2 can take two values: 3/4ħ^2 or -1/4ħ^2 depending on whether the pair is in a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, but in our state ψ, each term is two spins up and one spin down. Let's see: For the first term ↑↑↓, what is the state of particles 1 and 2? They are both up, so that's a triplet state with S=1, so their S1·S2 would be (-1/4)ħ^2.

Similarly, for the second term ↑↓↑, particles 1 and 3 are both up, so again triplet, so S1·S3 = (-1/4)ħ^2.

Third term ↓↑↑, particles 2 and 3 are both up, so triplet, so S2·S3 = (-1/4)ħ^2.

Wait, so in each term of ψ, each pair of spins that are aligned (both up) are in a triplet state, so their S_i·S_j is (-1/4)ħ^2. While the other pairs, which have one up and one down, would be in a singlet state, so their S_i·S_j would be (3/4)ħ^2.

Wait, no, actually, in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so S1·S2 is (-1/4)ħ^2. Particles 1 and 3 are up and down, so their S1·S3 is (3/4)ħ^2. Similarly, for each term:

First term: S1·S2 = (-1/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 = (3/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Second term: S1·S2 = (3/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 = (-1/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Third term: S1·S2 = (3/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 = (3/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 = (-1/4)ħ^2.

Hence, when we compute Hψ, which is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)ψ, each term will contribute A times either (-1/4 or 3/4)ħ^2.

So let's compute each term:

First term:

A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) * (↑↑↓)

= A*( (-1/4)ħ^2 + (3/4)ħ^2 + (3/4)ħ^2 ) * (↑↑↓)

= A*( (-1/4 + 3/4 + 3/4 )ħ^2 ) * (↑↑↓)

= A*( ( (-1 + 3 + 3)/4 )ħ^2 ) * (↑↑↓)

= A*( (5/4)ħ^2 ) * (↑↑↓)

Similarly, second term:

A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) * (↑↓↑)

= A*( (3/4)ħ^2 + (-1/4)ħ^2 + (3/4)ħ^2 ) * (↑↓↑)

= A*( (3/4 - 1/4 + 3/4 )ħ^2 ) * (↑↓↑)

= A*( (5/4)ħ^2 ) * (↑↓↑)

Third term:

A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) * (↓↑↑)

= A*( (3/4)ħ^2 + (3/4)ħ^2 + (-1/4)ħ^2 ) * (↓↑↑)

= A*( (3/4 + 3/4 - 1/4 )ħ^2 ) * (↓↑↑)

= A*( (5/4)ħ^2 ) * (↓↑↑)

Therefore, each term when acted upon by H gives (5/4)A ħ^2 times the respective term.

Therefore, Hψ = (5/4)A ħ^2 ψ.

So ψ is an eigenfunction of H with eigenvalue (5/4)A ħ^2.

But wait, hold on. The answer given was 2/3 A ħ^2. Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me check my calculation again.

First, in the first term, S1·S2 for ↑↑↓: S1·S2 for two up spins. Since they are both up, the total spin S12 is 1, so S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

Each S1^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, so (S1 + S2)^2 = 2ħ^2 (since S12 = 1, so S12^2 = (1)^2 ħ^2 = ħ^2, but wait, no, S12 is the total spin, so S12^2 = (S(S+1))ħ^2, so for S=1, it's 2ħ^2.

So, S1·S2 = [ (2ħ^2) - (3/4)ħ^2 - (3/4)ħ^2 ] / 2 = [ (2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ^2 ] / 2 = (2 - 1.5 ) ħ^2 / 2 = (0.5) ħ^2 / 2 = (1/4) ħ^2.

Wait, but hold on: S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 over 2.

So (S1 + S2)^2 = S12^2 = 2ħ^2.

S1^2 = 3/4 ħ^2, S2^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

So S1·S2 = (2ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2)/2 = (2 - 1.5) ħ^2 / 2 = (0.5) ħ^2 / 2 = 0.25 ħ^2.

So that is (1/4)ħ^2.

Wait, so that contradicts my earlier thought. So when two spins are in a triplet state, S1·S2 is (1/4)ħ^2, not (-1/4)ħ^2.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the sign. Let me double-check.

Suppose S1 and S2 are in a triplet state. Then S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ^2. If they are in a singlet state, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (- 3/2 / 2 ) ħ^2 = (- 3/4 ) ħ^2.

Wait, so that contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, in the triplet state, S1·S2 is ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

(S1 + S2)^2 is S12^2, which is 2ħ^2 (for S=1), so 2ħ^2.

Then, S1·S2 = (2ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 = (2 - 1.5) ħ^2 / 2 = 0.5 ħ^2 / 2 = 0.25 ħ^2. So that is correct.

But in the singlet state, S12 is 0, so S12^2 is 0. So S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2 = (- 6/4 ) / 2 = (- 3/2 ) / 2 = - 3/4 ħ^2.

Wait, so earlier, I thought that Hψ would have contributions of (-1/4)ħ^2 or (3/4)ħ^2, but actually, it's the opposite: triplet gives (1/4)ħ^2 and singlet gives (-3/4)ħ^2.

So in the first term, ↑↑↓: S1·S2 is triplet, so (1/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 is singlet, so (-3/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 is singlet, so (-3/4)ħ^2.

Similarly, in the second term, ↑↓↑: S1·S2 is singlet, (-3/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 is triplet, (1/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 is singlet, (-3/4)ħ^2.

Third term, ↓↑↑: S1·S2 is singlet, (-3/4)ħ^2, S1·S3 is singlet, (-3/4)ħ^2, S2·S3 is triplet, (1/4)ħ^2.

So let me recalculate Hψ:

First term: A*( (1/4) + (-3/4) + (-3/4) ) ħ^2 * (↑↑↓) = A*( (1 - 3 - 3)/4 ) ħ^2 * (↑↑↓) = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 * (↑↑↓)

Second term: A*( (-3/4) + (1/4) + (-3/4) ) ħ^2 * (↑↓↑) = A*( (-3 + 1 - 3)/4 ) ħ^2 * (↑↓↑) = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 * (↑↓↑)

Third term: A*( (-3/4) + (-3/4) + (1/4) ) ħ^2 * (↓↑↑) = A*( (-3 - 3 + 1)/4 ) ħ^2 * (↓↑↑) = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 * (↓↑↑)

Therefore, Hψ = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 [ (↑↑↓) + (↑↓↑) + (↓↑↑) ] / √3

But wait, the state ψ is 1/√3 [ (↑↑↓) + (↑↓↑) + (↓↑↑) ]

Therefore, Hψ = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 ψ.

So that would mean Hψ = (-5/4 A ħ^2) ψ.

But in the given answer, it's said that the eigenvalue is (2/3) A ħ^2.

Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, so my calculation here says that Hψ = (-5/4) A ħ^2 ψ, but the given answer is positive (2/3) A ħ^2. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I have a sign error somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So when S1 and S2 are in triplet, S1·S2 is positive 1/4 ħ^2, and when in singlet, it's -3/4 ħ^2.

But in the state ψ, each term has two spins up and one down. So for a particular pair, if both spins are up, then S_i·S_j is 1/4 ħ^2, else if one is up and the other is down, then S_i·S_j is -3/4 ħ^2.

So in the first term, ↑↑↓: S1·S2 is 1/4 ħ^2, S1·S3 is -3/4 ħ^2, S2·S3 is -3/4 ħ^2. So sum is 1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4 = 1/4 - 6/4 = -5/4. Multiply by A ħ^2.

Second term, ↑↓↑: S1·S2 is -3/4, S1·S3 is 1/4, S2·S3 is -3/4. So same sum: -3/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (-3 +1 -3)/4 = -5/4.

Third term, ↓↑↑: S1·S2 is -3/4, S1·S3 is -3/4, S2·S3 is 1/4. Same sum: -5/4.

So each term when H is applied gives (-5/4 A ħ^2) times each component. So Hψ = (-5/4 A ħ^2) ψ.

But the given answer says it's 2/3 A ħ^2. So I must be wrong somewhere.

Wait, maybe the state isn't ψ = 1/√3(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑), but perhaps there is a different total spin consideration.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the total spin of the system.

Wait, let me think differently. The state ψ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. Let's compute the total spin squared, S_total^2, and see what value it takes.

The total spin S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. So S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

We know S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 )

So H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 )

Now, since ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, if we can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for ψ, then we can compute Hψ.

So let me compute S_total^2 acting on ψ.

In each term of ψ, the spins are two up and one down. Let's see what the total spin is.

In the first term, ↑↑↓: the total spin is S1 + S2 + S3.

Each S_i for up is (1/2)ħ, and for down is (-1/2)ħ.

Wait, no, S_i^z is ± ħ/2, but the spin components in the other directions are involved in the total spin.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for each term in ψ.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to find the total spin of the whole state.

Alternatively, let's note that each term in ψ has S_z = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2, so the total S_z is 1/2. So the state ψ is a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2.

Let me try to find the possible total spin.

If I have three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, is that right? Because for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be S=3/2 (all aligned) or S=1/2 (two aligned and one opposite). So yes, ψ is a state with S=1/2.

So S_total^2 ψ = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ.

Therefore, S_total^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ.

Thus, plugging back into H:

Hψ = (A/2)( (3/4) ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) ψ = (A/2)( -6/4 ħ^2 ) ψ = (A/2)( - 3/2 ħ^2 ) ψ = (- 3/4 A ħ^2 ) ψ.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier result. Wait, now I have two different results for Hψ.

Wait, on one hand, when I computed each term, I got Hψ = (-5/4) A ħ^2 ψ.

On the other hand, computing through S_total^2, I get Hψ = (-3/4) A ħ^2 ψ.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me recast the problem.

Another approach: Let me consider that for the symmetric state ψ, each pair of spins is in a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, but in each term, two spins are up and one is down.

Wait, in the first term, ↑↑↓: spins 1 and 2 are up, so triplet; spins 1 and 3 are up-down, singlet; spins 2 and 3 are up-down, singlet.

So for each term:

S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ^2,

S1·S3 = -3/4 ħ^2,

S2·S3 = -3/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, each term when acted upon by H gives:

H acting on ↑↑↓ is A*(1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ħ^2 = A*(-5/4) ħ^2.

Similarly, H acting on ↑↓↑ is A*(-5/4) ħ^2,

Similarly for the third term.

Hence, Hψ = A*(-5/4) ħ^2 ψ.

But according to the S_total approach, Hψ = (-3/4) A ħ^2 ψ.

So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the S_total^2 approach.

Let me redo the S_total^2 calculation.

From S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Each S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2 ) / 2.

So H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(9/4 ħ^2 ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ^2.

So if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then Hψ = (A/2) (S_total^2 ψ ) - (9/8) A ħ^2 ψ.

Earlier, I thought that S_total^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ because the total spin S=1/2. So S_total^2 ψ = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ.

Therefore, Hψ = (A/2)(3/4 ħ^2 ψ ) - (9/8) A ħ^2 ψ = (3/8 A ħ^2 ) ψ - (9/8 A ħ^2 ) ψ = (-6/8 A ħ^2 ) ψ = (-3/4 A ħ^2 ) ψ.

Hence, Hψ = (-3/4 A ħ^2 ) ψ.

But earlier, when computing term by term, I had Hψ = (-5/4 A ħ^2 ) ψ.

There is a discrepancy here.

Wait, let me check S_total^2 for ψ again.

If ψ has total spin S=1/2, then S_total^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ.

But maybe ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2? Wait, but ψ is symmetric in the spins, so I would think it should be.

Wait, let me compute S_total^2 ψ explicitly.

Compute S_total^2 ψ = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 ψ.

Expanding this, it's S1^2 ψ + S2^2 ψ + S3^2 ψ + 2(S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ )

Each S1^2 ψ = (3/4) ħ^2 ψ, similarly for S2^2 and S3^2.

So S1^2 ψ + S2^2 ψ + S3^2 ψ = 3*(3/4) ħ^2 ψ = (9/4) ħ^2 ψ.

Now, compute S1·S2 ψ.

Wait, we have done that earlier. Each term in ψ is ↑↑↓, ↑↓↑, ↓↑↑. So when S1·S2 acts on each term, depending on whether S1 and S2 are both up or not.

From before, S1·S2 acting on each term gives either (1/4) ħ^2 ψ or (-3/4) ħ^2 ψ, but in this case, when S1 and S2 are up, it's (1/4) ħ^2, else (-3/4).

But in ψ, for each term:

First term: ↑↑↓, S1·S2 gives (1/4) ħ^2.

Second term: ↑↓↑, S1·S2 gives (-3/4) ħ^2.

Third term: ↓↑↑, S1·S2 gives (-3/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, S1·S2 ψ = (1/4 ħ^2) (↑↑↓) + (-3/4 ħ^2) (↑↓↑) + (-3/4 ħ^2) (↓↑↑ )

Similarly, S1·S3 ψ:

First term: ↑↑↓, S1 and S3 are up and down, so S1·S3 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

Second term: ↑↓↑, S1 and S3 are up and up, so S1·S3 = (1/4) ħ^2.

Third term: ↓↑↑, S1 and S3 are down and up, so S1·S3 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

Similarly, S2·S3 ψ:

First term: ↑↑↓, S2 and S3 are up and down, so S2·S3 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

Second term: ↑↓↑, S2 and S3 are down and up, so S2·S3 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

Third term: ↓↑↑, S2 and S3 are up and up, so S2·S3 = (1/4) ħ^2.

So now, S1·S2 ψ = (1/4) (↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S1·S3 ψ = (-3/4)(↑↑↓) + (1/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S2·S3 ψ = (-3/4)(↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) + (1/4)(↓↑↑ )

So, S_total^2 ψ = (9/4) ħ^2 ψ + 2[ S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ ]

Let me compute S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ:

Compute term by term.

First, S1·S2 ψ:

= (1/4) (↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S1·S3 ψ:

= (-3/4)(↑↑↓) + (1/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S2·S3 ψ:

= (-3/4)(↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) + (1/4)(↓↑↑ )

Now, adding them all together:

For ↑↑↓:

(1/4)(↑↑↓) + (-3/4)(↑↑↓) + (-3/4)(↑↑↓) = (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ↑↑↓ = (-5/4) ↑↑↓

For ↑↓↑:

(-3/4)(↑↓↑) + (1/4)(↑↓↑) + (-3/4)(↑↓↑) = (-3/4 + 1/4 - 3/4) ↑↓↑ = (-5/4) ↑↓↑

For ↓↑↑:

(-3/4)(↓↑↑) + (-3/4)(↓↑↑) + (1/4)(↓↑↑) = (-3/4 - 3/4 + 1/4) ↓↑↑ = (-5/4) ↓↑↑

So S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ = (-5/4)(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑ ) = (-5/4) ψ.

Therefore, S_total^2 ψ = (9/4) ħ^2 ψ + 2*(-5/4) ħ^2 ψ = (9/4 - 10/4 ) ħ^2 ψ = (-1/4) ħ^2 ψ.

Wait, so S_total^2 ψ = (-1/4) ħ^2 ψ.

But S_total^2 must be a positive operator, so how can S_total^2 ψ be negative?

Wait, that can't be right. S_total^2 is a positive semi-definite operator because it's the square of the total spin, which is always non-negative. So S_total^2 ψ should be non-negative. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. When I added S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ, I obtained (-5/4) ψ, but is that correct?

Wait, let me recompute.

Compute each component:

Compute S1·S2 ψ:

= (1/4)(↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S1·S3 ψ:

= (-3/4)(↑↑↓) + (1/4)(↑↓↑) - (3/4)(↓↑↑ )

S2·S3 ψ:

= (-3/4)(↑↑↓) - (3/4)(↑↓↑) + (1/4)(↓↑↑ )

Adding S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ:

For ↑↑↓:

(1/4)(↑↑↓) + (-3/4)(↑↑↓) + (-3/4)(↑↑↓) = (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) = (-5/4)(↑↑↓)

For ↑↓↑:

(-3/4)(↑↓↑) + (1/4)(↑↓↑) + (-3/4)(↑↓↑) = (-3/4 + 1/4 - 3/4) = (-5/4)(↑↓↑)

For ↓↑↑:

(-3/4)(↓↑↑) + (-3/4)(↓↑↑) + (1/4)(↓↑↑) = (-3/4 - 3/4 + 1/4) = (-5/4)(↓↑↑)

So yes, the sum is (-5/4)(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑ ) = (-5/4)ψ.

So S1·S2 ψ + S1·S3 ψ + S2·S3 ψ = (-5/4)ψ.

Thus, S_total^2 ψ = (9/4 - 10/4 ) ħ^2 ψ = (-1/4) ħ^2 ψ.

This is impossible because S_total^2 is positive.

So I must have made a mistake in some computation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in S1·S2 ψ.

Wait, S1·S2 ψ = A*(S1·S2)ψ, but wait, no, S1·S2 is an operator, not A times that. I think I confused Hψ with S1·S2 ψ. No, actually, in S_total^2 ψ, we have S1·S2 ψ, not A times that. So I shouldn't be using the previous Hψ coefficients.

Wait, perhaps this is the issue. Let me clarify:

When I computed S1·S2 ψ, I was using the matrix elements of S1·S2 acting on the basis states. But in reality, when I did that earlier, I used the fact that S1·S2 on ↑↑↓ is (1/4 ħ^2) ↑↑↓, but perhaps that is incorrect because S1·S2 is not diagonal in this basis.

Wait, hold on. S1·S2 is a scalar operator, but when acting on a basis state, it might not just scale the state.

Wait, that's a good point. I think I made the mistake of assuming that S1·S2 acting on a state with two up and one down just scales the state, but that is not necessarily the case.

Because S1·S2 is not diagonal in this basis, so when you apply S1·S2 to a state, you might get a combination of other states, not just scaling.

So my earlier assumption that S1·S2 ψ is proportional to ψ is incorrect. That's why when I tried to compute S_total^2 ψ, I ended up with a negative eigenvalue, which cannot be.

So, perhaps I
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, find its energy. If not, I have to find the expectation value of the energy.

First, let me recall what spin operators do. Each Si is the spin operator for particle i. The dot product S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z. But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the total spin squared operator. Because S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Yeah, that's a useful identity. So, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Similarly for the other terms.

So, if I can compute S_total^2 for this state, then I can express each S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 in terms of S_total^2 and the individual spin squares. Then, H can be rewritten as A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Wait, maybe I should compute each term separately.

But let me think about the state psi. It's a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, each term has two up spins and one down spin, each in a different position. So, the state has total spin S_total^2 eigenvalue. Since the state is symmetric under permutation of spins, it's probably in a symmetric spin state.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin S_total can be either 3/2 or 1/2. For three particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (if all three are aligned) or 1/2 (if one is down and two are up, or other combinations). Since our state has two spins up and one spin down, which is a singlet-like state but for three particles, it must correspond to spin 1/2 total.

So, S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So, S_total^2 is 3/4 ħ². But let me verify that.

Wait, the state psi is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). This is symmetric under permutation, so it's in a symmetric representation. For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric spin states are the triplet states with S=3/2 and the singlet state with S=1/2. Since this state is symmetric and has two up and one down, it can't be the fully symmetric triplet state, which is all spins up. So, it's probably in the spin 1/2 representation.

Therefore, S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So, S_total^2 = 3 ħ² /4.

So, with that, let's express each S_i·S_j term.

First, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Similarly for the others.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ] )

Simplify each term:

Each S_i·S_j term gives (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So adding the three terms:

( [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2] + [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2] + [S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2] ) / 2.

That would be [3 S_total^2 - 2 S1^2 - 2 S2^2 - 2 S3^2]/2.

So, H = A * [3 S_total^2 - 2 (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2.

Now, each S_i^2 is (3/4) ħ², since for spin 1/2 particles, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

So, plugging that back in:

H = A * [ 3*(3/4) ħ² - 2*(9/4) ħ² ] / 2.

Compute numerator:

3*(3/4) = 9/4, 2*(9/4) = 18/4 = 9/2.

So, 9/4 ħ² - 9/2 ħ² = (9/4 - 18/4) ħ² = (-9/4) ħ².

Therefore, H = A*(-9/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-9/8) ħ².

Wait, but this can't be right, because according to the given correct answer, it's 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expectation value of H in the state psi.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, the expectation value <H> is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ).

Since the state is symmetric, the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, etc., should all be equal.

So, maybe I can compute <S1·S2> and multiply by 3, then multiply by A.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2) <S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2> = (1/2) ( <S_total^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> )

So, I need to find <S_total^2> and <S1^2>, <S2^2>.

Earlier, I thought that S_total^2 = 3/4 ħ², so <S_total^2> = 3/4 ħ².

And <S1^2> = (3/4) ħ², same for S2^2, S3^2.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( 3/4 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ² = (1/2)( -3/4 ) ħ² = -3/8 ħ².

So, the total expectation value is 3*(-3/8) ħ² = -9/8 ħ².

So, <H> = A*(-9/8) ħ².

But the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, that's a big discrepancy. So, either my calculation is wrong, or my assumption about S_total^2 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated <S_total^2>. Let's think again.

The state psi is symmetric, but is it in the triplet state or the singlet state?

Wait, three spin 1/2 particles: the possible total spin states are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

The triplet state (S=3/2) is fully symmetric, symmetric under permutation.

The singlet state (S=1/2) is antisymmetric? No, wait, for three particles, the singlet state is symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, for two particles, spin 1/2: triplet symmetric, singlet antisymmetric.

For three particles, the symmetric states are the triplet (S=3/2) and another symmetric state with S=1/2. The antisymmetric states come from other representations perhaps, but I might be confusing.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states are:

- The totally symmetric state, which is all spins up.

- The state with two spins up and one spin down, which is the same as the given state psi, which is symmetric.

These correspond to S=3/2 and S=1/2, respectively.

So, the given state psi is in the S=1/2 representation.

Thus, S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

So, that part is correct.

But earlier, when I tried to compute <H>, I got -9/8 A ħ², but the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when I wrote H, I made a mistake.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Each S_i·S_j is (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, <S2·S3> separately using the state psi.

But since the state is symmetric, all these expectation values should be equal. So, maybe I can compute one of them and multiply by three.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

Remember, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, the expectation value <S1·S2> = (1/2)( <S1^+ S2^-> + <S1^- S2^+> ) + <S1^z S2^z>.

Let me compute each term.

First, <S1^+ S2^-> is the expectation value of S1^+ acting on particle 1, and S2^- acting on particle 2.

Similarly, <S1^- S2^+> is the expectation value of S1^- acting on particle 1, and S2^+ acting on particle 2.

< S1^z S2^z > is the expectation value of S1^z times S2^z.

So, let's compute each component.

First, since the state psi is a sum of terms with two up and one down.

Each term in psi has specific spins for each particle.

Let me label the computational basis states as |up> = |↑>, |down> = |↓>.

So, the state psi is (1/sqrt(3)) ( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ).

So, now, to compute <S1^+ S2^->, let's think about what S1^+ does. S1^+ |↑> = 0, and S1^+ |↓> = ħ |↑>.

Similarly, S2^- |↑> = 0, S2^- |↓> = ħ |↑>.

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- acting on |↑↑↓> is S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↑↓> = 0 ⊗ 0 = 0.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓↑> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = 0.

S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑> = S1^+ |↓> ⊗ S2^- |↑↑> = ħ |↑> ⊗ 0 = 0.

So, S1^+ S2^- psi = 0. Therefore, <S1^+ S2^-> = 0.

Similarly, compute <S1^- S2^+>. Let's compute S1^- S2^+ acting on psi.

S1^- |↑> = 0, S1^- |↓> = -ħ |↑>.

Similarly, S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↓>, S2^+ |↓> = 0.

So, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓> = S1^- |↑> ⊗ S2^+ |↑↓> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↓> = ħ |↑↓>.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↓↑> = S1^- |↑> ⊗ S2^+ |↓↑> = 0 ⊗ 0 = 0.

S1^- S2^+ |↓↑↑> = S1^- |↓> ⊗ S2^+ |↑↑> = (-ħ)|↑> ⊗ ħ |↓> = -ħ^2 |↑↓>.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ psi = (1/sqrt(3)) ( ħ |↑↓> + 0 - ħ^2 |↑↓> ).

So, S1^- S2^+ psi = ( ħ - ħ^2 ) |↑↓> / sqrt(3).

Therefore, the expectation value <S1^- S2^+> is the coefficient of |↑↓> times ħ^2.

Wait, but the state after S1^- S2^+ is ( ħ |↑↓> - ħ^2 |↑↓> ) / sqrt(3). So, the coefficient is ( ħ - ħ^2 ).

But expectation value is the inner product of psi with S1^- S2^+ psi.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix element <psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi>.

Let me write psi as (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ).

Compute <psi | S1^- S2^+ |psi>.

First, S1^- S2^+ |psi> is S1^- S2^+ multiplied by psi.

From above, S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (1/sqrt(3))( ħ |↑↓> - ħ^2 |↑↓> ).

So, S1^- S2^+ |psi> = ( ħ (1 - ħ ) ) |↑↓> / sqrt(3).

Therefore, the inner product <psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi> is (1/sqrt(3)) ( <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ) times ( ħ (1 - ħ ) |↑↓> / sqrt(3) ).

So, this is ħ (1 - ħ ) / 3 * ( <↑↑↓|↑↓> + <↑↓↑|↑↓> + <↓↑↑|↑↓> ).

Now, <↑↑↓|↑↓> is 0 because the first particle is up and the second is up in the first state, and up and down in the second state.

Similarly, <↑↓↑|↑↓> is 0 because the first particle is up and up, but the second is down and down.

Same for <↓↑↑|↑↓> is 0.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, <↑↑↓|↑↓> is the inner product of (up, up, down) with (up, down, down). Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, |↑↑↓> is (up, up, down). |↑↓> is (up, down). So, if I take <↑↑↓|↑↓>, that would actually be 0 because they're different states in the first two particles.

Wait, no, wait, |↑↑↓> is a three-particle state, and |↑↓> is a two-particle state. So, when we take the inner product, we have to check if the first two particles match.

But in the state |↑↑↓>, the first two are up, up. In |↑↓>, the first two are up, down. So, these are not the same.

Similarly, <↑↓↑|↑↓> is the inner product of (up, down, up) with (up, down). Again, first two particles are up, down in both, so <up, down|up, down> is 1, and the third particle in the first state is up, but in |↑↓> it's arbitrary? Wait, no. Actually, wait, |↑↓> is a two-particle state, so when taking inner product with a three-particle state, it's like (⟨up|⊗⟨up|) |↑↑↓> ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps in the inner product <↑↑↓|↑↓>, actually, |↑↑↓> is (up, up, down), and |↑↓> is (up, down). So, the inner product is (⟨up| ⊗ ⟨up|) |↑↑↓> = ⟨up|up⟩ * ⟨up|up⟩ * ⟨down|down⟩.

No, wait, actually, in this context, |↑↓> is a two-particle state, so to take the inner product with |↑↑↓>, it's like (⟨up| ⊗ ⟨up|) on the first two particles, and ⟨down| on the third.

But |↑↑↓> has particles 1: up, 2: up, 3: down. So, (⟨up|up⟩)(⟨up|up⟩)(⟨down|down⟩) = 1*1*1 =1. But |↑↓> is (up, down), which in three particles, if we consider it as (up, down, something), the inner product would require that the third particle is also in a specific state. So, to compute <↑↑↓|↑↓>, you have to have the same third particle? Wait, actually, no.

Wait, I think my confusion arises because |↑↓> is a two-particle state, whereas |↑↑↓> is a three-particle state. So, when you take the inner product, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute in the entire three-particle space. So, perhaps I should write |↑↓> as |↑↓>_1 |any>_2 |any>_3? No, that's not correct. Because |↑↓> is specifically a two-particle state, but in our three-particle system, we need to treat them as entangled. So, perhaps the inner product <↑↑↓|↑↓> is zero because they are in different spaces.

Wait, perhaps I should represent |↑↓> as a three-particle state with the third particle in a specific state. Wait, no. |↑↓> is for two particles, but in our three-particle system, we can only have all three particles in the state. Therefore, perhaps |↑↓> is not a valid state in the three-particle system, unless we consider it as |↑↓|any>.

Wait, maybe this approach is not the best.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state |↑↑↓> has S1 = up, S2 = up, S3 = down. Similarly, |↑↓↑> is S1 = up, S2 = down, S3 = up.

So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓> would flip the second spin: S2 is up, so S2^- |↑> = 0, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓> = 0.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> would flip the second spin (which is down) to up, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = ħ |↑↑>.

Wait, that's not correct because S2^- |↓> = ħ |↑>, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = ħ |↑↑>.

But in our state, |↑↓↑> is (up, down, up). So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = (S1^+ |↑>) ⊗ (S2^- |↓>) = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = ħ |↑↑>.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓> = S1^- |↑> ⊗ S2^+ |↑> = (-ħ)|↓> ⊗ ħ |↓> = -ħ^2 |↓↓>.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when computing S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓>.

Let me correct that.

Compute S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓>:

S1^- |↑> = -ħ |↓>, S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↓>. Therefore, S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓> = (-ħ |↓>) ⊗ (ħ |↓>) = -ħ^2 |↓↓>.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↓↑> = S1^- |↑> ⊗ S2^+ |↓> = (-ħ)|↓> ⊗ 0 = 0.

S1^- S2^+ |↓↑↑> = S1^- |↓> ⊗ S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↑> ⊗ ħ |↓> = ħ^2 |↑↓>.

So, S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) ( -ħ^2 |↓↓> + 0 + ħ^2 |↑↓> ).

So, the state after S1^- S2^+ is ( ħ^2 |↑↓> - ħ^2 |↓↓> ) / sqrt(3).

Therefore, the inner product <psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi> is (1/sqrt(3))( <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ) times ( ħ^2 |↑↓> - ħ^2 |↓↓> ) / sqrt(3).

So, let's compute each term:

<↑↑↓|↑↓> = 0 because first two particles are up, up vs. up, down.

<↑↑↓|↓↓> = 0 because first two are up, up vs. down, down.

Similarly, <↑↓↑|↑↓> = 0 because first two are up, down vs. up, down? Wait, no.

Wait, first term is <↑↑↓| acting on |↑↓>:

= ⟨up, up, down | up, down⟩ ?

Wait, no, in the computational basis, |↑↑↓> is a three-particle state, and |↑↓> is a two-particle state. So, their inner product is zero, because they have different numbers of particles.

Wait, no, in reality, in the three-particle space, |↑↑↓> is a specific state, and |↑↓> is a two-particle state which can be thought of as |↑↓⟩|any⟩, but it's actually entangled. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the notation.

Wait, no. Actually, in the three-particle Hilbert space, |↑↓> is not a pure three-particle state; it's a two-particle state embedded within the three-particle space. So, the inner product ⟨↑↑↓|↑↓⟩ is zero because the first two particles in the first state are up, up and in the second state are up, down.

But in reality, in three-particle space, |↑↓> is a state where particles 1 and 2 are up and down, but particle 3 is in an unspecified state. Wait, actually, no, because in our problem, the state |↑↓> doesn't have a defined state for particle 3.

Wait, perhaps this approach is too confusing. Maybe I should use the fact that the state |↑↑↓> is orthogonal to any state where particles 1 and 2 are not both up.

But maybe instead, think about the expectation value.

Wait, since the state psi is symmetric, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for each pair, the expectation value of S1·S2 is the same.

Alternatively, let me compute <S1·S2>.

We have S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) + S1^z S2^z.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( <S1^+ S2^-> + <S1^- S2^+> ) + <S1^z S2^z>.

We have already computed <S1^+ S2^-> = 0, because when we computed S1^+ S2^- psi, it gave zero. Wait, but when I did the computation earlier, I think I messed up.

Wait, hold on. Let me go back.

Earlier, when I tried to compute S1^+ S2^- psi, I thought it gave zero, but now I see that S1^- S2^+ psi gives some non-zero term.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute <S1^+ S2^-> and <S1^- S2^+> separately.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think about the spin correlation.

Given that the state is two up and one down, the expectation value of S_i^z is (1/2) for particles 1 and 2, and (-1/2) for particle 3. So, <S1^z> = 1/2, <S2^z> = 1/2, <S3^z> = -1/2.

The expectation value of S1^z S2^z is <S1^z><S2^z> + something. Wait, no. Actually, S1^z S2^z is just the product of their z-components.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(-1/2)? Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Let me think.

Each spin can be up or down, with up corresponding to +1/2 and down to -1/2.

So, the state psi has terms with (up, up, down), (up, down, up), and (down, up, up).

So, for each term, compute S1^z S2^z.

First term: (up, up, down) -> S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4.

Second term: (up, down, up) -> S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/4).

Third term: (down, up, up) -> S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/4).

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> is average of these three: (1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4))/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12.

Now, for the ladder terms.

Compute <S1^+ S2^-> and <S1^- S2^+>.

Let me try again. The operator S1^+ S2^- acts on the state |↑↑↓> as follows:

S1^+ |↑> = 0, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓> = 0.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = ħ |↑↑>.

Wait, but |↑↓↑> is (up, down, up). So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑> = S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓> = 0 ⊗ ħ |↑> = ħ |↑↑>.

But in the state psi, the coefficient of |↑↑> is zero because all terms have either two up and one down.

Wait, no, in the state psi, each term is |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>, so in the state psi, there is no |↑↑> component. So, when S1^+ S2^- acts on |↑↑↓>, it gives 0, on |↑↓↑> it gives ħ |↑↑>, and on |↓↑↑> it gives 0.

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- psi = (1/sqrt(3))(0 + ħ |↑↑> + 0 ) = ħ |↑↑> / sqrt(3).

Thus, <S1^+ S2^-> = ħ <psi | ↑↑> / sqrt(3).

But wait, <psi | ↑↑> is the coefficient of |↑↑> in psi, which is zero because psi only has |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>.

Therefore, <S1^+ S2^-> = 0.

Similarly, compute <S1^- S2^+>.

The operator S1^- S2^+ acts on |↑↑↓>:

S1^- |↑> = -ħ |↓>, S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↓>, so S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓> = (-ħ |↓>) ⊗ (ħ |↓>) = -ħ^2 |↓↓>.

On |↑↓↑>:

S1^- |↑> = -ħ |↓>, S2^+ |↓> = 0, so S1^- S2^+ |↑↓↑> = -ħ |↓> ⊗ 0 = 0.

On |↓↑↑>:

S1^- |↓> = ħ |↑>, S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↓>, so S1^- S2^+ |↓↑↑> = (ħ |↑>) ⊗ (ħ |↓>) = ħ^2 |↑↓>.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ psi = (1/sqrt(3))( -ħ^2 |↓↓> + 0 + ħ^2 |↑↓> ) = ħ^2 ( |↑↓> - |↓↓> ) / sqrt(3).

But wait, psi is a three-particle state, so |↑↓> is a two-particle state, but here we have a three-particle state |↑↓> which is ambiguous. Wait, actually, in our three-particle system, |↑↓> is not a pure three-particle state, so when we write |↑↓> as part of a three-particle state, we need to make it explicit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Wait, in fact, when we have a three-particle state and apply S1^- S2^+ to it, it's supposed to give another three-particle state. So, when we compute S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓>, as I did earlier, we have to consider the entire three-particle state.

So, if |↑↑↓> is (up, up, down), applying S1^- S2^+ gives:

S1^- |↑> = -ħ |↓>, S2^+ |↑> = ħ |↓>, so S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓> = (-ħ |↓>) ⊗ (ħ |↓>) = -ħ^2 |↓↓>.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↓↑> = (-ħ |↓>) ⊗ (S2^+ |↓>) = (-ħ |↓>) ⊗ 0 = 0.

S1^- S2^+ |↓↑↑> = (S1^- |↓>) ⊗ (S2^+ |↑>) = (ħ |↑>) ⊗ (ħ |↓>) = ħ^2 |↑↓>.

Therefore, as above, S1^- S2^+ psi = (1/sqrt(3))( -ħ^2 |↓↓> + 0 + ħ^2 |↑↓> ) / sqrt(3).

But wait, |↑↓> is a two-particle state. So, in the three-particle space, how do we represent this? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of expectation values.

Wait, maybe it's better to note that the state is symmetric, so the expectation value of S1·S2 is the same as for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Thus, the total expectation value <H> = A*(3 <S1·S2> ).

Therefore, if I can compute <S1·S2>, then multiply by 3 and by A, I can get the expectation value.

So, we already have:

<S1^z S2^z> = -1/12.

And the ladder terms: <S1^+ S2^-> = 0, and <S1^- S2^+> = ?

Wait, perhaps the ladder terms can be computed via:

For the term <S1^- S2^+>, when we have S1^- S2^+ |psi>, it gives a combination of |↑↓> and |↓↓> as above.

But how does this relate to <S1^- S2^+>?

Wait, perhaps I should compute <psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi>.

From above, S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (1/sqrt(3))( -ħ^2 |↓↓> + ħ^2 |↑↓> ).

So, inner product <psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi> = (1/3)( -ħ^2 <↑↑↓|↓↓> + ħ^2 <↑↑↓|↑↓> + same for other terms).

But as before, <↑↑↓|↑↓> is zero because |↑↑↓> is a three-particle state with first two up, and |↑↓> is a two-particle state.

Similarly, <↑↑↓|↓↓> is zero because first two are up, and third is down, while |↓↓> is a two-particle state with down, down, but in three particles, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me note that in the state psi, the total spin is S=1/2, so S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Moreover, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed in terms of S_total^2.

We have the identity:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3:


--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I've got this problem here about spin 1/2 particles and a Hamiltonian. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, the setup: There are 3 spin-1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state we're looking at is psi, which is (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what its energy is. If not, we need the expectation value of the energy. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with energy (2/3)*A*hbar², but I need to figure out why.

Okay, so let me recall some basics about spin systems. Spin-1/2 particles have spin operators S_i, which are vectors in the Hilbert space. The dot product S_i·S_j is a scalar operator, and for spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices or more simply, we can use the identity that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2. Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, substituting that into the expression for S_i·S_j, we get:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²)/2
= (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2 ħ²)/2
= (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4) ħ².

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Hmm, no, maybe I messed up the constants. Let me go step by step.

We know that S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2].

Since S_i and S_j are spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Similarly, S_j^2 is the same. So,

S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²)]
= (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2 ħ²)].

So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4) ħ².

Okay, that seems correct.

Now, the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, each term is S_i·S_j.

So, H can be written as A*(sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j). So, maybe H = A * [S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3].

Another thought: For three spins, the total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(sum S_i·S_j). So, sum S_i·S_j = (S^2 - sum S_i^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) = A*( (S^2 - sum S_i^2)/2 ).

Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ², so sum S_i^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, H = A*( (S^2 - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 ) = (A/2)*S^2 - (A/2)*(9/4)ħ².

So, H = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

Interesting. So, if I can diagonalize H in terms of S^2, that might help. So, H is expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Now, eigenstates of S^2 are the states with definite total spin, i.e., singlet (S=0) and triplet states (S=1).

So, if psi is an eigenstate of S^2, then it would be an eigenstate of H. So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S^2 for psi, then I can compute the energy.

Alternatively, since H is a sum of dot products, maybe we can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j in psi, multiply by A, and sum them up.

Wait, maybe that's a more straightforward approach.

Given that psi is (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3).

Let me see, maybe I can compute S_i·S_j for each pair (i,j) and then compute the expectation value <psi| S_i·S_j |psi> for each pair, then sum them up and multiply by A.

But let me think about how to compute <S_i·S_j>. Since S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^ + S_j^- + S_i^- + S_j^+) times some terms? Hmm, no, perhaps it's better to recall that for spin 1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ). So, we can compute the expectation value as:

< S_i·S_j > = (1/2) [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - < S_i^2 > - < S_j^2 > ].

We know that S_i^2 and S_j^2 are each (3/4) ħ². So, for each pair (i,j), < S_i·S_j > = (1/2)[ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) ] = (1/2)[ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - 3/2 ħ² ].

So, if I can compute <(S_i + S_j)^2> for each pair, then I can find < S_i·S_j >.

But computing <(S_i + S_j)^2> for the state psi: that would be the expectation value of (S_i + S_j)^2 in the state psi.

Since (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i·S_j, so that might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about how the state psi behaves under the action of the spin operators.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term individually.

Let me think about each term. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, we need to compute three expectation values: <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3>.

Given that, let's pick one pair at a time. Let's compute <S1·S2>.

For spin 1/2 particles, S1 and S2 are each 1/2 in magnitude, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^ + S2^- + S1^- S2^ + S1^2 + S2^2)/something? Wait, maybe that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that S1·S2 can be written as (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we can compute the expectation value of each component.

Let me note that in the state psi, each term is a product of spins for particles 1, 2, and 3.

Given that, the state is symmetric in some way, but let's see:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, each term has two up spins and one down spin, with the down spin in a different position each time.

So, for example, the first term is up up down, the second is up down up, the third is down up up.

So, in each term, we have two up and one down.

Now, let me write the expectation value <S1·S2>.

Since S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)/2? Wait, no, S1·S2 is S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

But actually, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ).

Wait, perhaps that identity will be more useful. So, as I had before:

< S1·S2 > = (1/2) [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - < S1² > - < S2² > ]

We know that <S1²> = <S2²> = (3/4) ħ².

So, if I can compute <(S1 + S2)^2>, then I can get the expectation value.

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2, so <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>. Hmm, that would lead us in circles. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <S1·S2> directly by evaluating the expectation value.

So, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we can compute each term separately.

So, let's write each component:

1. <S1^x S2^x>
2. <S1^y S2^y>
3. <S1^z S2^z>

Then sum them up.

Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1^a S2^a can be computed using the singlet and triplet states.

The singlet state has total spin S=0, and the triplet states have S=1.

Our state psi, however, isn't symmetric or antisymmetric, so it's not necessarily a singlet or triplet state.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute each expectation value explicitly.

Let me consider the state |↑↑↓⟩. Let me write it as |ψ1⟩.

Similarly, |↑↓↑⟩ = |ψ2⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ = |ψ3⟩.

So, psi = (|ψ1⟩ + |ψ2⟩ + |ψ3⟩)/sqrt(3).

Compute <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi>, and similarly for y and z.

Wait, maybe it's easier to note that S1^x S2^x is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) tensor product |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, S1^x is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2), right? Similarly for S2^x.

So, S1^x S2^x = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2) ⊗ (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2).

So, S1^x S2^x is a sum of four terms:

1. |↑↑⟩⟨↓↓|
2. |↑↓⟩⟨↑↓|
3. |↓↑⟩⟨↑↓|
4. |↓↓⟩⟨↓↑|

But since we are working with three particles, I need to be careful about which spins we are operating on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value < S1^x S2^x > by evaluating how psi interacts with these terms.

Wait, let me think: for each term in psi, like |↑↑↓⟩, what happens when we apply S1^x S2^x?

Well, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩:

First, S2^x |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/sqrt(2) ? Wait, no. S^x for spin-up is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2). So, S2^x acting on |↑⟩ is (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/sqrt(2). Similarly, S1^x acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it step by step.

S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x ( S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ )

= S1^x ( |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ) / sqrt(2) |↑↑↓⟩

Wait, no, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = [ |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Compute each term:

First term: |↑⟩⟨↓| acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is |↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩, which is |↑↑⟩⊗|↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩? Wait, no.

Wait, hold on, the ket is |↑↑↓⟩, which is a three-spin state: first spin up, second spin up, third spin down.

So, |↑↑↓⟩ is |1↑⟩ |2↑⟩ |3↓⟩.

So, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = ( |1↑⟩⟨↓| |2↑⟩ |3↓⟩ + |1↑⟩ |2↓⟩⟨↑| |3↓⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, maybe that's too verbose. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that S_i^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2) and S_i^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩ / sqrt(2).

Therefore, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x ( S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ )

= S1^x ( (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2) |↑↑↓⟩ )

= S1^x ( |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) + |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) )

= S1^x ( |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) + |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) )

Compute each term:

First term: S1^x |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2).

S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2). So, S1^x |↑⟩⟨↓| = ⟨↓| S1^x |↑⟩ = ⟨↓| (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no: Wait, S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2). So, (S1^x |↑⟩)⟨↓| = |↓⟩⟨↓| / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me do it step by step.

Compute S1^x (|↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

First, let me denote |↑↑↓⟩ as a three-spin state.

So, S1^x acts on the first spin. So, S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, ⟨↓| S1^x |↑⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) ⟨↓| ↓⟩.

Wait, no, S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2). So, S1^x |↑⟩⟨↓| = |↓⟩⟨↓| / sqrt(2).

Therefore, S1^x (|↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = ( |↓⟩⟨↓| / sqrt(2) ) |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) = |↓⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ / 2.

Similarly, the second term:

S1^x (|↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨↑| S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) ⟨↑| ↓⟩ = 0.

Wait, no, S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ / sqrt(2), but S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨↑| S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑| (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩ = 0, since ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, the second term becomes zero.

So, putting it all together, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ / 2 + 0.

Which is |↓↓⟩⟨↓↓| / 2 tensor |↑↑↓⟩? Wait, no, perhaps I need to track tensor products properly.

Wait, no, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ is |↓⟩⟨↓| / 2 ⊗ |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, let me think again. S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ is S1^x ( S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ ). As above, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ is ( |↑↑↑⟩ + |↓↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no: S2^x acts on the second spin. So, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/sqrt(2) |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is ( |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Compute each term:

First term: |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑⟩⟨↓| |↓⟩ = |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ ⟨↓| = |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓|.

Second term: |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩⟨↑| |↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑|.

So, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = ( |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓| + |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑| ) / sqrt(2).

Then, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x [ ( |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓| + |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑| ) / sqrt(2) ]

Compute each term:

First term: S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓| / sqrt(2).

S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓| = (|↓⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩ ⟨↓|.

Which is (|↓⟩⟨↓| / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, the second term: S1^x |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑| / sqrt(2).

S1^x |↓↑↓⟩ = (|↑⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↓↑↓⟩.

So, S1^x |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑| = (|↑⟩ / sqrt(2)) |↓↑↓⟩ ⟨↑|.

Which is (|↑⟩⟨↑| / sqrt(2)) |↓↑↓⟩.

Putting it all together, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↓| / sqrt(2)) |↑↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2) + (|↑⟩⟨↑| / sqrt(2)) |↓↑↓⟩ / sqrt(2).

Simplifying:

= (|↓⟩⟨↓| / 2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (|↑⟩⟨↑| / 2) |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, this is an operator acting on |↑↑↓⟩, so its action is to take |↑↑↓⟩ and project it onto |↓⟩⟨↓| scaled by 1/2, and similarly for |↓↑↓⟩.

But perhaps instead of computing S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩, it's better to compute the expectation value < S1^x S2^x >.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe instead of computing all this, use the fact that the state is symmetric under cyclic permutations.

Wait, let me note that the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles 1, 2, and 3 in a cyclic way. For example, exchanging 1 and 2 gives |↑↓↑⟩, which is part of the state. Similarly for other permutations.

So, maybe the S_i·S_j expectation values are the same for each pair, i.e., <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>.

If that's the case, then H = A*(3 <S1·S2> ), so H psi = 3A <S1·S2> psi.

Therefore, if I can compute <S1·S2>, I can find the expectation value of H, and if H psi is proportional to psi, then psi is an eigenstate.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

As above, S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). So, we can compute each component's expectation value.

Let me compute each term:

1. <S1^x S2^x>
2. <S1^y S2^y>
3. <S1^z S2^z>

Starting with <S1^z S2^z>:

S1^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, S1^z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^z |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^z |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩.

= |↑⟩⊗|↑⟩⊗|↓⟩.

Similarly, when we compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>, it's the probability of both spins 1 and 2 being up.

In the state psi, each term is two ups and one down. So, in each term, spin 1 and 2 can be up or down.

Let's see, in |↑↑↓⟩, spins 1 and 2 are up. In |↑↓↑⟩, spin 1 is up, spin 2 is down. In |↓↑↑⟩, spin 1 is down, spin 2 is up.

So, in each term, for each possible state in psi, we can compute the value of S1^z S2^z.

But since S1^z and S2^z are diagonal in the computational basis, their expectation value is the probability that spin 1 is up and spin 2 is up.

So, <S1^z S2^z> is the probability that both spins 1 and 2 are up.

Looking at psi: it's (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Each term has two ups and one down.

In |↑↑↓⟩, spins 1 and 2 are up. In |↑↓↑⟩, spin 1 is up, spin 2 is down. In |↓↑↑⟩, spin 1 is down, spin 2 is up.

So, in two of the three terms, spins 1 and 2 are in a state where S1^z S2^z = +1 (i.e., both up or both down). Wait, no. S1^z S2^z is +1 if both up or both down.

But in |↑↑↓⟩, they are both up, so S1^z S2^z = 1.

In |↑↓↑⟩, S1^z = 1, S2^z = -1, so S1^z S2^z = -1.

Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, S1^z = -1, S2^z = 1, so S1^z S2^z = -1.

So, each term contributes as follows:

|↑↑↓⟩: contributes 1.

|↑↓↑⟩: contributes -1.

|↓↑↑⟩: contributes -1.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = [1 + (-1) + (-1)] / 3 = (-1)/3.

Wait, but actually, since S1^z S2^z is being evaluated in the state psi, which is an equal superposition of these three terms. So, the expectation value is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by the expectation value in each term.

But in each term, S1^z S2^z is either 1 or -1.

But in each term, the expectation value is just the value itself because the states are eigenstates of S1^z S2^z.

Wait, no. Wait, the state psi is a superposition of three states, each of which is an eigenstate of S1^z S2^z. So, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each term multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, in |↑↑↓⟩, which occurs with coefficient 1/sqrt(3), S1^z S2^z = 1.

In |↑↓↑⟩, which occurs with coefficient 1/sqrt(3), S1^z S2^z = -1.

Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, S1^z S2^z = -1.

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(-1) = (1 -1 -1)/3 = (-1)/3.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/3.

Hmm, so that's one component done.

Now, moving on to <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>.

Let me compute <S1^x S2^x> first.

As I tried earlier, computing it directly is a bit tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a state can be found using the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in the singlet state, which is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), the expectation value of S1·S2 is -3/4 ħ².

In the triplet states, which are symmetric, like |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩, and |↓↓⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 is +1/4 ħ².

Wait, but our state psi isn't one of these, it's a different combination.

Wait, but maybe I can express psi in terms of the singlet and triplet states.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the state psi is symmetric under cyclic permutations, maybe we can find the expectation value of S1·S2.

Wait, but S1·S2 is not symmetric; it's symmetric in a sense, but not cyclic.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the expectation value of S_i·S_j for a given state.

Wait, another idea: using the fact that for any two spins, S_i + S_j squared is S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i·S_j.

We know that:

<S_i + S_j>^2 = <S_i>^2 + <S_j>^2 + 2 <S_i·S_j>.

But wait, in our case, the state psi is not a product state, so we can't directly compute <S_i + S_j>^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of all S_i in the state has some expectation value.

Wait, let me think about the total spin.

Wait, in the state psi, each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin is... Hmm, actually, the total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3.

In each term of psi, two spins are up, one is down.

So, each term is a combination where two spins contribute +1/2 and one contributes -1/2.

So, the total spin along the z-axis for each term is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) ħ = (1/2) ħ.

So, each term has S_z = 1/2 ħ.

So, each term is part of the S=1/2 multiplet?

Wait, but no, because the total spin is not just in the z-direction. The total spin S^2 is the sum of all spins.

Wait, maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute <S_i·S_j> for the state psi.

Wait, another approach: Since the Hamiltonian is H = A*(sum S_i·S_j), maybe it's useful to notice that this is the same as A*( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - sum S_i^2 ) / 2.

Which is what we had before, H = (A/2) S^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

Therefore, if I can compute <S^2> for the state psi, then I can compute <H> = (A/2) <S^2> - (9A/8) ħ².

So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S^2 for psi, then I can get the expectation value of H.

So, let's compute <S^2> = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>.

We know that each S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ², so sum S_i^2 = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, <S^2> = <9/4 ħ²> + 2 <sum S_i·S_j>.

So, <S^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 <sum S_i·S_j>.

But sum S_i·S_j = (sum S_i·S_j). So, if I can find <sum S_i·S_j>, I can find <S^2>.

But wait, that's circular. Alternatively, the above equation can be rewritten as:

<sum S_i·S_j> = ( <S^2> - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

Therefore, if we have <H> = A * <sum S_i·S_j> = A*( <S^2> - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

But we still don't know <S^2>.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute <S^2> directly.

So, S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, <S^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2 <sum S_i·S_j>.

But that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe we can think about the action of S^2 on the state psi.

Since S^2 is the total spin squared operator, it can take the state to another state with different total spin.

But in our state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, the total spin S is... Let me compute S^2 for each term.

Wait, each term is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Each of these is a state with two spins up and one spin down.

We can compute S^2 for each such state.

Wait, for a given term like |↑↑↓⟩, S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Which would be S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, for the state |↑↑↓⟩, let's compute S^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

First, S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly for S2^2 and S3^2.

So, S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩.

S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, the diagonal terms sum to 9/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, the cross terms: 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Let me compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↑↑↓⟩.

We already computed S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩: as above, let's recall that S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩⟨↓↓| / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no, we had earlier that S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↓| / 2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (|↑⟩⟨↑| / 2) |↓↑↓⟩.

Wait, but |↑↑↓⟩ and |↓↑↓⟩ are orthogonal, so when you
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by \( H = A \cdot (S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \), where \( A \) is a constant and \( S_i \) are the spin operators for each particle. The state \( \psi \) is given as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle + |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle + |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \right) \). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of \( H \), and if so, what the energy is. If not, what is the expectation value of the energy?

First, I need to recall some properties of spin operators. For spin 1/2 particles, the spin operator \( S_i \) is given by \( S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_i \), where \( \sigma_i \) are the Pauli matrices. Also, the dot product of two spin operators \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4} (I \otimes I + 2 S_i \cdot S_j - I) \) but I might be mixing some formulas here.

Wait, actually, I think the more useful identity is that \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) - S_i^2 \) but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, for any two spins, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4} (S_i + S_j)^2 - \frac{1}{4} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) \). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expectation value of \( S_i \cdot S_j \) in the singlet and triplet states. For two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state \( |0,0\rangle \) has \( S_i \cdot S_j = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \) and the triplet states have \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me recall: for two spin 1/2 particles, the total spin \( S = S_1 + S_2 \), so \( S^2 = (S_1 + S_2)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + 2 S_1 \cdot S_2 \). Therefore, \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{S^2 - S_1^2 - S_2^2}{2} \).

Since each \( S_i^2 = \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \), so \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{S^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2}{2} \). Therefore, \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{S^2}{2} - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \).

So if the state is a singlet state (total spin \( S = 0 \)), then \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{0 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2}{2} = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \).

If it's a triplet state (total spin \( S = 1 \)), then \( S^2 = \frac{(\hbar)^2}{4} \times 4 = \hbar^2 \times 1(1 + 1) \). Wait, no. Wait, \( S^2 \) is given by \( \hbar^2 s(s+1) \). So for \( s = 1 \), \( S^2 = \hbar^2 \times 2 \). So \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{2 \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2}{2} = \frac{\frac{4}{2} \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \). So that's correct, triplet states have \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \) and singlet states have \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \).

Therefore, for a state that is a combination of singlet and triplet, the expectation value can be computed accordingly.

Wait, but in our problem, we have three particles, so it's a three-spin system. The Hamiltonian is \( H = A(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \). So \( H \) is a sum of pairwise spin interactions. Therefore, perhaps I can first compute the expectation value of each \( S_i \cdot S_j \) in the given state \( \psi \), and then multiply each by \( A \) and sum them up.

So, let me first analyze the state \( \psi \). It is given as a symmetric combination of three terms, each term having two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, each term has two spins up and one spin down, but in different positions. So each term is a product state with two up spins and one down spin, and the state is symmetric under permutation.

So the state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle + |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle + |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \right) \).

Therefore, it's a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, but since all the permutations are equally weighted, it's not a pure triplet state, but a combination. Let me check the total spin of this state. Wait, if it's a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, maybe it's part of the triplet or singlet in some subspace.

Alternatively, maybe it's a state that is in the subspace of total spin \( S = 1 \) or \( S = 0 \). Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or possibly 0? Wait, no, the total spin can be from 3/2 down to 3/2 - 3*(1/2) but in integer steps. Wait, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2, because 3/2 is the maximum, then it can go down by 1 each time. But the minimum is 3*(1/2) - 3*(1/2) = 0? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the total spin \( S \) for multiple particles is obtained by adding each spin. For three spin 1/2 particles, the maximum total spin is 3/2, and the minimum is |3/2 - 3*(1/2)|, which is 0. So the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, for each spin 1/2, adding two together can give total spin 1 or 0, and then adding a third spin 1/2. So the possible total spins could be 3/2, 1/2, or 1/2 again? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2, 1/2, or 1/2? No, that's not quite. Let's think in terms of addition.

Start with two spin 1/2 particles, which can give total spin 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). Then add a third spin 1/2 to each of these.

If the first two have total spin 1, adding a third spin 1/2: the possible total spins are 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 and |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

If the first two have total spin 0, adding a third spin 1/2: possible total spins are 0 + 1/2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the total spin for three spin 1/2 particles can be 3/2 or 1/2. So there are four possible states for each: for 3/2, there is one state, and for 1/2, there are three states.

Wait, but in our case, the state \( \psi \) is a symmetric state with two up spins and one down spin. So let's see what its total spin is.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total spin squared, \( S^2 \), for the state \( \psi \). If I can compute \( \langle S^2 \rangle \), that might give me the total spin.

So \( S^2 = (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \).

Therefore, \( S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 = \frac{S^2 - S_1^2 - S_2^2 - S_3^2}{2} \).

So, in our case, \( H = A \cdot (S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 ) = A \cdot \left( \frac{S^2 - 3 S_1^2 }{2} \right ) \), because \( S_1^2 = S_2^2 = S_3^2 = \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \).

Wait, no, \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = 3 \times \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \). So \( H = \frac{A}{2} (S^2 - \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 ) \).

Therefore, \( H = \frac{A}{2} S^2 - \frac{9 A}{8} \hbar^2 \). So if I can find \( S^2 \) for the state \( \psi \), I can compute \( H \psi \).

So let me compute \( \langle \psi | S^2 | \psi \rangle \).

But computing \( S^2 \) for an arbitrary three-spin state can be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can compute \( \langle S^2 \rangle \) by expanding \( S^2 \) in terms of products of spins.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each \( S_i \cdot S_j \) expectation value separately.

So, let's compute \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle \), \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_3 \rangle \), and \( \langle S_2 \cdot S_3 \rangle \).

Since the state \( \psi \) is symmetric with respect to permutations, all these three expectation values should be equal.

Therefore, \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle = \langle S_1 \cdot S_3 \rangle = \langle S_2 \cdot S_3 \rangle \).

So, let's compute one of them, say \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle \), and then multiply by 3.

So, \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i,j} \langle \psi | (\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow) | \psi \rangle \times \text{overlap factor} \).

Wait, no. Maybe a better approach is to express \( S_i \) in terms of Pauli matrices, and compute the expectation value in the state \( \psi \).

Since \( S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_i \), then \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \).

Therefore, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} (I \otimes I + 2 \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j ) - \frac{\hbar^2}{4} I \), but that seems complicated.

Wait, actually, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) + \frac{1}{2} S_i \cdot S_j \). Hmm, that might not help.

Alternatively, I know that \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j = I \otimes I + 2 (\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j ) \), but perhaps that's not useful either.

Wait, perhaps using the identity \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j = 2 S_i \cdot S_j / \hbar^2 \). So \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} \frac{\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j}{2} \). Wait, maybe not. Let me get this straight.

For spin-1/2 particles, \( S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_i \). Therefore, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \).

But \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j = 2 S_i \cdot S_j / \hbar^2 \). Therefore, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar}{4} \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute \( \langle \psi | S_i \cdot S_j | \psi \rangle \) directly by expressing \( S_i \cdot S_j \) in terms of the Pauli matrices.

So, for \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \), it's \( \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \). Similarly, \( S_1 \cdot S_3 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 \), and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3 \).

Therefore, \( H = A \cdot \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{4} (\sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 + \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 + \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) \right ) \).

So, the expectation value of \( H \) is \( \frac{A \hbar^2}{4} \times \left( \langle \psi | (\sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 + \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 + \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3) | \psi \rangle \right ) \).

So, now I need to compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 | \psi \rangle \), \( \langle \psi | \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 | \psi \rangle \), and \( \langle \psi | \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3 | \psi \rangle \).

Since the state \( \psi \) is symmetric under permutation, all these three expectation values should be equal. So, I just need to compute one of them, say \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle \), and multiply by 3.

So, let's compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 | \psi \rangle \).

First, note that \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = I \otimes I + \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \). Wait, no, \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = I \otimes I + \sigma_1 \otimes \sigma_2 + \sigma_2 \otimes \sigma_1 \). Wait, that's not right.

Wait, \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = \sigma_1_x \sigma_2_x + \sigma_1_y \sigma_2_y + \sigma_1_z \sigma_2_z \).

So, \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x + \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y + \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \).

Therefore, \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = \langle \psi | (\sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x + \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y + \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z ) | \psi \rangle \).

So, breaking this down, it's equal to \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle + \langle \psi | \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \psi \rangle + \langle \psi | \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \psi \rangle \).

Therefore, I need to compute each of these three expectation values.

Given that the state \( \psi \) is a symmetric combination of three product states with two up spins and one down spin, perhaps I can compute these expectation values by considering the action of each Pauli matrix on the state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for a product state, \( \sigma_i \otimes \sigma_j \) acts on each component of the state, and then I can compute the expectation value as the sum over the bra and ket states.

Alternatively, since the state \( \psi \) is a symmetric combination of three product states, it might be easier to write \( | \psi \rangle \) in terms of computational basis states and then compute the expectation value.

So, let's write \( | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle + | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle + | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \right ) \).

So, in terms of basis states, it's a linear combination of three basis vectors.

Now, let me compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \).

First, note that \( \sigma_x | \uparrow \rangle = | \downarrow \rangle \) and \( \sigma_x | \downarrow \rangle = | \uparrow \rangle \).

So, \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \).

Similarly, \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

And \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

Therefore, \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle + | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle + | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \right ) \).

Now, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{3} \left( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | + \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | + \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \right ) \left( | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle + | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle + | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \right ) \).

So, this becomes \( \frac{1}{3} \) times the number of overlapping terms between the two vectors.

Looking at the components:

First, \( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | \) has non-zero inner product only with itself, but in the sum, it's being dotted with \( | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \), which is different because the first spin is down instead of up, so no overlap.

Similarly, \( \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \) is dotted with \( | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \)? No, because the first spin is down and the third spin is down, but the second spin is up. The bra is \( | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \), which is different from \( | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \) because the first spin is different. So no overlap here.

Similarly, \( \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \) is dotted with \( | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \). The second spin is down in the ket, but up in the bra, so no overlap.

Wait, so none of the terms overlap? So the inner product is zero. Is that the case?

Wait, actually, wait. Let me think carefully.

Wait, actually, the first term in the ket is \( | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \). The first term in the bra is \( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | \). So, comparing:

Bra: up, up, down.

Ket: down, down, up.

No overlap because the first spin in the ket is down, whereas the bra has up.

Second term in the ket: \( | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

Bra: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \). Comparing:

Bra: up, down, up.

Ket: down, up, down.

Not overlapping because the first spin is down vs up, and the third spin is down vs up.

Third term in the ket: \( | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

Bra: \( \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \).

Comparing:

Bra: down, up, up.

Ket: up, down, down.

No, the first spin is different (down vs up), so no overlap.

Therefore, all the inner products are zero, so \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0 \).

Similarly, I think \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = 0 \) as well. Because \( \sigma_y \) is an imaginary unit times something, but maybe let's check.

Wait, \( \sigma_y | \uparrow \rangle = i | \downarrow \rangle \), and \( \sigma_y | \downarrow \rangle = -i | \uparrow \rangle \).

So, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = (i | \downarrow_1 \rangle ) \otimes (i | \downarrow_2 \rangle ) = (-1) | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \).

Wait, \( i \times i = -1 \). So, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = (-1) | \downarrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \).

Similarly, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = (-1) | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

And \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = (-1) | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

Therefore, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = (-1) | \psi \rangle \).

Thus, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = (-1) \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (-1)(1) = -1 \).

Wait, that's different. So, unlike \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x \), the action of \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \) on \( | \psi \rangle \) gives \( -| \psi \rangle \), so the expectation value is -1.

Wait, so \( \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle = -1 \).

Wait, but in the Hamiltonian, \( H = A (S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 ) = A \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 + \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 + \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3 ) \).

So, for \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \), I found that \( \langle \psi | \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 | \psi \rangle = 0 + 0 + (-1) \) ? Wait, no.

Wait, no, actually, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \) gives -1, but \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x + \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y + \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \).

So, \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = \langle \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x \rangle + \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle + \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle = 0 + (-1) + \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle \).

Wait, so I need to compute \( \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle \).

So, \( \sigma_z | \uparrow \rangle = | \uparrow \rangle \), \( \sigma_z | \downarrow \rangle = - | \downarrow \rangle \).

Therefore, \( \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = (1)(1) | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \).

Similarly, \( \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = (1)(-1) | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = - | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \).

And \( \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = (-1)(1) | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle = - | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \).

Therefore, \( \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} ( | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle - | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle - | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) \).

Thus, \( \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{3} \left( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | + \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | + \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \right ) \left( | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle - | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle - | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \right ) \).

Let's compute this term by term.

First term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | \cdot | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = 1 \).
Second term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | \cdot (- | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = 0 \) (different spins in second position).
Third term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 | \cdot (- | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = 0 \) (different spins in first position).

Fourth term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = 0 \).
Fifth term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot (- | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = -1 \) (all spins match).
Sixth term: \( \langle \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot (- | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = 0 \).

Seventh term: \( \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle = 0 \).
Eighth term: \( \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot (- | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = 0 \).
Ninth term: \( \langle \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 | \cdot (- | \downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle ) = -1 \).

So, summing all these terms:

First term: 1
Second term: 0
Third term: 0
Fourth term: 0
Fifth term: -1
Sixth term: 0
Seventh term: 0
Eighth term: 0
Ninth term: -1

Total sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Therefore, \( \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle = \frac{1}{3} (-1) = -1/3 \).

Putting it all together:

\( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = \langle \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x \rangle + \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle + \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle = 0 + (-1) + (-1/3) = -4/3 \).

Wait, hold on: 0 -1 -1/3 = -4/3. So, \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = -4/3 \).

But earlier, I thought that for triplet states \( \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = 1 \), but here, it's actually -4/3. Maybe because the state is not a triplet state but a different state.

Wait, but let me verify. If \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = -4/3 \), then \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \times (-4/3) = -\hbar^2 / 3 \).

But for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state has \( \langle S_1 \cdot S_2 \rangle = -3/4 \hbar^2 \), while the triplet states have \( 1/4 \hbar^2 \). So, in this three-spin system, the state has a different value.

But maybe that's because it's a three-spin system.

Wait, so for three spins, the pairwise interactions are different. So, perhaps in this three-spin system, the pairwise expectation is different from the two-spin case.

So, coming back, \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle = -4/3 \).

Similarly, as the state is symmetric, \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 \rangle = \langle \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3 \rangle = -4/3 \).

Therefore, the total \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 + \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_3 + \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3 \rangle = (-4/3) \times 3 = -4 \).

Therefore, \( \langle H \rangle = \frac{A \hbar^2}{4} \times (-4) = -A \hbar^2 \).

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the answer given in the question. Wait, in the problem statement, the correct answer is that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue \( 2/3 A \hbar^2 \).

So, either I have a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps the state is an eigenstate of a different operator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing \( \langle \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \rangle \). Let me double-check my steps.

So, first, I found that \( \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0 \), so \( \langle \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x \rangle = 0 \).

Then, \( \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -| \psi \rangle \), so \( \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle = -1 \).

Then, \( \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z | \psi \rangle \) gave me an expectation value of
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, I have to find its energy. If not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall that the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j is equal to (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2). So S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2 - S_ij^2/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2). Since (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2S_i·S_j, so rearranging gives S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2)/2. But since (S_i + S_j)^2 is S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2S_i·S_j, so S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 - 2S_i·S_j)/2? Wait, that can't be. Maybe I should compute S_i·S_j differently.

Wait, another approach: for spin 1/2 particles, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2)/2. Let me test this formula. If I compute S_i·S_j, when the two spins are in a singlet state (total spin 0), S_ij^2 = 0, so S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2 = (3/4 + 3/4)ħ^2 = (3/2)ħ^2. But actually, in a singlet state, S_i·S_j = - (ħ^2)/4. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.

Wait, let's think about the relation: S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall that (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2S_i·S_j. So, solving for S_i·S_j: S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

But since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4 ħ^2) - (3/4 ħ^2) ] / 2. So that's [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2.

But S_i + S_j can take values either S=1 or S=0. If S=1, then (S_i + S_j)^2 = S(S+1)ħ^2 = 2ħ^2. If S=0, then (S_i + S_j)^2 = 0.

So S_i·S_j can take two values: When S=1, S_i·S_j = (2ħ^2 - 3/2 ħ^2)/2 = (1/2 ħ^2)/2 = (1/4)ħ^2. When S=0, S_i·S_j = (0 - 3/2 ħ^2)/2 = (-3/4)ħ^2.

So, S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ] ħ^2 / 2 = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ] ħ^2 / 2.

Yes, that makes sense. So S_i·S_j = ( (S_total)^2 - 3/2 ) ħ^2 / 2.

In terms of eigenvalue, when S=1, (S_total)^2 = 1*(1+1) ħ^2 = 2ħ^2, so S_i·S_j = (2 - 3/2) ħ^2 / 2 = (1/2) ħ^2 / 2 = (1/4) ħ^2.

When S=0, (S_total)^2 = 0, so S_i·S_j = (0 - 3/2) ħ^2 / 2 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ^2.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to write H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Alternatively, note that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ).

So, let me compute that:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3: it's (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Given that each S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, so sum S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2.

Thus, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2 ) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2).

Now, since S_total is the total spin operator, it has eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ^2, where S is the total spin quantum number, which can be 3/2 (for triplet states) or 1/2 (for singlet states). Wait, three spin 1/2 particles: the possible total spins are 3/2 (if all three are up) or 1/2.

But in our state psi, let's see: each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. So, each term is a state with S_z = +1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = +1/2.

Therefore, the state is symmetric under permutation of the spins, but let's check: psi is symmetric? Let's see.

Each term is up up down, up down up, down up up. These are all permutations of each other. So the state is symmetric under permutation, meaning it's in the symmetric subspace. The symmetric subspace for three spin-1/2 particles is the space of symmetric states.

What's the dimension of the symmetric subspace? For three spin-1/2 particles, the total Hilbert space is 2^3 = 8 dimensional. The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional (since the total symmetric states are (1 + 3 choose 1) = 4, I think? Wait, no, wait. The symmetric subspace is the set of states invariant under permutation of particles. The dimension can be found by considering the irreducible representations of the permutation group S3. The spin states decompose into representations of S3. Since each spin-1/2 particle is a 2-dimensional representation, the tensor product is (2)^3 = 8. The symmetric subspace is the sum of the trivial representation (dimension 1) and the symmetric 3-dimensional representation (since S3 has representations of dimensions 1 and 3). Therefore, the symmetric subspace is 1 + 3 = 4 dimensions.

Similarly, the antisymmetric subspace is 4 dimensions.

In our case, the state psi is symmetric, so it lies in the symmetric subspace of dimension 4. But the state psi is given as a combination of 3 terms, so it's a 3-dimensional subspace. So maybe it's part of the symmetric subspace.

But returning to H: since H is a function of S_total^2, which commutes with S_total^2, so the eigenstates of H are eigenstates of S_total^2. Therefore, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it is an eigenstate of H. So, we need to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

So let's compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So it's similar to what I had before.

But perhaps more useful is that S_total^2 |psi> = S(S+1)ħ^2 |psi> if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

So, suppose |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ^2. Then H|psi> = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi> = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2 ) |psi> = A*( (S(S+1)ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 ) |psi> = (A/2)(S(S+1) - 9/4) ħ^2 |psi>.

Therefore, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue as above.

So, first, I need to check if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

How to compute S_total^2 |psi>? Let's think about how to compute this. S_total^2 is the sum of S_i^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j. So, acting on |psi>, we can write it as:

S_total^2 |psi> = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) |psi> + 2(S1·S2 |psi> + S1·S3 |psi> + S2·S3 |psi>).

But S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are all (3/4) ħ^2, so (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)|psi> = (9/4 ħ^2) |psi>.

Thus, S_total^2 |psi> = (9/4 ħ^2)|psi> + 2(S1·S2 |psi> + S1·S3 |psi> + S2·S3 |psi>).

So, if I can compute S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 acting on |psi>, then I can find S_total^2 |psi>.

Therefore, perhaps I can compute each term S_i·S_j |psi> and see if it's proportional to |psi>.

Let me define each operator S_i·S_j.

Given that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2).

Wait, but maybe it's better to write it as S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - (S_i + S_j)^2). So, perhaps using this.

Alternatively, since I know that for spin-1/2 particles, (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i·S_j.

Thus, S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

So, S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4 ħ^2) - (3/4 ħ^2) ) / 2 = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ) / 2.

Therefore, S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2) ħ^2 ] / 2.

So, to compute S_i·S_j |psi>, perhaps it's easier if I can find the action of (S_i + S_j)^2 on |psi>.

Let me consider S1·S2 |psi> = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - (3/2) ħ^2 ] / 2 |psi>.

Similarly for the others.

First, let me compute (S1 + S2)^2 |psi>.

Note that each term in |psi> is a product state of three spins, e.g., up up down.

But S1 + S2 acts on the first two spins. Let me think about how to compute (S1 + S2)^2 acting on each term.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the state |psi> is symmetric in the first two spins? Let me check.

Wait, |psi> is a symmetric combination of the three different states where two are up and one is down.

Each term is a product state where two spins are up, and one is down, but each term is unique under permutation.

Wait, actually, perhaps the state |psi> is an eigenstate of the total spin S_z. Let me check.

Each term in |psi> has S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = +1/2. So, |psi> is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +1/2.

Moreover, since it's symmetric under permutation, it's also an eigenstate of S_total^x and S_total^y? Maybe not necessarily, but it might be in a particular spin state.

Wait, maybe I can compute the action of S1 + S2 on each term.

Let me think about the term up up down.

Let me denote each spin as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, the first term is |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute (S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = S1 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But S1 and S2 are spin operators for the first and second particles.

Note that S1 acts on the first spin, S2 on the second spin, and S3 on the third.

So, S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( |↓⟩ ) for the first spin, times the state of the second and third spins. Wait, no. Spin operators act on their respective particles.

Wait, the spin operator S1 for the first particle is (ħ/2) σ1, where σ1 are the Pauli matrices.

So, S1 |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, and S2 |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩.

So, S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩ for the first spin, leaving the second and third spins as |↑↓⟩. So, S1 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↓↓⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↑↓↓⟩.

Similarly, we can compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)(S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩.

But this seems cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Since S1^2 and S2^2 both act as (3/4)ħ^2 on their respective spins, so S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩, same for S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/2 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ) / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

So, to compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩, we have to find (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩, which is (S1 + S2)(S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ directly.

Wait, let's recall that (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2 + 2 S1·S2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (3/2 ħ^2 + 2 S1·S2)|↑↑↓⟩.

But earlier, I have that (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Hmm, but I need to compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ to get S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, note that (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But maybe instead of trying to compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩, I can compute the expectation value or see if it's a multiple of |↑↑↓⟩.

Alternatively, let's consider that (S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 |↑↑↓⟩) + (S2 |↑↑↓⟩) = (ħ/2)|↓↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↑↓↓⟩.

So, (S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ ).

Then, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)( ħ/2 ( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ ) ).

So, we have to apply (S1 + S2) to each of these states.

Let's compute:

First term: (S1 + S2) |↓↑↓⟩.

S1 |↓↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩,

S2 |↓↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩.

So, (S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, (S1 + S2) |↑↓↓⟩ = S1 |↑↓↓⟩ + S2 |↑↓↓⟩.

Compute S1 |↑↓↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩,

S2 |↑↓↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, (S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)( ħ/2 ( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ ) ) = (ħ/2)[ (S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ + (S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩ ].

Which is (ħ/2)[ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩)/2 + (|↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩)/2 ].

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is (S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩)/2 ħ.

Similarly, (S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩ = (|↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩)/2 ħ.

So, adding these two:

(S1 + S2)( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ ) = ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩ ) * (ħ/2).

Which is (2|↑↑↓⟩ + 2|↓↓↓⟩) * (ħ/2) = ( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ ) * ħ.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ ) * ħ.

Wait, no, wait: (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)(S1 + S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = ( ħ/2 (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩) ) * ħ.

Wait, no, hold on:

Wait, (S1 + S2)|↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ )

Then, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2) * ( ħ/2 (|↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩) )

Which is (S1 + S2)(ħ/2 |↓↑↓⟩ + ħ/2 |↑↓↓⟩ )

Which equals (ħ/2)(S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)(S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩.

Which is (ħ/2)[ (S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ + (S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩ ]

Which is (ħ/2)[ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩)/2 + (|↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩)/2 ]

Which is (ħ/2)[ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩ ) / 2 ]

Wait, that seems complex.

Wait, let me compute each term:

(S1 + S2)|↓↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, (S1 + S2)|↑↓↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↓⟩ ) = (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ/2)|↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, that's ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 )|↑↑↓⟩ + ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 )|↓↓↓⟩ = ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)(S1 + S2)|↑↑↓⟩ = ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩.

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ħ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩).

Similarly, we can compute (S1 + S3)^2 |up1 down2 up3⟩ and (S2 + S3)^2 |down1 up2 up3⟩.

But this seems quite involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that the action of S_total^2 on |psi> can be found by considering the action on each term.

Given that |psi> is a sum of three terms, each with two spins up and one spin down.

Let me denote the three terms as:

T1 = |↑↑↓⟩,

T2 = |↑↓↑⟩,

T3 = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, |psi> = (T1 + T2 + T3)/sqrt(3).

Compute S_total^2 |psi>:

S_total^2 |psi> = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |psi>.

As before, S_total^2 |psi> = (9/4 ħ^2)|psi> + 2(S1·S2 |psi> + S1·S3 |psi> + S2·S3 |psi>).

So, if I can compute each of these terms S1·S2 |psi>, etc., and see if they are proportional to |psi>, then we can have S_total^2 |psi> proportional to |psi>.

Alternatively, perhaps S1·S2 |psi> is proportional to |psi>.

Wait, let's compute S1·S2 |psi>.

But S1·S2 |psi> = S1·S2 (T1 + T2 + T3)/sqrt(3).

So, S1·S2 T1: S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

From earlier, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ) / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But we just computed (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ħ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩).

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ ħ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↓⟩) - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, actually, hold on.

Wait, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 * |↑↑↓⟩.

So, substituting (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩,

Then, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ ( ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩ ) - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 * |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but that seems problematic because we have a term that is an operator acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 is an operator, not a scalar.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 is an operator, so S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ is an operator acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

So, in fact, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ is ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩.

Thus, [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ ( ħ |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ |↓↓↓⟩ ) - (3/2 ħ^2 ) ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but this is not correct, because (S1 + S2)^2 is an operator, so when we write [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2, it's an operator, so we cannot separate the action on |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps I should compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ directly.

Alternatively, think about the action of S1·S2 on the product states.

Recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)( S1^2 + S2^2 - S12^2 ).

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ - S12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ ).

But S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩,

Similarly, S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩,

And S12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S_total12)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, S12 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2. So, S12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ is (0)(0 + 1) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩? No, wait, S12^2 is the square of the total spin for particles 1 and 2.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1 or 0.

In |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins are both up, so S12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1)(1 + 1) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2 - 2 ħ^2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute this: (1/2)( 3/4 + 3/4 - 2 ) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( 1.5 - 2 ) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( -0.5 ) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, we can compute S1·S2 T2 and S1·S2 T3.

Compute S1·S2 T2: T2 = |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)( S1^2 + S2^2 - S12^2 ) |↑↓↑⟩.

S1^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = 3/4 ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩,

S2^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = 3/4 ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩,

S12^2 |↑↓↑⟩: In |↑↓↑⟩, the first and second spins are |↑↓⟩, so the total spin S12 is (0 or 1).

Wait, in |↑↓⟩, the total spin is S=1/2, so S12^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = ( (S12(S12 +1) ) ħ^2 ) |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, no, S12^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = ( (S12)(S12 +1) ħ^2 ) |↑↓↑⟩.

But in |↑↓↑⟩, the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, which is a spin 1/2 state, so S12^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (3/4) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Thus, S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 + 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (3/8) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, let me compute again:

S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)( S1^2 + S2^2 - S12^2 ) |↑↓↑⟩.

= (1/2)( 3/4 + 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩

= (1/2)( 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩

= (3/8) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, compute S1·S2 T3: T3 = |↓↑↑⟩.

S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 + 3/4 - S12^2 ) |↓↑↑⟩.

In |↓↑↑⟩, the first two spins are |↓↑⟩, which is a spin 1/2 state, so S12^2 |↓↑↑⟩ = 3/4 ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩.

Thus, S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 + 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (1/2)( 3/4 ) ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩ = 3/8 ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1·S2 |psi> = S1·S2 (T1 + T2 + T3)/sqrt(3) = [ ( (-1/4) ħ^2 T1 ) + (3/8 ħ^2 T2 ) + (3/8 ħ^2 T3 ) ] / sqrt(3).

So, factor out ħ^2 / sqrt(3):

= ( ħ^2 / sqrt(3) ) [ (-1/4) T1 + (3/8) T2 + (3/8) T3 ].

Let me compute the coefficients:

-1/4 = -2/8,

3/8 and 3/8.

Thus, the
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and S1, S2, S3 are the spin operators for each particle. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3 times [up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3]. 

First, I should recall that spin operators S_i for a spin-1/2 particle have the form S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So each S_i is proportional to the Pauli matrices. 

The Hamiltonian is a sum of dot products of the spins, which can be written as S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)² - (S1² + S2²). Similarly for the other terms. But maybe I can think about the total spin squared operator, which is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding that, we get S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). 

So, from this, I can solve for the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is equal to (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. 

Given that each S_i² for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ²/4) * I, since S_i² = (ħ²/4)(I) for each i. So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(ħ²/4)*I. 

Therefore, S_total² = 3*(ħ²/4)*I + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). 

So, rearranging, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - 3*(ħ²/4)*I)/2. 

Plugging this back into the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*[ (S_total² - 3*(ħ²/4)*I)/2 ].

So, H = (A/2)*(S_total² - 3*(ħ²/4)*I).

Now, the eigenfunctions of S_total² are the states with definite total spin S. Since we have three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. 

The eigenvalues of S_total² are ħ² S(S+1). So, if the state ψ is an eigenstate of S_total², then it will be an eigenstate of H. 

I need to check whether ψ is an eigenstate of S_total². 

Let me look at the state ψ. It is given as a symmetric combination of states with two up spins and one down spin. Each term in the sum has two spins up and one spin down. So, this suggests that the total spin S might be 1/2 because for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (total spin 0) is antisymmetric, and the triplet states (total spin 1) are symmetric. But wait, two up and one down... Hmm.

Wait, let me think. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The singlet (total spin 0) is not possible with three spin-1/2 particles because the combination is antisymmetric, but three spin-1/2 would need even numbers of down spins to be antisymmetric, right? Wait, maybe not. Let me double-check.

The total spin state for three particles can be calculated using the coupling of two spins first. For example, consider the first two spins coupling to spin 1 or spin 0, and then coupling that to the third spin. 

But perhaps an easier way is to think about the possible total spins. Let me compute the total spin squared operator on the state ψ and see if it gives a multiple of the identity operator or not.

So, let me write S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². 

Expanding that: S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already know that S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(ħ²/4)*I, as each is (ħ²/4)*I.

So, S_total² = 3*(ħ²/4)*I + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But we also have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (H / A) - (3*(ħ²/4)*I)/2.

Wait, no, earlier we had H = (A/2)*(S_total² - 3*(ħ²/4)*I). So, H = (A/2) S_total² - (3*A/8)ħ² I.

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (2/(A)) H + (3/(4)ħ² I).

But maybe that's complicating things. Instead, going back, perhaps I can compute S_total² acting on ψ.

But computing S_total² acting on ψ is going to be a bit involved because it's the sum of spin operators. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since the state ψ has two spins up and one spin down, perhaps I can compute its total spin. Let me count the number of spins in the up and down directions.

Each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down. So when I compute S_total², which is (S1 + S2 + S3)², I need to find the expectation value of this operator on ψ.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the total spin squared operator for ψ. Since ψ is symmetric in the spins, maybe it's an eigenstate.

Alternatively, let's recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2.

But I need to see whether ψ is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of spins. Since ψ is symmetric, perhaps it's part of a higher total spin state.

Wait, ψ is symmetric in the sense that it's a sum of all possible states with two spins up and one spin down. So, it's symmetric under permutation of the spins.

Wait, actually, each term in ψ is a product of two up spins and one down spin, and each term is a different particle being down. So, permuting the spins would permute the terms in the sum, and since all terms are similar, ψ is symmetric under permutation of the spins.

Therefore, ψ is symmetric under the exchange of any two particles. Therefore, it's a symmetric state. 

Now, what are the symmetric states for three spin-1/2 particles? The triplet states with total spin S=1 would be symmetric, and the singlet state with S=0 is antisymmetric. 

But wait, for three particles, the total spin can be 1/2 or 3/2. The singlet (S=0) isn't possible for three spin-1/2 particles because you need an even number of down spins for the antisymmetric combination, but since we're dealing with three particles, perhaps. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the singlet state is a state where the total spin is zero. For three spin-1/2 particles, is it possible? 

I think yes, because you can have a state where all three spins are opposite, but that's a singlet state. Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is a state with all three spins in a state that is symmetric under exchange, but with total spin zero. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how spin states work for multiple particles. For two particles, singlet is antisymmetric, triplet is symmetric. For three particles, it's a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the state ψ is a member of a triplet state where S=1. Because each term in ψ has two up spins and one down spin, which is similar to the structure of the triplet states for two spins, but extended to three.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are either S=1/2 or S=3/2.

The S=3/2 state is the completely symmetric state, right? Because all permutations are symmetric.

But the state ψ is also symmetric, so it could be part of the S=3/2 multiplet. Alternatively, if it's not part of that, maybe it's in the S=1/2 multiplet. Hmm.

Wait, let me compute the total spin squared operator S_total² on ψ and see what it gives.

First, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

As we established before, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3ħ²/4 * I.

So, S_total² = 3ħ²/4 I + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But our Hamiltonian H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = H / A.

So, plugging back in, S_total² = 3ħ²/4 I + 2*(H / A).

Therefore, S_total² = 2*(H / A) + 3ħ²/4 I.

Hmm, but we can also express S_total² as:

S_total² = ħ² S(S+1) I,

where S is the total spin. Therefore, for ψ to be an eigenstate of S_total², it must be an eigenstate of H as well because H is a linear combination of S1·S2, etc., which is related to S_total².

So, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total², then it's an eigenstate of H.

But let's try to compute S_total² ψ and see if it's a multiple of ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H, which is the same as the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

So, E = ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ = A ⟨ψ|S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3|ψ⟩.

So, I can compute the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩, sum them, multiply by A, and that's the expectation value of H.

Now, let's compute each of these expectation values.

First, for a singlet or triplet state of two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 is known.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S_total² = 0, so S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2 = (0 - (3/4 ħ²)I - (3/4 ħ²)I)/2 = (- 3/2 ħ² /4 ) I / 2? Wait, perhaps better to think about it in terms of eigenvalues.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S_total = 0, so S_total² = 0, and S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2 = (0 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (- 3/2 ħ²)/2 = -3/4 ħ².

Similarly, for the triplet state, S_total = 1, so S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2 = (2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 3/2)/2 ħ² = (1/2)/2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

But wait, 2ħ² comes from S_total² = ħ² S(S+1) = ħ²*2 for S=1, so 2 ħ².

So, S1·S2 for triplet is (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ²? Wait, perhaps I need to re-express.

Wait, let's clarify. For two spin-1/2 particles:

S_total² = (S1 + S2)² = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

Since S1² = (3/4) ħ² I and same for S2², so S1·S2 = (S_total² - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) I)/2.

So, if the state is a singlet (S_total=0), S1·S2 = (0 - 3/2 ħ² I)/2 = -3/4 ħ².

If the state is a triplet (S_total=1), S1·S2 = (2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = (0.5 ħ²)/2 = 1/4 ħ².

So, yes, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is -3/4 ħ² for singlet and 1/4 ħ² for triplet.

Now, in our problem, the state ψ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. Let's see if it's a singlet or triplet or something else for two spins.

Wait, actually, in our case, we have three spins, so S1·S2 is the dot product of two spin operators. The expectation value of S1·S2 in the state ψ can be calculated as follows.

First, since the state ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two spins, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ is equal for all pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). So, if I compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩, it will be equal to ⟨ψ|S1·S3|ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ|S2·S3|ψ⟩. So, the expectation value of H will be 3 times the expectation value of any one of these terms.

So, let me compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩.

First, note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1² + S2²)/2.

Wait, but that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, since S1·S2 is a scalar operator, maybe I can write it in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Recall that S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i, so S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2).

Similarly, σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

Therefore, S1·S2 can be written as (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2).

So, to compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩, I can compute (ħ²/4)⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩.

Now, ψ is given as 1/√3 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, ψ is a symmetric combination of the three states where two spins are up and one is down. 

Let me denote each term as |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩, where |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, ψ = (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/√3.

So, when computing ⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩, it's equivalent to [1/3](⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|) σ1·σ2 (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩).

So, I need to compute this expectation value.

But σ1·σ2 is a product of Pauli matrices acting on particles 1 and 2.

So, I can write σ1·σ2 = σ1_x ⊗ I ⊗ I * σ2_x + σ2_y ⊗ I ⊗ I * σ2_y + σ2_z ⊗ I ⊗ I * σ1_z.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, σ1·σ2 is the sum over i: σi ⊗ σi acting on particles 1 and 2.

Wait, more correctly, σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

So, when I write σ1·σ2 acting on |a⟩, it's equivalent to acting σ1_x on particle 1, σ2_x on particle 2, etc.

So, let's compute σ1·σ2 |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩.

First, |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

Applying σ1·σ2 to |a⟩:

σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (σ1_x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_x |↑⟩ ) + (σ1_y |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_y |↑⟩ ) + (σ1_z |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_z |↑⟩ ).

Compute each term:

σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so first term is |↓↓↓⟩.

σ1_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, σ2_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, so second term is (i)(i) |↓↓↓⟩ = (-1)|↓↓↓⟩.

σ1_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, so third term is |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, compute σ1·σ2 |b⟩, where |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (σ1_x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_x |↓⟩ ) + (σ1_y |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_y |↓⟩ ) + (σ1_z |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2_z |↓⟩ ).

Compute each term:

σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so first term is |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, σ2_y |↓⟩ = -i |↑⟩, so second term is (i)(-i) |↓↑↑⟩ = (1)|↓↑↑⟩.

σ1_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2_z |↓⟩ = |↓⟩, so third term is |↑↓↑⟩.

Thus, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, actually, hold on. Let's see:

First term: |↓↑↑⟩.

Second term: (i)(-i) |↓↑↑⟩ = ( -i^2 ) |↓↑↑⟩ = ( -(-1) ) |↓↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Third term: |↑↓↑⟩.

So, altogether, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, but |↑↓↑⟩ is different from |↓↑↑⟩. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write σ1·σ2 |b⟩ and see.

Wait, actually, let's do each term:

First term: σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So, first term is |↓⟩ |↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩, but in the context of |↑↓↑⟩, so it's |↓↑↑⟩.

Second term: σ1_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩, σ2_y |↓⟩ = -i |↑⟩. So, the second term is (i)(-i) |↓↑⟩ = (1) |↓↑⟩, which as a state is |↓↑↑⟩.

Third term: σ1_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2_z |↓⟩ = |↓⟩. So, third term is |↑↓↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ = (1 + 1)|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me note the states:

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩

|b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩

|c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩

So, σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ is not correct.

Wait, no, actually, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ is a combination of |↓↑↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, and |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, no, the first term is |↓↑↑⟩, the second term is |↓↑↑⟩, and the third term is |↑↓↑⟩. So, altogether, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, compute σ1·σ2 |c⟩.

|c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (σ1_x |↓⟩ ⊗ σ2_x |↑⟩ ) + (σ1_y |↓⟩ ⊗ σ2_y |↑⟩ ) + (σ1_z |↓⟩ ⊗ σ2_z |↑⟩ ).

Compute each term:

σ1_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩. So, first term is |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1_y |↓⟩ = -i |↑⟩, σ2_y |↑⟩ = i |↓⟩. So, second term is (-i)(i)|↑↓⟩ = (-i^2)|↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩, which as a state is |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1_z |↓⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩. So, third term is |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |c⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ = 2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩.

So, in summary:

σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩

σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩

σ1·σ2 |c⟩ = 2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩

So, now, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩ is equal to [1/3](⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|) σ1·σ2 (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩).

Which is [1/3]*(⟨a|σ1·σ2|a⟩ + ⟨a|σ1·σ2|b⟩ + ⟨a|σ1·σ2|c⟩ + ⟨b|σ1·σ2|a⟩ + ⟨b|σ1·σ2|b⟩ + ⟨b|σ1·σ2|c⟩ + ⟨c|σ1·σ2|a⟩ + ⟨c|σ1·σ2|b⟩ + ⟨c|σ1·σ2|c⟩).

Compute each term:

1. ⟨a|σ1·σ2|a⟩: This is ⟨↑↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Looking at σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨a|σ1·σ2|a⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (|↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩) = 0 - 1 = -1.

2. ⟨a|σ1·σ2|b⟩: ⟨↑↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩.

From earlier, σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

So, ⟨a|σ1·σ2|b⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ) = 0 + 0 = 0.

Similarly, ⟨a|σ1·σ2|c⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |c⟩ = 2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨a|σ1·σ2|c⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = 0 + 0 = 0.

3. ⟨b|σ1·σ2|a⟩: ⟨↑↓↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Looking at σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨b|σ1·σ2|a⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (|↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩ ) = 0 - 0 = 0.

4. ⟨b|σ1·σ2|b⟩: ⟨↑↓↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

So, ⟨b|σ1·σ2|b⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ) = ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩.

Compute each:

⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0 because different states.

⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 1 because same state.

So, total is 1.

5. ⟨b|σ1·σ2|c⟩: ⟨↑↓↑| σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |c⟩ = 2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨b|σ1·σ2|c⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = 2*⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 2*1 + 0 = 2.

6. ⟨c|σ1·σ2|a⟩: ⟨↓↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨c|σ1·σ2|a⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| (|↓↓↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩ ) = 0 - 0 = 0.

7. ⟨c|σ1·σ2|b⟩: ⟨↓↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↓↑⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |b⟩ = 2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩.

So, ⟨c|σ1·σ2|b⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| (2|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ) = 2*⟨↓↑↑|↓↑↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 2*1 + 0 = 2.

8. ⟨c|σ1·σ2|c⟩: ⟨↓↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↓↑↑⟩.

From σ1·σ2 |c⟩ = 2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨c|σ1·σ2|c⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| (2|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = 2*⟨↓↑↑|↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, compiling all terms:

1. -1

2. 0

3. 0

4. 1

5. 2

6. 0

7. 2

8. 1

9. 1

So total expectation value:

[1/3]*( -1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 ) = [1/3]*( (-1) + (1+2+2+1+1) ) = [1/3]*( (-1) + 7 ) = [1/3]*(6) = 2.

So, ⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩ = 2.

But remember that σ1·σ2 is equal to (2/ħ²) S1·S2 because S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So, σ1·σ2 = (2/ħ²)(2 S1·S2)? Wait, no.

Wait, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2), so σ1·σ2 = (4/ħ²)(S1·S2).

Therefore, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = (4/ħ²) ⟨S1·S2⟩.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4) ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2) = ħ²/2.

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = ħ²/2 each.

Therefore, the expectation value of H is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩ ) = A*(3*(ħ²/2)) = (3A ħ²)/2.

Wait, but this contradicts the given correct answer of 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, let me double-check the computation of ⟨ψ|σ1·σ2|ψ⟩.

Earlier, I found that the sum of the terms was 6, so 6*(1/3) = 2. So, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = 2.

But wait, let's think about the units.

S1·S2 is in units of ħ², and σ1·σ2 is dimensionless because σ matrices are dimensionless (they are like spin operators, which have units of 1/2). So, S1·S2 is in units of ħ².

So, σ1·σ2 is in units of ħ² as well? Wait, no.

Wait, S_i is (ħ/2) σ_i, so S_i has units of ħ. So, S1·S2 has units of (ħ)^2.

Similarly, σ1·σ2 is (dimensionless) * (dimensionless) = dimensionless.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2), so σ1·σ2 = 4(S1·S2)/ħ².

Therefore, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = 4⟨S1·S2⟩ / ħ².

So, if I have ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = 2, then ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (2 ħ²)/4 = ħ²/2.

So that's correct.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ² / 2.

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ħ² /2 and ⟨S2·S3⟩ = ħ² /2.

Therefore, the expectation value of H is A*( ħ² / 2 + ħ² / 2 + ħ² / 2 ) = A*( 3ħ² / 2 ).

But the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ².

Hmm, so clearly, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that all three expectation values ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, ⟨S2·S3⟩ are equal is not correct.

Wait, the state ψ is symmetric under exchange of particles, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩, so their sum should be 3 times one of them. So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in computing ⟨σ1·σ2⟩.

Wait, let me recast the problem. Let me consider the state ψ as (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

Now, ψ is a state which is a member of the triplet with total spin S=1/2.

Wait, no, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 1/2 and 3/2.

Wait, actually, wait, three spin-1/2 particles can form either a spin singlet (S=0) or spin states with S=1 and S=3/2.

But wait, no, the singlet state for three particles is S=0, which is totally antisymmetric.

But in our case, ψ is symmetric. So, it can't be S=0.

Wait, maybe it's part of the symmetric S=1 or S=3/2 multiplets.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states would have S=3/2 or S=1.

The state ψ is symmetric, so it can be part of either.

Wait, but S=1 is a triplet state with three states, each with two spins up and one down.

Yes, that's consistent with the structure of ψ.

Thus, ψ is part of the triplet with S=1, so the total spin squared S_total² = ħ² * (1)(1+1) I = 2 ħ² I.

Therefore, S_total² ψ = 2 ħ² ψ.

So, from earlier, H = (A/2)(S_total² - 3ħ²/4 I).

So, plugging in S_total² = 2 ħ² I,

H ψ = (A/2)(2 ħ² I - 3ħ²/4 I) ψ = (A/2)(5 ħ² /4 I) ψ = (5 A ħ² /8) ψ.

But that contradicts the given correct answer of (2/3) A ħ².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a system of three spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian given by \( H = A \left( S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 \right) \), where \( A \) is a constant. The state \( \psi \) is provided as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle + |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle + |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \right) \). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of \( H \), and if so, what its energy is. If not, we need to find the expectation value of \( H \).

First, let me recall some properties of spin operators. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator \( S_i \) is given by \( S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_i \), where \( \sigma_i \) are the Pauli matrices. The dot product of two spin operators \( S_i \cdot S_j \) can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator \( S_{ij}^2 \). Specifically, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 \right) \). Since each particle is spin 1/2, \( S_i^2 = \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \). Therefore, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right) \).

So, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as:
\[
H = A \sum_{i < j} \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right) \right ) = \frac{A}{2} \sum_{i < j} \left( S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right )
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
H = \frac{A}{2} \left( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{2} \right ) = \frac{A}{2} \left( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \right )
\]
Wait, hold on. Wait, the second term is \( \frac{A}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \) because we have three pairs (i,j). So, it's \( \frac{A}{2} \times \frac{9}{2} \hbar^2 = \frac{9}{4} A \hbar^2 \). Hmm, wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, each \( S_i^2 \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \), but in the expression \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2}(S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2) \), so each \( S_i \cdot S_j \) contributes \( \frac{1}{2}(S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 ) = \frac{1}{2}(S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2) \). So, each term in the Hamiltonian is that.

But the Hamiltonian has three terms: \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \), \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \), and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \). So each of these is of the form above. Therefore, the entire Hamiltonian can be written as:
\[
H = A \left( S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 \right ) = A \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{12}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{13}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{23}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right ) \right ]
\]
Simplifying:
\[
H = \frac{A}{2} \left( S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 - \frac{9}{2} \hbar^2 \right )
\]
Which is:
\[
H = \frac{A}{2} \left( S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 \right ) - \frac{A}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{2} \hbar^2
\]
Simplify the constants:
\[
H = \frac{A}{2} \sum_{i<j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{9}{4} A \hbar^2
\]
So, the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the sum of the squares of the total spin of each pair. Now, to analyze whether \( \psi \) is an eigenfunction, we need to find the action of \( H \) on \( \psi \). If \( H \psi \) is proportional to \( \psi \), then \( \psi \) is an eigenfunction.

Alternatively, another approach is to determine the total spin of the state \( \psi \). If the state is in a definite total spin state, then the eigenvalue can be found easily. However, in this case, since we have three particles, the total spin is not as straightforward as in two-particle systems.

Wait, but actually, the state \( \psi \) is given, so perhaps we can compute its total spin. Let me analyze the state \( \psi \):

\( \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle + |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle + |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \right ) \)

Looking at this state, each term has two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, for each term, one particle is down, and the other two are up. So, this is a symmetric state under permutation of particles. Let's check the symmetry.

Each term in the state is a product of up and down spins, with exactly two ups and one down. The state is symmetric because swapping particles 1 and 2 in the first term gives the second term, swapping 1 and 3 gives the third term, etc. So, the state is symmetric under permutation of particles.

Now, the total spin squared operator \( S_{total}^2 \) is the sum of \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2 S_1 \cdot S_2 + 2 S_1 \cdot S_3 + 2 S_2 \cdot S_3 \). Since each \( S_i^2 = \frac{3}{4}\hbar^2 \), we have:

\( S_{total}^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 + 2 \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \)

But in the Hamiltonian, we have \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \), so perhaps we can relate \( H \) to \( S_{total}^2 \).

Indeed, we had earlier that \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{2}{A} (H + \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 ) \). Wait, actually, we had:

\( H = \frac{A}{2} \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{9}{4} A \hbar^2 \)

But \( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 = \sum_{i < j} \left( S_i + S_j \right )^2 - 2 \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \)

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since \( S_{ij}^2 = (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i \cdot S_j \). Therefore, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} (S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2) \).

So, summing over all \( i < j \), we have:
\[
\sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \cdot 3 \right ) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \right )
\]
Which is consistent with our previous expression. So, substituting back into the Hamiltonian:
\[
H = A \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j = A \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{i < j} S_{ij}^2 - \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \right ) = \frac{A}{2} \left( \sum S_{ij}^2 \right ) - \frac{9}{8} A \hbar^2
\]
Wait, that's not matching the previous. Wait, because  \( A \times \frac{1}{2} \times \sum S_{ij}^2 \) and \( A \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \). So, the second term is \( \frac{9}{8} A \hbar^2 \). Hmm, okay.

But maybe instead of going that way, let's think about the eigenvalues. For two spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be either \( s = 1 \) (triplet) or \( s = 0 \) (singlet). The eigenvalues of \( S_{ij}^2 \) for each pair \( i,j \) are \( s_{ij}(s_{ij} + 1) \hbar^2 \), where \( s_{ij} \) is the total spin of the pair.

In the given state \( \psi \), each term has two spins up and one down. Let me try to compute the total spin of this state. Alternatively, I can compute the total spin squared \( S_{total}^2 \) and see whether the state is an eigenstate.

The state \( \psi \) has two spins up and one spin down. Let's compute the action of \( S_z \) on \( \psi \). For each term in \( \psi \), \( S_z \) will act on each spin.

But perhaps a better approach is to determine the total spin \( S_{total}^2 \) eigenvalue. For a system of three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be either \( S = 3/2 \) or \( S = 1/2 \). The state \( \psi \) seems to have a specific configuration, so let's determine whether it's an eigenstate of \( S_{total}^2 \).

Alternatively, we can note that \( \psi \) is a symmetric state under permutation of particles and has two spins up and one spin down. This is similar to a spin state in the symmetric group, so perhaps we can construct it from combinations of spin singlet or triplet states.

Wait, let's think about the possible total spins. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be \( S = 3/2 \) or \( S = 1/2 \). The state \( \psi \) has two spins up and one spin down. Let's see if it aligns with either of these.

If the total spin is \( S = 3/2 \), then \( S_{total}^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \). If \( S = 1/2 \), then \( S_{total}^2 = \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \).

Let me compute \( S_{total}^2 \) for \( \psi \). The state \( \psi \) is a linear combination of three basis states, each with two spins up and one spin down. Let's compute \( S_{total}^2 \psi \).

First, \( S_{total}^2 = \left( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \right )^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2 \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \). Since each \( S_i^2 = 3/4 \hbar^2 \), we have:

\( S_{total}^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 + 2 \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \). Therefore, \( S_{total}^2 \) has eigenvalue \( \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 + 2 \langle \psi | \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j | \psi \rangle \).

So, if we can compute \( \langle \psi | \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j | \psi \rangle \), we can find \( \langle S_{total}^2 \rangle \) and thus possibly the eigenvalue of \( H \).

Alternatively, since \( H \) is expressed in terms of \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \), let's compute \( \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle \) directly.

First, let's compute \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \) acting on \( \psi \). So, \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j = S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3 \).

But maybe a smarter approach is to express \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \) in terms of \( S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{23}^2 \), as we did earlier.

But perhaps I can consider that in the state \( \psi \), each term has two up spins and one down, so the total spin is not necessarily aligned. Therefore, the expectation value of \( S_{total}^2 \) might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, let's compute the action of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \), \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \), and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \) on \( \psi \).

First, note that \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2} (S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2) \). But perhaps using matrix representation will be messy. Alternatively, since each \( S_i \) acts on particle \( i \), perhaps we can consider the action on each term of \( \psi \).

Let me denote \( |a\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \), \( |b\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), and \( |c\rangle = |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \). Then, \( \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (|a\rangle + |b\rangle + |c\rangle) \).

Let's compute \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) acting on \( |a\rangle \), \( |b\rangle \), and \( |c\rangle \).

But since \( S_i \) acts only on spin \( i \), \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) acts on both spins 1 and 2. The matrix for \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) is a 4x4 matrix, but acting on two spins. Alternatively, we can recall that \( S_1 \cdot S_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{12}^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \right ) = \frac{1}{2} \left( S_{12}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 \right ) \).

So, the eigenvalues of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) are \( \frac{1}{2} (s_{12}(s_{12} + 1) \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) \), where \( s_{12} \) is the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

For a pair of spin 1/2 particles, \( s_{12} \) can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) are:

- For \( s_{12} = 1 \): \( \frac{1}{2} (2 \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{4}{2} \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 ) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \)
- For \( s_{12} = 0 \): \( \frac{1}{2} (0 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 \)

Similarly, the same applies for \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \) and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \). Therefore, each of these terms can have eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \) depending on whether the pair is in a triplet or singlet state.

Now, let's compute \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |a\rangle \), \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |b\rangle \), and \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |c\rangle \).

First, consider \( |a\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \). Applying \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) to this state:

- \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |a\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (S_{12}^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) |a\rangle \)

Since \( |a\rangle \) is \( | \uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3 \rangle \), the spins of 1 and 2 are both up. Therefore, the total spin \( s_{12} = 1 \) for this pair. Hence, \( S_{12}^2 |a\rangle = 2 \hbar^2 |a\rangle \). Therefore:

\( S_1 \cdot S_2 |a\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (2 \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) |a\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 |a\rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \).

Similarly, for \( |b\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), the spins of 1 and 2 are \( \uparrow \) and \( \downarrow \), respectively. Wait, no: in \( |b\rangle \), particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down, and particle 3 is up. So, for \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |b\rangle \), we need to determine the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

The state \( |b\rangle \) is \( | \uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3 \rangle \). So, for particles 1 and 2, it's \( | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle \). The total spin for this pair is \( s_{12} = 0 \) (singlet state). Therefore, \( S_{12}^2 |b\rangle = 0 |b\rangle \).

Hence, \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |b\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (0 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) |b\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \).

Similarly, for \( |c\rangle = |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), particles 1 and 2 are \( | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \), which is also a singlet state, so \( s_{12} = 0 \). Therefore, \( S_1 \cdot S_2 |c\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

Therefore, the action of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) on \( \psi \) is:

\( S_1 \cdot S_2 \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} ( S_1 \cdot S_2 |a\rangle + S_1 \cdot S_2 |b\rangle + S_1 \cdot S_2 |c\rangle ) \)
\( = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle - \frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \right ) \)
\( = \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} \left( \frac{1}{4} |a\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |b\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |c\rangle \right ) \)

Similarly, we can compute the action of \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \) and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \) on \( \psi \).

Let's compute \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \):

For \( |a\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are \( | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle \). This is a singlet state, so \( s_{13} = 0 \). Therefore, \( S_{13}^2 |a\rangle = 0 |a\rangle \), and \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |a\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (0 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) |a\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \).

For \( |b\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are \( | \uparrow \uparrow \rangle \), which is a triplet state with \( s_{13} = 1 \). Therefore, \( S_{13}^2 |b\rangle = 2 \hbar^2 |b\rangle \), and \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |b\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (2 \hbar^2 - \frac{3}{2} \hbar^2 ) |b\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 |b\rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \).

For \( |c\rangle = |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are \( | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \), which is a singlet state, so \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |c\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

Thus, \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \psi = \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} \left( -\frac{3}{4} |a\rangle + \frac{1}{4} |b\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |c\rangle \right ) \).

Similarly, compute \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \):

For \( |a\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are \( | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle \), singlet, so \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |a\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \).

For \( |b\rangle = |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are \( | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle \), singlet, so \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |b\rangle = -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \).

For \( |c\rangle = |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are \( | \uparrow \uparrow \rangle \), triplet, so \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |c\rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

Therefore, \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \psi = \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} \left( -\frac{3}{4} |a\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |b\rangle + \frac{1}{4} |c\rangle \right ) \).

Now, let's sum up the actions of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \), \( S_1 \cdot S_3 \), and \( S_2 \cdot S_3 \) on \( \psi \):

Total action = \( S_1 \cdot S_2 | \psi \rangle + S_1 \cdot S_3 | \psi \rangle + S_2 \cdot S_3 | \psi \rangle \)

Substituting:

= \( \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} [ ( \frac{1}{4} |a\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |b\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |c\rangle ) + ( -\frac{3}{4} |a\rangle + \frac{1}{4} |b\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |c\rangle ) + ( -\frac{3}{4} |a\rangle - \frac{3}{4} |b\rangle + \frac{1}{4} |c\rangle ) ] \)

Let's compute each coefficient:

For |a\rangle: \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{6}{4} = -\frac{5}{4} \)

For |b\rangle: \( -\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = (-\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4}) + \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{5}{4} \)

For |c\rangle: \( -\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = (-\frac{6}{4} ) + \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{5}{4} \)

Therefore, total action:

= \( \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \left( -\frac{5}{4} |a\rangle - \frac{5}{4} |b\rangle - \frac{5}{4} |c\rangle \right ) \)
= \( -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} (|a\rangle + |b\rangle + |c\rangle ) \)
= \( -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \)

So, \( \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \psi = -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \).

Now, recalling the expression for \( H \):

\( H = A \sum_{i < j} S_i \cdot S_j \)

Therefore, \( H \psi = A \cdot \left( -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \right ) \psi = -\frac{5 A \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \)

Wait, but according to the initial claim, the eigenvalue should be \( \frac{2}{3} A \hbar^2 \). Hmm, this seems conflicting. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let's double-check the calculation. When I summed up the coefficients for each basis state |a\rangle, |b\rangle, |c\rangle, I got each coefficient as -5/4. But let's verify:

For |a\rangle:

From S1S2: +1/4

From S1S3: -3/4

From S2S3: -3/4

Total: 1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4 = (1 - 3 - 3)/4 = (-5)/4.

Similarly for |b\rangle:

From S1S2: -3/4

From S1S3: +1/4

From S2S3: -3/4

Total: (-3 + 1 - 3)/4 = (-5)/4.

Same for |c\rangle:

From S1S2: -3/4

From S1S3: -3/4

From S2S3: +1/4

Total: (-3 - 3 + 1)/4 = (-5)/4.

So that's correct. So, the total is indeed -5/4 for each. Therefore, the total action is:

= \( \frac{\hbar^2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot (-\frac{5}{4}) (|a\rangle + |b\rangle + |c\rangle ) = -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \).

Therefore, \( H \psi = -\frac{5 A \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \).

But the claim is that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue \( \frac{2}{3} A \hbar^2 \). That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me check the action of \( S_i \cdot S_j \) on each state.

Wait, when I applied \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) to |a\rangle, I got \( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \) because |a\rangle is triplet.

Similarly, for |b\rangle, since particles 1 and 2 are in a singlet state, I got \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \). That seems correct.

Similarly for |c\rangle, same as |b\rangle, so \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

Then, for \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |a\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are in singlet, so \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \).

For \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |b\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are in triplet, so \( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \).

For \( S_1 \cdot S_3 |c\rangle \), particles 1 and 3 are in singlet, so \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

Similarly, for \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |a\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are in singlet, so \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |a\rangle \).

For \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |b\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are in singlet, so \( -\frac{3}{4} \hbar^2 |b\rangle \).

For \( S_2 \cdot S_3 |c\rangle \), particles 2 and 3 are in triplet, so \( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 |c\rangle \).

So, all steps seem correct.

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sum S_i \cdot S_j \) is \( -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \), leading to \( H \psi = -\frac{5 A \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \).

But according to the initial claim, the eigenvalue should be \( \frac{2}{3} A \hbar^2 \). So, either I made a mistake in calculation, or perhaps the state is not an eigenstate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute \( H \psi \) differently. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the state \( \psi \) is symmetric under permutation, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared \( S_{total}^2 \), which would make it an eigenstate of \( H \).

Wait, let's compute \( S_{total}^2 \psi \). Recall that \( S_{total} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \), so \( S_{total}^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2 \sum S_i \cdot S_j \).

We have \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \), so \( S_{total}^2 = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 + 2 \sum S_i \cdot S_j \).

From earlier, we found that \( \sum S_i \cdot S_j \psi = -\frac{5 \hbar^2}{4 \sqrt{3}} \psi \), so \( S_{total}^2 \psi = \frac{9}{4} \hbar^2 \psi + 2 \cdot \left( -\frac{5 \hbar^2
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about a system of three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, find its energy. If not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem. We have three spin-1/2 particles, so each can be either spin-up or spin-down. The Hamiltonian is a sum of dot products of the spin operators. Since each dot product S_i·S_j involves the sum of the products of their components, which for spin-1/2 particles would be S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z.

The state psi is given as a symmetric combination of three terms. Each term has two spins up and one spin down. For example, the first term is up1*up2*down3, meaning particles 1 and 2 are spin-up, and particle 3 is spin-down. The coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), so it's an equal superposition of these three states.

I need to check if psi is an eigenfunction of H. To do this, I can compute H acting on psi and see if it's proportional to psi, which would mean psi is an eigenstate. If not, then the expectation value is needed.

But before jumping into calculations, maybe I can find some symmetries or properties of H and the state psi to simplify the problem.

First, note that the Hamiltonian is symmetric under exchange of particles. That is, H is invariant under swapping particles 1 and 2, 1 and 3, or 2 and 3. Similarly, the state psi is also symmetric because it's a sum of all possible states where two particles are up and one is down. So swapping any two particles would leave both H and psi unchanged.

So both the Hamiltonian and the state have the same symmetry, which might be useful.

Another thought: The Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let's recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared.

Wait, yes, there's a formula for S_i·S_j. For two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

Given that each spin is 1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ² ] / 2 = [ (S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² ) ] / 2.

Therefore, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2.

Wait, but this is for a pair. But here, H is the sum of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, perhaps we can express H in terms of the total spin operators.

Let me denote S = S1 + S2 + S3.

Then, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be written as (1/2)[ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] + (1/2)[ (S1 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S3^2 ] + (1/2)[ (S2 + S3)^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ].

Expanding this, we have:

(1/2)[ S1^2 + 2 S1·S2 + S2^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] + (1/2)[ S1^2 + 2 S1·S3 + S3^2 - S1^2 - S3^2 ] + (1/2)[ S2^2 + 2 S2·S3 + S3^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ]

Simplify each term:

First term: (1/2)[ 2 S1·S2 ] = S1·S2

Second term: (1/2)[ 2 S1·S3 ] = S1·S3

Third term: (1/2)[ 2 S2·S3 ] = S2·S3

Therefore, H = S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is the same as the given expression. So that approach didn't help much.

Alternatively, maybe note that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is related to (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). Let me compute this.

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2.

Since each S_i² = (3/4)ħ², the total sum is 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

So S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(sum of dot products) = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(sum of dot products).

Therefore, sum of dot products = [ S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ] / 2.

So H = A*(sum of dot products) = A*[ S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ] / 2.

Therefore, H = (A/2)*( S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ).

Thus, H can be written in terms of S_total².

Now, the eigenfunctions of H would be eigenfunctions of S_total². Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² for the given state psi, then I can find the expectation value of H.

So let me compute S_total² acting on psi.

But first, what is the total spin S_total for the state psi?

Given that psi is symmetric under particle exchange, and consists of states with two up and one down spin. Let me think about the possible total spin states.

Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So the total spin S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So the total spin is S = S_z, which is 1/2. So S_total² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Wait, but is that correct? Because the state is symmetric, maybe it's a singlet or triplet state? Wait, for three particles, the total spin can be 1, 0, or -1? Wait, no, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=1, S=0, or S=1/2. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, actually, three spin-1/2 particles can combine in different ways. Each pair can combine to spin 1 or 0, but when combining three, the possible total spins are 1, 0, and 1/2.

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me try to recall.

When combining three 1/2 spins, the possible total spins are:

- All three aligned: S=3/2.

- Two aligned, one opposite: S=1/2.

But wait, that's incorrect. Because when combining three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be S=1, S=0, S=1/2.

Wait, here's a better approach. The total spin can be obtained by combining two particles first, then combining the result with the third.

So, for two particles, S=1 or S=0.

Then, combining each with the third particle.

Case 1: Two particles have S=1. Then, combining with the third (1/2) gives possible total spins 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 and |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Case 2: Two particles have S=0. Then, combining with the third (1/2) gives possible total spins 0 + 1/2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the possible total spins for three particles are 3/2, 1/2, and 1/2, and 1. Wait, but 3/2, 1, and 1/2.

Wait, I think that the total spin can be 3/2, 1, or 1/2.

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, when you have three particles, you can have:

- All three aligned: (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) = 3/2.

- Two aligned, one opposite: There are different configurations depending on which one is opposite. Since each spin is 1/2, for two up, one down, or two down, one up, etc. So perhaps the total spin is 1/2.

Wait, but the exact total spin depends on the symmetry and the state.

In our case, the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles. So, if all three are symmetric, they must have a total spin which is symmetric.

Wait, in the case of three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric state would have total spin S=3/2, since the symmetric representation is the highest weight.

Alternatively, if the state is symmetric, it can't have S=1/2. Wait, maybe let's think in terms of how the states transform.

Wait, the state psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down. So each term is a product state with two up and one down.

If we think of this as a state with total spin S=1/2, which is symmetric, then yes.

But wait, actually, in three particles, the state with two up and one down could have different total spin depending on how they are arranged.

Wait, perhaps my confusion is because with three particles, the total spin isn't just the sum of individual spins, but the total spin S is determined by the combination.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute S_total² for the state psi.

So S_total² is the sum of S_i · S_j over i < j. So S_total² = S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Wait a second, that's exactly the same as H when A=1. So in that case, H is proportional to S_total².

Therefore, the eigenvalue of S_total² on psi will give me the eigenvalue for H.

So, if I can compute the expectation value of S_total² in psi, then H = (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

So if I can find <S_total²>, then I can compute <H> = (A/2)*( <S_total²> - (9/4)ħ² ).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <H> directly.

But let me try computing <S_total²> first.

Given that S_total² = S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Therefore, the expectation value is <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>.

Since the state is symmetric, all these terms should be equal. So <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>, so 3*<S1·S2>.

Therefore, <S_total²> = 3*<S1·S2>.

Thus, I just need to compute <S1·S2> for the given state psi.

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

The expectation value <S1·S2> is the sum of the expectations of each component.

So let's compute <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi> + <psi| S1^y S2^y |psi> + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

But that might be a bit involved, but maybe we can find a shortcut.

Note that S1^x and S2^x are not diagonal in the computational basis (since the computational basis is eigenstates of S1^z and S2^z), so their expectation values might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Recall that for spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (ħ / 2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ² / 4) (σ1·σ2).

Computing σ1·σ2, we get σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ² / 4)(σ1·σ2).

Thus, <S1·S2> = (ħ² / 4) <σ1·σ2>.

So to compute <σ1·σ2>, we can use the state psi.

So the state psi is (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ).

Each term in psi is a product state. Let's write them out:

Term 1: |↑↑↓⟩
Term 2: |↑↓↑⟩
Term 3: |↓↑↑⟩

Note that each term has two |↑⟩ and one |↓⟩.

Now, let's compute <σ1·σ2> for each term and then average over the state.

But first, let's note that in each term, the first two particles are |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩.

Wait, but σ1 and σ2 are Pauli matrices for particles 1 and 2. So S1·S2 is an operator acting on particles 1 and 2, while the third particle is in a definite state in each term.

Therefore, in each term |...⟩, the third particle is fixed (either ↑ or ↓), but particles 1 and 2 are in a combined state.

So in term 1: |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both |↑⟩.

Term 2: |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 is |↑⟩, particle 2 is |↓⟩.

Term 3: |↓↑↑⟩: particles 1 is |↓⟩, particle 2 is |↑⟩.

So, for each term, I can represent it as a tensor product of the state of particles 1 and 2, and the state of particle 3.

So, in term 1: particles 1 and 2 are |↑↑⟩, particle 3 is |↓⟩.

Similarly, term 2: particles 1 and 2 are |↑↓⟩, particle 3 is |↑⟩.

Term 3: particles 1 and 2 are |↓↑⟩, particle 3 is |↑⟩.

So, the state psi is:

( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3)

Now, we can write the operator σ1·σ2 acting on particles 1 and 2, and it's diagonal in the computational basis because it's a combination of σ1^x σ2^x, σ1^y σ2^y, σ1^z σ2^z.

Wait, actually, σ1·σ2 is diagonal in the product basis |s1, s2⟩ where s1 and s2 are spin-up or spin-down.

Because σ1·σ2 = I ⊗ I + σ^z ⊗ σ^z - i σ^x ⊗ σ^y - i σ^y ⊗ σ^x.

Wait, no, actually, for two particles, the operator σ1·σ2 is given by:

σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

In the basis |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, the matrix representation of σ1·σ2 can be computed.

Alternatively, since in each term of psi, particles 1 and 2 are in a specific state, perhaps we can compute the expectation value for each term.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, write down what each term is.

Term 1: |↑↑↓⟩
Term 2: |↑↓↑⟩
Term 3: |↓↑↑⟩

So, for each term, we can compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2.

Given that the state is a sum of these three terms, the expectation value <σ1·σ2> is the average of the expectations in each term.

So, <σ1·σ2> = [ <↑↑↓|σ1·σ2|↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↓↑|σ1·σ2|↑↓↑⟩ + <↓↑↑|σ1·σ2|↓↑↑⟩ ] / 3.

Wait, no, because when you take the expectation value in a superposition, the off-diagonal terms can contribute as well. So perhaps a better approach is to compute it using the density matrix or by expanding.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, maybe the expectation value can be computed as follows.

Note that in each term, particles 1 and 2 are either |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩, each appearing once in the three terms.

So, compute for each possible combination of s1 and s2:

s1 = ↑, s2 = ↑
s1 = ↑, s2 = ↓
s1 = ↓, s2 = ↑
s1 = ↓, s2 = ↓

But in the state psi, each of these combinations is present once, except that the third particle is either ↑ or ↓.

So, let's compute the expectation value <σ1·σ2> for each possible s1 and s2 in the product states.

So, for each term in psi, we have particles 1 and 2 in one of the four possible spin states, and the third particle is fixed. The expectation value of σ1·σ2 in each term can be computed as follows.

First, compute the matrix representation of σ1·σ2 in the basis { |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩ }.

The matrix for σ1·σ2 is:

For |↑↑⟩:
σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = ( |↑↑⟩ + |↓↓⟩ ) because σ1^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩, similarly for σ1^y σ2^y.

Wait, maybe it's better to actually compute the matrix elements.

For two particles, the operator σ1·σ2 has the following matrix:

In basis |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩:

σ1·σ2:

|↑↑⟩: (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1.

Wait, no, actually, let me think of the operator.

σ1·σ2 can be written in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices.

We have:

σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Each term can be represented as:

σ^z is diagonal, with entries [1, -1].

σ^x and σ^y are off-diagonal.

For two particles, σ1^x σ2^x is a tensor product:

σ1^x ⊗ σ2^x.

Similarly for σ1^y and σ1^z.

So, σ1^x σ2^x has the following matrix:

[ [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0] ]

Wait, no. Wait, in the basis |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, the tensor products would be:

σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ1^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩
σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩

Therefore, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑⟩ = σ1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩
Similarly, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩
σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑⟩ = |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩
σ1^x σ2^x |↓↓⟩ = |↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩

So, σ1^x σ2^x swaps the spins of both particles.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y is similar but with an additional complex factor because of the i's in the Pauli matrices.

But perhaps instead of computing the entire matrix, it's easier to compute the expectation value in each basis state.

For each basis state, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is:

|↑↑⟩: <↑↑|σ1·σ2|↑↑⟩ = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, σ1·σ2 = 3/4 I for two spin-1/2 particles. Because for each particle, S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ², so S_i·S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2)/2, but in this case, for two particles, S_i + S_j squared is S_{i+j}^2, which for spin 1/2 particles would be S=0 or 1.

Wait, no, wait, I think I confused something.

Wait, no, for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 1 or 0.

If S=1, then S1·S2 = (S(S+1) - S1(S1+1) - S2(S2+1)) ) / 2.

Since S1 = S2 = 1/2, their squares are 3/4, so S1·S2 = (S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (S(S+1) - 3/2)/2.

If S=1: (2 - 3/2)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4.

If S=0: (0 - 3/2)/2 = (-3/2)/2 = -3/4.

Therefore, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is either 1/4 (if S=1) or -3/4 (if S=0).

But in our case, the state is a combination of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as follows.

In the computational basis, for two particles, the operator σ1·σ2 has the following effect:

σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩, because σ1^z σ2^z |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩, and σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩, but wait, hold on.

Wait, actually, σ1^x σ2^x, σ1^y σ2^y, σ1^z σ2^z each act on particles 1 and 2.

So, let me compute σ1·σ2 acting on each basis state:

1. |↑↑⟩:

σ1^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, so σ1^z σ2^z |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

σ1^y σ2^y |↑↑⟩ = i |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, so σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = (|↑↑⟩ + i |↓↓⟩).

Wait, no, we have to compute σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩ + i |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩?

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Thus, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = (σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z) |↑↑⟩

= |↓↓⟩ + i |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩.

So, in total, (1 + i)|↓↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩.

Wait, that seems complicated.

But perhaps when computing the expectation value, it's better to use the fact that σ1·σ2 is a Hermitian operator, and compute <σ1·σ2> in each state.

But this might get too involved.

Alternatively, since the system is two particles, we can compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in each of the four product states |s1 s2⟩, and then find the average.

But the state psi for two particles would be ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3). But in our case, for three particles, each term in psi is a two-particle state combined with a third particle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to separate the third particle.

Each term in psi is a product of a two-particle state and a third particle.

So, for each term, say |↑↑↓⟩, the state of particles 1 and 2 is |↑↑⟩, and particle 3 is |↓⟩.

So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in this term is <↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩.

From earlier, that would be 1, because in |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩ + i |↓↓⟩, so the expectation value is <↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = 1.

Wait, but no, that's not correct, because in reality, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the singlet state (which is antisymmetric) is -3/4, and in the triplet states (symmetric) it is 1/4.

Wait, actually, maybe I was overcomplicating earlier.

In the two-particle system, the singlet state is ( |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2), with S=0, so <σ1·σ2> = -3/4.

Triplet states are three states:

( |↑↑⟩ ), ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2), and ( |↓↓⟩ ).

Each of these has S=1, S=1, S=0, S=1.

Wait, actually, the triplet states have S=1, so their expectation value is 1/4.

The singlet state has S=0, so expectation value is -3/4.

So, in our case, for the two-particle states in each term of psi, which are |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, and |↓↑⟩, we can see that each occurs once.

Therefore, in the two-particle part, the state is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3). Let's compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

But since S1·S2 is same as (1/2)(S_{12}^2 - 3/4 ħ²), where S_{12} = S1 + S2.

But maybe it's better to compute the expectation value directly.

Given that the state of two particles is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3), which is symmetric, so it's one of the triplet states with S=1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the triplet states for two particles are |↑↑⟩, ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2), and |↓↓⟩.

But our state is ( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(3).

So, it's not normalized correctly for a triplet state. Wait, actually, no, in our case, it's for three particles.

Wait, let me clarify.

In our three-particle system, each term in psi is a product of two-particle state and a third particle.

Therefore, the two-particle part in each term can be |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩.

So, when we compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2, we can consider the contributions from each of these two-particle states.

So, for each term, in the two-particle state, what is the expectation value of σ1·σ2?

In |↑↑⟩, the expectation value is 1.

In |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩, the expectation value is (1/4) each, since those are triplet states with S=1.

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the triplet state ( |↑↑⟩, ( |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) / sqrt(2), |↓↓⟩ ) is 1/4 for each state.

Wait, no, actually, no. The expectation value of S1·S2 for each triplet state is 1/4.

Wait, let me confirm.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the operator S1·S2 is given by:

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

In the computational basis, for each basis state |s1 s2⟩, the expectation value is:

For |↑↑⟩: (1/2)(1/2 + 1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4. Wait, no, that's S1^2 and S2^2.

Wait, no, S1·S2 is  ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

So, for |↑↑⟩, S1 + S2 is S=1, so (S(S+1) - 3/2 ) / 2 = (2 - 3/2)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4.

Similarly, for |↓↓⟩: same as |↑↑⟩, expectation value is 1/4.

For |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩: S1 + S2 is spin 0, so (0 - 3/2)/2 = -3/4.

Wait, but in our case, the two-particle states in the three-particle state psi are |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, and |↓↑⟩.

Each occurs once in the sum, so the expectation value for the two-particle part is:

( <↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ + <↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩ + <↓↑| σ1·σ2 |↓↑⟩ ) / 3

= (1/4 + (-3/4) + (-3/4)) / 3

= (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) / 3

= (-6/4) / 3

= (-6/4) * (1/3)

= (-6/12) = -1/2.

Wait, that gives -1/2.

But wait, that can't be, because each two-particle state is part of a three-particle state where the third particle is fixed.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Because the two-particle state is not independent of the third particle.

Wait, in each term of psi, the two-particle state is entangled with the third particle.

So, maybe I should compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2 for the entire three-particle state.

But perhaps I can instead compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state psi.

Since S1·S2 is a two-particle operator, we can write the expectation value as:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = <psi| (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ) |psi>

Let's compute each term:

First, compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4) |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2) |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4) |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, the matrix elements:

<psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/4) <↑↑↓|psi> + (-1/4) <↑↓↑|psi> + (-1/4) <↓↑↑|psi>

But |psi> is a symmetric combination, so:

= (1/4)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-1/4)(1/sqrt(3)) + (-1/4)(1/sqrt(3))

= [1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4] / sqrt(3)

= (-1/4)/sqrt(3)

Similarly, compute <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi>.

S1^x S2^x is a bit more involved because it flips spins.

Let's compute S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, S2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = S1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^x |↓⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑⟩ = S1^x |↓⟩ ⊗ S2^x |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↑↓
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin-1/2 particles and a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what its energy is. If not, I need to find the expectation value of the energy.

First, I need to recall what an eigenfunction of H would look like. Since H is a sum of dot products of spin operators, it's related to the total spin or the exchange interactions between the particles. Spin-1/2 particles have spin operators S_i, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2, S_i = ħ/2 * σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

The state psi is given as a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let me analyze this state first. Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. The coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), so it's an equally weighted combination of the three possible states where each particle has a spin up or down, but with exactly two up and one down. This is similar to a coherently superposed state in spin systems.

Now, to determine if psi is an eigenfunction of H, I need to see if H acting on psi gives a scalar multiple of psi. Alternatively, if I can find the eigenvalues of H acting on psi, or compute the expectation value, that would answer the question.

But since H is a sum of dot products of spin operators, perhaps I can find a relationship in terms of total spin. Let me recall that the dot product S_i · S_j = (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2), where S_ij is the total spin of particles i and j. So, S_i · S_j = (S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2)/4.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A/4*( (S1^2 + S2^2 + S1^2 + S3^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 ) - (S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2) )

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 - S12^2)/4, so H becomes:

H = A/4 [ (S1^2 + S2^2 + S1^2 + S3^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 ) - (S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2) ]

But S1^2 and S2^2 and S3^2 are all ( ħ²/4 ) * (2S(2S+1)), but since each particle is spin 1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ².

So S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ².

So plugging in, H becomes:

H = A/4 [ (3*(3/4) ħ² ) - (S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2) ]

So, H = A/4 [ (9/4) ħ² - (S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2) ]

Simplify that:

H = A/4 * [ (9 ħ² /4 ) - ( S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 ) ]

So, H = (9 A ħ²)/16 - (A/4)(S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 )

But S12^2 is the square of the total spin for particles 1 and 2. Similarly for the others. So, S12^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the total spin. The total spin squared is S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, from that, we can express S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 in terms of S_total^2.

Let me compute S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2.

We have S12^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2

Similarly,

S13^2 = S1^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S3

S23^2 = S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S2·S3

So adding these up:

S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 = 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

But S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is the same as the sum we have in H, except without the factor of A.

So, going back, S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 = 2(3*(3/4) ħ² ) + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, that's 2*(9/4 ħ²)/2? Wait, no, 3*(3/4 ħ²) is 9/4 ħ² for each term? Wait, no, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 is 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

Wait, so S12^2 + S13^2 + S23^2 = 2*(9/4 ħ²) + 2*(sum of dot products)

But sum of dot products is (H)/(A) - (9 A ħ²)/16 * something. Wait, no, maybe I should express S_total^2.

We have S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )) / 2

So, then, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ² ) / 2 )

So H = A*( S_total^2 / 2 - (9/4) ħ² * (3/2) )

Wait, let me compute:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2)/2 = (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4 ħ² )) / 2

So H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 )

Thus, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A /8 ) ħ²

So, H can be written as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A /8 ) ħ²

Hmm, that seems useful.

Therefore, if I can find S_total^2 acting on psi, that would help me find H psi.

So, I need to compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

But what is S_total^2? It's (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Which, when acting on a state, can be written as S1^2 psi + S2^2 psi + S3^2 psi + 2(S1·S2 psi + S1·S3 psi + S2·S3 psi )

But since S1^2, S2^2, and S3^2 all act as (3/4 ħ²) on any spin state, and S_i^2 |psi> = (3/4 ħ²)|psi> because spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, but S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, so it acts diagonally in the total spin basis.

So, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it can be written as a combination of spin states with specific total S.

Wait, let me think. The state psi is a symmetric combination of two spins up and one down. So perhaps this is a state with certain total spin. Maybe we can compute its total spin.

To find the eigenvalue of S_total^2, I need to find |psi> up to rotation in spinor space.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write S_total^2 in terms of individual S_i · S_j.

Wait, we already have H expressed in terms of S_total^2, so maybe that's useful. Alternatively, let me think of S_total^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i · S_j, which is similar to the expression above.

But since I have H expressed as A/2 S_total^2 - 9A ħ² /8, then H is a linear function of S_total^2, so if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it is an eigenstate of H.

So, the key is to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 on psi.

So, let me compute S_total^2 |psi> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

Expressing this operator, we get:

S_total^2 |psi> = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )) |psi>

But, as earlier, S1·S2 |psi> is ( (1/4)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S12^2 ) ) |psi>

Wait, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for a state |psi>, the expectation value of S_total^2 is <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

Given that S_total^2 is the sum of S_i^2 plus twice the sum of S_i·S_j.

So, <S_total^2> = <psi| (sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j ) |psi> = sum <S_i^2> + 2 sum <S_i·S_j>

We know that each <S_i^2> is (3/4) ħ², so sum <S_i^2> = 3*(3/4) ħ² = (9/4) ħ².

Now, the other term is 2 sum <S_i·S_j> = 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But H is A*(sum S_i·S_j), so <H> = A*(sum <S_i·S_j> )

So, if I can compute sum <S_i·S_j>, which is the same as ( <H> ) / A.

So, maybe I can compute <H> another way and then relate it.

Alternatively, let me try to compute <S_total^2> as follows:

Since <S_total^2> = (sum <S_i^2> ) + 2 sum <S_i·S_j> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 sum <S_i·S_j>

But sum <S_i·S_j> = 1/2 < S_total^2 - sum S_i^2 >, but that's similar to earlier.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = <psi| (sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j ) |psi>

Which is sum <psi| S_i^2 |psi> + 2 sum <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>

We already know that <psi| S_i^2 |psi> = (3/4) ħ² for each i.

Thus, sum <S_i^2> = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, <psi| S_i·S_j |psi> for i ≠ j. Let's compute this expectation value.

So, for a given pair, say particles 1 and 2, <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Since S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

So, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = <psi| (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ) |psi>

But since the state is symmetric in the spins, maybe I can find this expectation value by considering the structure of psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each pair, the expectation value is the same, so let me compute <S1·S2> and then multiply by 3.

So, let me compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

To compute this, I can express S1·S2 as (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

But perhaps an easier way is to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi> using the definition of spin operators.

Alternatively, since spin-1/2 particles, perhaps I can think in terms of the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, the state psi is symmetric in two spins up and one down. Let me think of particles 1,2,3. Each term in psi has exactly two up spins and one down spin.

So, perhaps I can write psi as a combination of states with two up and one down, but with a certain symmetry.

Let me see: each term in psi has two up and one down, so it's a state with S_z = 1/2 * 2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, S_z = 1/2.

Wait, each term has two up spins (each +1/2) and one down spin (-1/2), so total S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So, the state psi has S_z = 1/2.

But what about the total spin S_total? Is this state an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Given that S_total^2 commutes with S_z, and if the state is eigenstate of both, it's a common eigenstate.

But I don't know if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the eigenvalues of S_total^2 for this state. Since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, and the states are organized into multiplets with different S_total.

Given that S_total^2 has eigenvalues S(S+1) ħ², where S is the total spin.

So, to find S_total^2 |psi>, maybe we can find the action of S_total^2 on |psi>.

But perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the expectation value <S_total^2> and also the expectation value H, then relate them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's useful to note that the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles.

Wait, actually, in this case, psi is symmetric only in the sense that it's a symmetric sum of all states with two up and one down. So, it's symmetric under exchange of particles, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, actually, S_total^2 is invariant under permutation of particles, so any permutation of the particles will leave S_total^2 |psi> = S_total^2 |psi>

Which suggests that the state is in a multiplet where S_total^2 is the same regardless of permutation.

But perhaps I can find S_total^2 acting on the basis states. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's helpful to write down the state in terms of the tensor product basis.

Each term in psi is a product state with two up and one down.

So, we can represent the basis as |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, each appearing with coefficient 1/sqrt(3).

So, perhaps, it's a symmetric state.

But when S_total^2 acts on this state, it will mix these basis states with different total spin.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S_total^2 acting on each term.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

We have S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, as before, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >

We already know that <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ², so sum is 9/4 ħ².

So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ), so <H> = A <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*( <H> / A )

So, if I can compute <H> in another way, I can solve for <S_total^2>, and then relate it to <H>.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <H> directly.

Let me recall that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, <H> = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

Now, because the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles, the expectation values <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3> are all equal.

So, <H> = 3 A <S1·S2>

Thus, <H> = 3 A <S1·S2>

So, if I can compute <S1·S2> for the state psi, I can get <H>.

So, let me compute <S1·S2>. Since S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

Let me compute <S1^z S2^z> first.

In the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin.

So, for each term, the z-component of spin for the first two particles:

- In |↑↑↓⟩: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2
- In |↑↓↑⟩: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2
- In |↓↑↑⟩: S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2

But when I take the average <S1^z S2^z>, it would be:

(1/3)[ (1/2 * 1/2) + (1/2 * (-1/2)) + (-1/2 * 1/2) ]

So, (1/3)[ 1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4 ] = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12

So, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12 ħ²

Similarly, <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y> can be computed.

But for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x can be computed using the properties of spin states.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states have well-known expectation values.

In the singlet state, S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ², and in the triplet states, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

Wait, no, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the singlet state is (S1·S2)_{singlet} = (0(0+1) - 3/4) ħ² = (-3/4) ħ²

In the triplet states, which have S=1, the expectation value is (S(S+1) - 3/4 ) ħ².

Wait, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2

So, in the triplet states, S_total^2 = 2 ħ², so S1·S2 = (2 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 3/2)/2 ħ² = (0.5)/2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

For two spin 1/2 particles,

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

The singlet state has total spin S=0, so S1·S2 = (0(0+1) - 3/4) ħ² = (-3/4) ħ²

The triplet states have S=1, so S1·S2 = (1(1+1) - 3/4 ) ħ² = (2 - 3/4) ħ² = (5/4) ħ²

Wait, no, that can't be, because the singlet is S=0 and the triplet is S=1. But S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2

So, substitute S_total^2 = (S(S+1)) ħ² = 0 for singlet, 2 ħ² for triplet.

So, S1·S2 = ( (S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) ) / 2 = ( (S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ² ) ) / 2

So, for singlet, S_total^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = ( - 3/2 ħ² ) /2 = -3/4 ħ²

For triplet, S_total^2 = 2 ħ², so S1·S2 = (2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ² ) / 2 = ( (4/2 - 3/2) ) ħ² / 2 = (1/2) ħ² / 2 = 1/4 ħ²

So, that's correct.

Therefore, for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state has S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ², and the triplet states have S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

So, the state psi is a combination of triplet states? Wait, each term in psi is a product state with two up and one down. So, maybe each term is a triplet state.

Wait, no, because they are product states, not entangled.

Wait, no, in our case, the state psi is a superposition of product states, each with two up and one down. So, each product state is not an eigenstate of S1·S2, but rather a combination.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

Given that psi is a symmetric combination of all product states with two up and one down.

So, each product state is a basis state.

Compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Since S1·S2 is a Hermitian operator, this is equal to the sum over all basis states |a>, |b> of <a|psi><psi|b> <a| S1·S2 |b>

So, let me list all the basis states:

|a> = |↑↑↓〉

|b> = |↑↓↑〉

|c> = |↓↑↑〉

So, psi = (|a> + |b> + |c>)/sqrt(3)

So, compute <a| S1·S2 |a>:

But in |a>, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

But for S1·S2, it's S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

So, for |a>, which is |↑↑↓〉, S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y are a bit more complicated.

But, in the spin-z basis, |↑↑↓〉 is an eigenstate of S1^z and S2^z, but not of S1^x or S2^x or S1^y or S2^y.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that since each term in psi is a product state, the expectation value <a| S1·S2 |a> is just (1/2)(1/2) + 0 + 0 = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Wait, but no, because S1·S2 includes S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y, which are not diagonal in the z basis.

Therefore, I can't just take the expectation value of S1^z S2^z and ignore the others. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in the two-spin system, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state is the expectation value of S1^z S2^z, since S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y have zero expectation in product states.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, in a product state, like |↑↑〉, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x is zero because S1^x |↑〉 = (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2), similarly for S2^x.

So, <↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑〉 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 <↑| S1^x |↑〉 <↑| S2^x |↑〉 ?

Wait, no, because S1^x is acting on the first particle, and S2^x is acting on the second.

So, in |↑↑〉, S1^x S2^x |↑↑〉 = ( (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) ) ⊗ ( (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) )

So, this gives terms |↓↓〉, |↓↑〉, |↑↓〉, |↑↑〉, all multiplied by 1/2.

Taking the inner product with |↑↑〉, only the |↑↑〉 term survives, giving 1/2.

So, <↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑〉 = 1/2.

Similarly, <↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑〉 = ?

Well, S1^y |↑〉 = i|↓〉, and S2^y |↑〉 = i|↓〉, so S1^y S2^y |↑↑〉 = i^2 |↓↓〉 = -|↓↓〉.

So, <↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑〉 = <↑↑| - |↓↓〉 = 0.

Therefore, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑〉 = <↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑〉 + <↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑〉 + <↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑〉 = 1/2 + 0 + 1/4 = 3/4.

Wait, that's unexpected.

Wait, for |↑↑〉, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2) + 0 + 0 = 1/4 in the z basis? But according to this calculation, it's 3/4?

Wait, that must be wrong. Wait, S1·S2 in terms of Pauli matrices is (ħ/2)^2 (σ1·σ2). For two spin 1/2 particles, σ1·σ2 = 3 for triplet states and -1 for singlet. So, for |↑↑〉, which is a triplet, (σ1·σ2) |↑↑〉 = 3 |↑↑〉, so S1·S2 |↑↑〉 = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑〉.

So, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑〉 = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, for |↓↓〉, it's the same.

But for |↑↓〉, it's a singlet state, so σ1·σ2 |↑↓〉 = -|↑↓〉, so S1·S2 |↑↓〉 = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓〉.

Wait, so perhaps for the product states, the expectation value is either 3/4 ħ² for |↑↑〉, |↑↑〉, |↓↓〉, and -1/4 ħ² for |↑↓〉, |↓↑〉.

Wait, in our state psi, the terms are |↑↑↓〉, |↑↓↑〉, |↓↑↑〉.

So, when we compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, that is, <a + b + c| S1·S2 |a + b + c>

Which expands to <a| S1·S2 |a> + <a| S1·S2 |b> + <a| S1·S2 |c> + <b| S1·S2 |a> + <b| S1·S2 |b> + <b| S1·S2 |c> + <c| S1·S2 |a> + <c| S1·S2 |b> + <c| S1·S2 |c>

So, that's 9 terms.

But given the symmetry, perhaps many of these cross terms vanish.

First, let's compute <a| S1·S2 |a>

But as we saw earlier, for |a> = |↑↑↓〉, S1·S2 |a> = (3/4) ħ² |a>?

Wait, no, hold on. |a> is |↑↑↓〉, but is this an eigenstate of S1·S2?

No, because S1·S2 includes S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y, which mix the states.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute <a| S1·S2 |a> directly.

Earlier, I tried to compute it and found it 3/4, but that was in the case of |↑↑〉, which is different.

Wait, in |↑↑↓〉, S1^z S2^z = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

What about S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y?

In the state |↑↑↓〉, S1^x |↑〉 = |↓〉 + |↑〉 over sqrt(2), similarly for S2^x.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓〉 = (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) ⊗ (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) |↓〉

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, S1^x acting on |↑〉 gives (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2), same for S2^x.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓〉 = [ (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) ] ⊗ [ (|↓〉 + |↑〉)/sqrt(2) ] |↓〉

= (1/2)[ |↓↓↓〉 + |↓↑↓〉 + |↑↓↓〉 + |↑↑↓〉 ]

Similarly for S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓〉, we have:

S1^y |↑〉 = i|↓〉, S2^y |↑〉 = i|↓〉, so S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓〉 = (i |↓〉) ⊗ (i |↓〉) |↓〉 = (-1)|↓↓↓〉

So, <a| S1·S2 |a> = <↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓| S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓>

From above, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓> = 1/4 |↑↑↓>

S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> gives (1/2)[ |↓↓↓〉 + |↓↑↓〉 + |↑↓↓〉 + |↑↑↓〉 ]

So, when taking the inner product with <↑↑↓|, only the last term survives, giving (1/2)*1 = 1/2

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> gives (-1)|↓↓↓〉, so the inner product is zero.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |a> = 1/4 + 1/2 + 0 = 3/4

Similarly, compute <b| S1·S2 |b> where |b> = |↑↓↑〉.

Similar to |a>, <b| S1·S2 |b> = 3/4

Same with <c| S1·S2 |c> = 3/4

Now, cross terms: <a| S1·S2 |b>

Compute <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑>

First, S1·S2 |↑↓↑〉 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ) |↑↓↑〉

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑〉 = (1/2)(-1/2) |↑↓↑〉 = (-1/4) |↑↓↑〉

S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑〉:

S1^x |↑〉 = |↓〉 + |↑〉 /sqrt(2)

S2^x |↓〉 = |↑〉 + |↓〉 /sqrt(2)

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I've been given this problem about spin 1/2 particles and a specific Hamiltonian. I need to figure out if the given state is an eigenfunction of H and, if it is, find its energy. If not, I have to find the expectation value of the energy. The answer is supposed to be an eigenstate with energy (2/3)Aħ², but I need to work through it step by step.

First, let me write down the Hamiltonian. It's given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. So, H is a sum of the dot products of each pair of spin operators.

The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ ). Each term in the sum has two spins up and one spin down, but each down is in a different position. So, it's a symmetric state under permutation of the particles, but not fully symmetric because each term has a different particle in the down state.

I need to check if psi is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, then H acting on psi should give me a multiple of psi; that multiple would be the eigenvalue, which is the energy.

To do this, I think I should compute H|psi⟩ and see if it's a scalar multiple of |psi⟩.

But H is a sum of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. So, perhaps I can compute each of these terms separately and then add them up.

First, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators S_i are given by S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So, S_i·S_j = (ħ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j). Therefore, each term like S1·S2 is a scalar multiple of the dot product of Pauli matrices.

But maybe instead of working with Pauli matrices directly, I can use the identity for spin operators: S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)² - (3/4)I. Wait, no, actually, the correct identity is S_i·S_j = (S_i² + S_j² + 2S_i·S_j)/2, but that might not be helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express S_i·S_j in terms of the total spin squared.

Wait, another approach: For two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - S1² - S2²). Since each S1 and S2 are spin-1/2, S1² = (3/4)ħ² and same for S2². So, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total² - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ²) = (1/2)(S_total² - (3/2)ħ²). So, S1·S2 = (S_total² - (3/2)ħ²)/2.

But wait, S_total² is the square of the total spin operator for the two particles, which can take values s(s+1)ħ², where s is the total spin. For two spin-1/2 particles, s can be 0 or 1. So, S_total² can be 0 or ħ²(0)(0+1) = 0 or ħ²(1)(2) = 2ħ².

But in our case, the state psi is a symmetric combination with two up spins and one down spin. Wait, actually, each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin, but each term is a different particle being down. So, in each term, the two up spins could be either same or different? Wait, let's write the state again: |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩, |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩, |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩.

So in each term, two particles are up, one is down. The state is symmetric under permutation of particles, which suggests that it's an eigenstate of the permutation group. Hmm, perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total²? Let me see.

The total spin squared operator is (S1 + S2 + S3)². Let me compute this:

(S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But from the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H is a part of this expression. Therefore, (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2H.

Given that, perhaps if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² for the state psi, I can relate it to H.

So, first, let's compute S1², S2², S3² acting on |psi⟩. Each S_i² is (3/4)ħ² times the identity operator because each particle is spin-1/2. So, S1²|psi⟩ = (3/4)ħ² |psi⟩, same for S2² and S3².

Therefore, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ħ² + 2H. So, S_total² = (9/4)ħ² + 2H.

Therefore, H = (S_total² - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² for |psi⟩, then I can find the eigenvalue of H.

So, let's compute S_total² |psi⟩. To do that, I need to figure out the eigenvalue of S_total² on |psi⟩.

But what is the total spin of the state |psi⟩? Is it a singlet, triplet, etc.?

Looking at |psi⟩: it's a symmetric state with two up spins and one down. Wait, no, each term is a specific configuration, but when considering permutations, it's symmetric. Let me see: swapping particles 1 and 2, etc., the state remains the same.

But is it an eigenstate of S_total²? Let's think.

Each term in |psi⟩ has two up spins and one down. The total spin can be computed for each term.

Wait, but each term is a product state, so when I apply S_total², it will act on each term.

Wait, maybe it's better to write |psi⟩ as a combination of total spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps |psi⟩ is symmetric under permutation, so it's an eigenstate of S_total². Let me check.

Wait, S_total² commutes with permutation operations only if the state is symmetric or antisymmetric. Since |psi⟩ is symmetric, S_total² should commute with the permutation operators, but I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total² on |psi⟩.

Since S_total² is (S1 + S2 + S3)², expanding this:

(S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

As above, which gives S_total² = (9/4)ħ² + 2H.

So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² on |psi⟩, then I can find the expectation value of H, which relates to the energy.

Alternatively, let me compute the expectation value of S_total² for |psi⟩. Since S_total² is the sum of squares plus twice the sum of dot products, maybe I can compute the total spin squared in another way.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total² by considering the expectation of each term.

But another idea: perhaps find the total spin of |psi⟩. If |psi⟩ is an eigenstate of S_total², then it's also an eigenstate of H.

But what's the possible total spin s for this state? Each term in |psi⟩ has two up spins and one down spin. So, each term is three spins, two up, one down.

Wait, but for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 1/2, 3/2, etc., but it depends on how the spins combine.

But |psi⟩ is a symmetric state with two up and one down. Let me think about the possible total spin states.

Wait, maybe I can write |psi⟩ in terms of total spin eigenstates.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's compute the expectation value of S_total² for |psi⟩, which might help.

So, the expectation value ⟨psi| S_total² |psi⟩.

As S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i² + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨psi| (sum S_i² + 2 sum S_i·S_j) |psi⟩.

We know each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so sum S_i² is (9/4)ħ².

So, ⟨S_total²⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2⟨psi| (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi⟩.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so ⟨H⟩ = A * ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2A * ⟨H⟩.

But if I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩ by considering how each term in |psi⟩ contributes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each S_i·S_j expectation value separately.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩.

But S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ - (3/4)ħ².

But (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i² + S_j² + 2 S_i·S_j, so substituting back, maybe it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of spin singlet and triplet states.

But wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S_total² = 0, and the triplet states have S_total² = 2ħ².

So, for two spins, S_i·S_j = [S_total² - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ²]/2 = (S_total² - (3/2)ħ²)/2.

Therefore, for each pair, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = [⟨S_total²⟩_{ij} - (3/2)ħ²]/2, where ⟨S_total²⟩_{ij} is the expectation value of S_i + S_j squared for the state |psi⟩.

But wait, in our case, the state |psi⟩ is a three-particle state, not a two-particle state. So, perhaps this approach isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value of each S_i·S_j for |psi⟩.

Let me consider ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Each term in |psi⟩ is a product state of three spins. So, for each term, I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, and then average over the three terms.

So, for |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩, S1 is up, S2 is up, S3 is down. Then, S1·S2 is (ħ/2)^2 times the identity matrix for each Pauli matrix.

Wait, no: S1·S2 is (ħ²/4)(σ₁·σ₂). So, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state |↑↑↓⟩ is (ħ²/4)⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩.

But for |↑↑↓⟩, what is ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩?

The state |↑↑↓⟩ is a product state, so σ₁·σ₂ acts on the first two particles. Since the third particle is in the down state, which doesn't affect the first two spins.

So, σ₁·σ₂ in this basis is the sum of σ₁_i σ₂_i for i = x, y, z.

In |↑↑↓⟩, σ₁_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, σ₂_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩. So, σ₁_z σ₂_z |↑↑⟩ = (+1)(+1)|↑↑⟩. Similarly, σ₁_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ₂_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so σ₁_x σ₂_x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩, which is not in the same state as |↑↑⟩, so the expectation value ⟨↑↑| σ₁_x σ₂_x |↑↑⟩ is zero. Similarly, ⟨↑↑| σ₁_y σ₂_y |↑↑⟩ is zero because σ_y acting on |↑⟩ flips it to |↓⟩, and the inner product ⟨↑↑|↓↓⟩ is zero.

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Actually, for the expectation value of σ₁·σ₂ in the state |↑↑⟩, which is a two-spin state, the expectation value is ⟨↑↑| σ₁·σ₂ |↑↑⟩.

But σ₁·σ₂ is σ_x⊗σ_x + σ_y⊗σ_y + σ_z⊗σ_z.

So, ⟨↑↑| σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↑⟩: σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩, and ⟨↑↑|↓↓⟩=0.

Similarly, ⟨↑↑| σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↑⟩=0, because σ_y|↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, so σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↑⟩ = i²|↓↓⟩ = -|↓↓⟩, and ⟨↑↑|↓↓⟩=0.

And ⟨↑↑| σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↑⟩ = (1)(1)⟨↑↑|↑↑⟩ = 1.

So, the expectation value of σ₁·σ₂ in |↑↑⟩ is 1.

Wait, but that seems contradictory because if two spins are both up, then σ_z⊗σ_z gives +1, but σ_x⊗σ_x and σ_y⊗σ_y give zero expectation.

So, the total expectation value is 1.

Therefore, ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = 1, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)*1 = ħ²/4.

But wait, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins are up, but the third spin is down. Does that affect the expectation value? I don't think so because S1·S2 acts only on the first two spins. So, in |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation of S1·S2 is still (ħ²/4)*1 = ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the state |↑↓↑⟩, the first and third spins are up, and the second is down. So, for S1·S3, we can compute its expectation value.

In |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

So, S1·S3 is (ħ²/4)⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩.

What's ⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩ in |↑↓⟩?

So, the first spin is up, the third spin is up, so σ_z⊗σ_z gives +1, and the inner product is 1. σ_x⊗σ_x acting on |↑↓⟩ would give |↓↑⟩, and σ_y⊗σ_y would give i|↓↑⟩ and -i|↑↓⟩, but since we're taking the expectation value, it's zero. So, similar to before, ⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩ = 1, so ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the state |↓↑↑⟩, compute ⟨S2·S3⟩. It's the same as ⟨S1·S2⟩ in |↑↑↓⟩, so it should also be ħ²/4.

Therefore, in each term of |psi⟩, the expectation value of each S_i·S_j is ħ²/4.

But wait, |psi⟩ is a symmetric combination of these three product states: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(3). So, when we compute the expectation value of S1·S2, for example, we need to compute the average of the expectation values in each term.

But wait, no. Because in |psi⟩, each term is orthogonal, so the expectation value of S1·S2 in |psi⟩ is the average of the expectation values in each term.

But actually, that's not correct. Wait, no, because S1·S2 is an operator that acts on all three spins, but in each term, it only acts on the first two spins.

Wait, no, in each term, it's a product state where the third spin is down. So, S1·S2 acts on the first two spins, which are up in that term, and the third spin is in a definite state, but S1·S2 doesn't affect it.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in each term is ħ²/4, as we computed. Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩_psi = (1/3)(⟨S1·S2⟩_1 + ⟨S1·S2⟩_2 + ⟨S1·S2⟩_3 ) = (1/3)(ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = (1/3)(3ħ²/4) = ħ²/4.

Similarly, ⟨S1·S3⟩_psi and ⟨S2·S3⟩_psi are each ħ²/4.

Therefore, H|psi⟩ = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi⟩ = A*(3*(ħ²/4))|psi⟩ = (3Aħ²/4)|psi⟩.

But wait, the answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ². Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j acting on |psi⟩, but |psi⟩ is a singlet state? Or maybe not.

Wait, let's think again. Each S_i·S_j is between two spins. When acting on |psi⟩, each S_i·S_j doesn't necessarily have the same expectation value as if the third spin were up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the expectation value in each term is the same. Let me recompute.

Let me compute ⟨psi| S1·S2 |psi⟩.

So, S1·S2 is (ħ²/4)(σ₁·σ₂). So, ⟨psi| σ₁·σ₂ |psi⟩ = (ħ²/4) ⟨psi| σ₁·σ₂ |psi⟩.

So, compute ⟨psi| σ₁·σ₂ |psi⟩.

But |psi⟩ is a sum of three product states. So, let's write |psi⟩ as:

|psi⟩ = ( |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ ) / sqrt(3).

Then, σ₁·σ₂ acts only on the first two spins. So, let's write each term:

⟨psi| σ₁·σ₂ |psi⟩ = (1/3) [ ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃| σ₁·σ₂ |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃| σ₁·σ₂ |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃| σ₁·σ₂ |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ + ... ].

Wait, actually, since σ₁·σ₂ is diagonal in the product basis, because σ₁·σ₂ |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩, and σ₁·σ₂ |↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, actually, σ₁·σ₂ is the dot product, which is not diagonal in the computational basis.

Wait, let me recall that σ·σ = σ_x σ_x + σ_y σ_y + σ_z σ_z. So, for two spins, the eigenvalues of σ·σ are 1, 0, and 1, corresponding to triplet and singlet states.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, σ·σ can have eigenvalues +1 (triplet) and -1 (singlet). But in the computational basis, |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩, what are the eigenvalues?

Actually, for each state, the eigenvalue is the sum of the products of the individual eigenvalues.

So, for |↑↑⟩, σ_x σ_x + σ_y σ_y + σ_z σ_z = (1)(1) + (0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2? Wait, no.

Wait, hold on. For two spins, σ_x and σ_y are anti-Hermitian, but their product is Hermitian. Wait, no, the sum is Hermitian.

But to find the expectation value in a given state, perhaps it's easier to compute it for each basis state.

So, let's compute ⟨↑↑| σ·σ |↑↑⟩. As I tried earlier, each term:

⟨↑↑| σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑| ↓↓⟩ = 0.
⟨↑↑| σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑| (i|↓⟩⊗(i|↓⟩)) = ⟨↑↑| (-|↓↓⟩) = 0.
⟨↑↑| σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↑⟩ = 1.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| σ·σ |↑↑⟩ = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↑↓| σ·σ |↑↓⟩:

Compute each component:

σ_x⊗σ_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩, so ⟨↑↓| ↓↑⟩ = 0.
σ_y⊗σ_y |↑↓⟩ = i|↓↑⟩, so ⟨↑↓| ↓↑⟩ = 0.
σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↓⟩ = -|↑↓⟩, so ⟨↑↓| σ_z⊗σ_z |↑↓⟩ = -1.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| σ·σ |↑↓⟩ = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1.

Similarly, ⟨↓↑| σ·σ |↓↑⟩ = same as ⟨↑↓| σ·σ |↑↓⟩, so -1.

And ⟨↓↓| σ·σ |↓↓⟩ = 1.

So, in each of the four possible two-spin states, the expectation value of σ·σ is 1 for |↑↑⟩ and |↓↓⟩, and -1 for |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩.

Therefore, going back to |psi⟩, which is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

So, compute ⟨psi| σ·σ |psi⟩.

Which is (1/3)(⟨↑↑↓| σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓| σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓| σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ + ... ).

But let's write it more carefully.

⟨psi| σ·σ |psi⟩ = (1/3) [ ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Now, let's evaluate each term:

1. ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩: In this state, the first two spins are up, so σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, so this term is 1.

2. ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩: Here, the first spin is up, the second spin is down, the third spin is up. So, the state is |↑↓↑⟩. Applying σ·σ to it: as before, σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩. So, the inner product ⟨↑↑↓|↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

3. ⟨↑↑↓|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩: The state is |↓↑↑⟩. Applying σ·σ: again, the first spin is down, second and third are up. So, σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩. The inner product ⟨↑↑↓|↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, moving to the next set:

4. ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩: The state is |↑↑↓⟩. σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, so inner product ⟨↑↓↑|↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

5. ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩: The state is |↑↓↑⟩. σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩, so inner product ⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ = (-1) * (-1) * 1? Wait, no: the inner product is ⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 1. But the state after σ·σ is -|↑↓↑⟩, so the inner product is (-1)*1 = -1.

Wait, no: ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (-1)|↑↓↑⟩ = (-1)*1 = -1.

6. ⟨↑↓↑|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩: The state is |↓↑↑⟩. Applying σ·σ: since the first spin is down, σ_z⊗σ_z gives (-1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩. So, the inner product ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Next set:

7. ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩: The state is |↑↑↓⟩. σ·σ |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, so inner product is 0.

8. ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩: The state is |↑↓↑⟩. σ·σ |↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩, so inner product is 0.

9. ⟨↓↑↑|σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩: The state is |↓↑↑⟩. σ·σ |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩, so inner product is ⟨↓↑↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 1, multiplied by (-1).

Putting all these together:

Term 1: 1

Terms 2,3,4,7: 0

Term 5: -1

Terms 6,8: 0

Term 9: -1

So, total sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Therefore, ⟨sigma·sigma⟩ = (-1)/3. So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)*(-1/3) = -ħ²/(12).

Wait, hold on. That seems different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in each term, the expectation value was 1, but that was incorrect, because when the third spin is in a different state, the expectation value is not 1 for the first two spins.

So, actually, when computing ⟨psi| sigma·sigma |psi⟩, we get -1/3, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)*(-1/3) = -ħ²/(12).

Similarly, what about ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩?

Wait, let's compute ⟨S1·S3⟩.

Similarly, for each term in |psi⟩, compute ⟨S1·S3⟩.

But let's proceed similarly as above.

Compute ⟨psi| sigma1·sigma3 |psi⟩.

So, sigma1·sigma3 is (sigma_x sigma_x + sigma_y sigma_y + sigma_z sigma_z) acting on the first and third spins.

We can compute this similarly. Let's break it down.

Compute the same nine terms:

1. ⟨↑↑↓|sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩: sigma_z sigma_z gives (1)(1)|↑↑↓⟩, so 1.

2. ⟨↑↑↓|sigma1·sigma3 |↑↓↑⟩: The state is |↑↓↑⟩. sigma_z sigma_z gives (1)(1)|↑↓↑⟩, so inner product is 1.

Wait, no: sigma1·sigma3 acts on the first and third spins.

So, in |↑↑↓⟩, first spin is up, third spin is down.

So, sigma_z sigma_z gives (1)(-1)|↑↑↓⟩ = -|↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, wait: no, sigma_z sigma_z for first and third spins:

In |↑↑↓⟩, first spin is up (so sigma_z gives +1), third spin is down (so sigma_z gives -1). So, sigma_z sigma_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↑↓⟩ = -|↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, sigma_x sigma_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩, and sigma_y sigma_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i|↓↑⟩)⊗(i|↓⟩) = i² |↓↑↓⟩ = -|↓↑↓⟩.

But for each term, we have:

1. ⟨↑↑↓| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (-|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↓⟩).

But ⟨↑↑↓|↓↓↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↑↓|↓↑↓⟩ = 0, so this term is -1.

2. ⟨↑↑↓| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↓↑⟩: |↑↓↑⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↑↓↑⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↑↓↑⟩ = i|↑↓↑⟩.

So, ⟨↑↑↓| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (-|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + i|↑↓↑⟩).

But ⟨↑↑↓|↑↓↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↑↓|↓↑↑⟩ = 0, so this term is 0.

3. ⟨↑↑↓| sigma1·sigma3 |↓↑↑⟩: |↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↓↑↑⟩ = (-i)|↑↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨↑↑↓| sigma1·sigma3 |↓↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| (-|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↑↑⟩ -i|↑↑↑⟩).

But ⟨↑↑↓|↑↑↑⟩ = 0, so this term is 0.

Similarly, terms 4,5,6,7,8,9:

4. ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩: |↑↑↓⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↑↓⟩ = -|↑↑↓⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↑↑↓⟩ = -|↓↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (-|↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↓⟩).

⟨↑↓↑|↑↑↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↓↑|↓↓↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↓⟩ = 0.

So, term 4: 0.

5. ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↓↑⟩: |↑↓↑⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↑↓↑⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↑↓↑⟩ = i|↑↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (-|↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + i|↑↑↑⟩).

But ⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ = -1, ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↓↑|↑↑↑⟩ = 0.

So, this term is (-1)*(-1) = 1.

6. ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↓↑↑⟩: |↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↓↑↑⟩ = (-i)|↑↑↑⟩.

So, ⟨↑↓↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↓↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| (-|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↑↑⟩ -i|↑↑↑⟩).

⟨↑↓↑|↑↑↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0, so this term is 0.

7. ⟨↓↑↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩: |↑↑↓⟩.

sigma_z sigma_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (+1)(-1)|↑↑↓⟩ = -|↑↑↓⟩.

sigma_x sigma_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

sigma_y sigma_y |↑↑↓⟩ = -|↓↑↓⟩.

So, ⟨↓↑↑| sigma1·sigma3 |↑↑↓⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| (-
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem here with three spin-1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state ψ is provided as 1/√3 times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what its energy is. If not, I need to find the expectation value of the energy.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have three spin-1/2 particles, each in a spin-up or spin-down state. The Hamiltonian involves the dot product of the spin operators for each pair of particles, multiplied by a constant A. So, H is a sum of three terms: S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3.

The state ψ is a symmetric combination of three states where two spins are up and one is down. Each term in the sum has one down spin in a different position. So, it's an equal superposition of the three possible states where exactly two are up and one is down. That should make the state symmetric under permutation of the particles, I think.

I need to check if ψ is an eigenstate of H. That means I need to compute Hψ and see if it's proportional to ψ. If Hψ = Eψ, then ψ is an eigenstate with energy E. If not, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩.

But before I dive into computations, maybe I can recall some properties of spin states and the spin operators. Spin operators S_i have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for each particle. Also, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Specifically, I remember that S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. This might help in simplifying the Hamiltonian.

So, let me rewrite H using this identity:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)
   = A*[(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2]

Let me compute that:

H = A*[ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 + S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2 + S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ]

Simplify the numerator:

= A*[ (3 S_total^2 - 2 S1^2 - 2 S2^2 - 2 S3^2 ) / 2 ]

But for spin-1/2 particles, each S_i^2 = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * ( (s(s+1)) ) where s=1/2. So, S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ^2 for each particle.

Therefore, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

Plugging back in:

H = A*[ (3 S_total^2 - 2*(3/4 ħ^2)*3 ) / 2 ]

Wait, hold on. Let me do this step by step.

First, compute 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) = 2*(3*(3/4) ħ^2) = 2*(9/4 ħ^2) = (9/2) ħ^2.

Wait, no, wait: in the numerator, it's 3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). So 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) = 2*(3*(3/4) ħ^2) = 2*(9/4 ħ^2) = 9/2 ħ^2.

Therefore, H becomes:

H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 9/2 ħ^2 ) / 2

Simplify:

H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

Wait, that seems off. Let me check my algebra.

Wait, starting over:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)
And S1·S2 = [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2]/2
Similarly for the others.

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2]/2 + [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2]/2 + [S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2

Adding these up:

= [ (3 S_total^2) - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

Therefore, H = A * [ (3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2 ]

Since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2,

Then S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4) ħ^2 = (9/4) ħ^2

So, substituting back:

H = A * [ (3 S_total^2 - 2*(9/4 ħ^2) ) / 2 ]
= A * [ (3 S_total^2 - (9/2) ħ^2 ) / 2 ]
= (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

Okay, so H is expressed in terms of S_total^2 and the identity term.

So, H is a combination of S_total squared and an identity term. That might be useful.

Now, let me think about the state ψ. It's a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Each term has two up spins and one down, but each down spin is in a different position.

So, ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, I think. Let me check.

Wait, S_total^2 is the total spin squared operator. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2. If the state ψ has total spin S, then S_total^2 ψ = S(S+1) ħ^2 ψ.

So, I need to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 in the state ψ.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩ for the state ψ.

Alternatively, maybe I can figure out the total spin of ψ.

Wait, ψ is a symmetric combination of three states where two are up and one is down. Let's see: for each term, two spins are up, one is down.

Wait, is the state symmetric under exchange of particles? Let me see. The state is up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3, multiplied by 1/√3.

Yes, it's symmetric because swapping any two particles will permute the terms, but since we're summing over all such permutations, the state is symmetric.

Therefore, ψ is a symmetric state.

Also, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states with two up and one down: I think that the state with two up and one down can have either total spin S = 1/2 or S = 3/2, depending on whether the down spins are in the same state or not.

Wait, no, in our case, each term has exactly two up spins. So, the state is symmetric under particle exchange, but it has one down in each term, but in different positions.

Wait, that might not directly tell me the total spin.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ and see if it's an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H, which is the same as the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Because the total energy is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, maybe I can compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩, ⟨ψ|S1·S3|ψ⟩, and ⟨ψ|S2·S3|ψ⟩, and sum them up, then multiply by A.

But perhaps even smarter: compute the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. Since the state is symmetric, the expectation values ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩ should all be equal. So, if I compute one, I can multiply by 3.

So, let me compute, say, ⟨S1·S2⟩.

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)

Wait, but since we can't compute S_total^2 for the state ψ yet, unless we know what S_total^2 is.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ directly.

Alternatively, compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ as the sum over the states in ψ.

But since ψ is a symmetric combination, maybe I can compute the expectation value for one term and then multiply appropriately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that each term in ψ has two up spins and one down spin.

So, for each term, say, up1 up2 down3, when I compute ⟨up1 up2 down3 | S1·S2 | up1 up2 down3⟩, what is that? Wait, but S1·S2 acts on the spin of particles 1 and 2.

In the state up1 up2 down3, the spins of particles 1 and 2 are both up. The operator S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, in the state up1 up2 down3, S1^z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, and same for S2^z. So, S1^z S2^z acting on up1 up2 down3 would give (ħ/2)^2 down3? No, wait, S1^z and S2^z act on particles 1 and 2, so the state down3 is unaffected. So, S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = (ħ/2)^2 |up1 up2 down3>.

Similarly, S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y acting on |up1 up2 down3> would give us transitions. But wait, S1^x and S2^x acting on |up1 up2 down3> would flip the spin of particles 1 and 2. Let's think:

S1^x and S2^x. So, S1^x |up1> = (ħ/2)|down1>, and S2^x |up2> = (ħ/2)|down2>. So, S1^x S2^x |up1 up2 down3> = (ħ/2)^2 |down1 down2 down3>.

Similarly, S1^y and S2^y would also flip the spin, but with a complex phase. But since in the state ψ, all the terms are real, perhaps when computing expectation values, the cross terms might not contribute? Or maybe I can think in terms of singlet and triplet states.

Wait, perhaps it's useful to express the state ψ in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, for two spins, the singlet state is (|↑↓> - |↓↑>)/√2, which is antisymmetric, and the triplet states are symmetric: (|↑↑>, (|↑↓> + |↓↑>)/√2, |↓↓>).

But in our case, we have three spins, so it's a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for the state ψ.

Since ψ is a symmetric state, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ can be found by looking at the expectation value of S1·S2 in each term and then combining them.

So, let me denote the three terms as |a>, |b>, |c>, where:

|a> = |↑1 ↑2 ↓3>
|b> = |↑1 ↓2 ↑3>
|c> = |↓1 ↑2 ↑3>

So, ψ = (|a> + |b> + |c>)/√3.

Compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

Which is (1/3) [⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|] S1·S2 [ |a> + |b> + |c> ]

So, this becomes (1/3)[ ⟨a|S1·S2|a> + ⟨a|S1·S2|b> + ⟨a|S1·S2|c> + ⟨b|S1·S2|a> + ... etc. ]

Since S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, the action on particles 3 is trivial (i.e., leaves them as they are). So, in the expectation values, when we have ⟨a|S1·S2|b>, for example, the state |b> is |↑1 ↓2 ↑3>. So, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, and leaves particle 3 untouched.

Therefore, ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩ = ⟨↑1 ↑2 ↓3| S1·S2 |↑1 ↓2 ↑3⟩.

Similarly, all other cross terms will involve S1·S2 acting on the first two spins.

So, let's compute each term.

First, compute ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩:

In |a>, particles 1 and 2 are both up. So, S1·S2 acting on |a> will be:

(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |a>

As I thought earlier, S1^z S2^z |a> = (ħ/2)^2 |a>. For S1^x S2^x, it flips both spins:

S1^x S2^x |a> = (ħ/2)^2 |down1 down2 down3>.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |a> = (ħ/2)^2 |down1 down2 down3>, but with a factor of i? Wait, no, S^y is (S^x - i S^z)/2 or something? Maybe I need to recall the exact form.

Wait, actually, the spin matrices for S^x, S^y, S^z are known. For spin-1/2 particles:

S^x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
S^y = (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]
S^z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, S^x applied to |↑> is (ħ/2)|↓>, and S^y applied to |↑> is (-i ħ/2)|↓>, and similarly for the other spin.

Therefore, S1^x S2^x |↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓>, and S1^y S2^y |↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓> with a factor of -i^2, which is -1, because S1^y S2^y acting on |↑↑> would be (ħ/2)^2 * (-i)^2 |↓↓> = (ħ/2)^2 (-1) |↓↓>.

Wait, actually, let me compute S1^y S2^y |↑↑>:

S1^y |↑> = (-i)(ħ/2)|↓>
S2^y |↑> = (-i)(ħ/2)|↓>
So, S1^y S2^y |↑↑> = (-i)(ħ/2)|↓> ⊗ (-i)(ħ/2)|↓> = (i^2)(ħ^2/4)|↓↓> = (-1)(ħ^2/4)|↓↓>

So, yes, S1^y S2^y |↑↑> = -(ħ^2/4)|↓↓>

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↓>

So, S1·S2 |↑↑> = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4 + (-ħ^2/4) + (ħ^2/4)) |↓↓> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↓>

Wait, wait, hold on:

Wait, S1^x S2^x |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↓>
S1^y S2^y |↑↑> = -(ħ^2/4)|↓↓>
S1^z S2^z |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑>

So, adding them up:

(ħ^2/4)|↓↓> + (-ħ^2/4)|↓↓> + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑> = 0 + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑>

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, that would mean that S1·S2 |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑>

But I thought that S_i·S_j for two spins in the same state (both up) would be positive. But in reality, for two spins up, the expectation value of S1·S2 is ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) - (1/2)^2 ) * ħ^2? Wait, maybe I need to think about the expectation value.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles in the triplet state |↑↑>, the expectation value of S1·S2 is:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↑↑⟩

As I computed above, this gives (ħ^2/4)|↑↑⟩. So, the expectation value is ħ^2/4.

Wait, but I thought for two spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the triplet state is (1/2 - 3/4) times something?

Wait, let me recall that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2). So, if |↑↑> is the triplet state with S_total = 1, then S_total^2 |↑↑> = ħ^2 |↑↑>, so:

S1·S2 |↑↑> = (1/2)(ħ^2 - (3/4)ħ^2 - (3/4)ħ^2) |↑↑> = (1/2)(ħ^2 - 9/8 ħ^2) |↑↑> = (1/2)(-7/8 ħ^2) |↑↑> = (-7/16) ħ^2 |↑↑>

Wait, but that conflicts with my earlier computation.

Wait, let me be precise. Let's compute ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩.

From S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2,

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = [⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩]/2

For |↑↑>, S_total^2 is 1(1+1)ħ^2 = 2ħ^2 (since S=1)

Wait, no. For two spin-1/2 particles, if they are in the triplet state (total spin S=1), S_total^2 |↑↑> = S(S+1)ħ^2 |↑↑> = 2ħ^2 |↑↑>

So, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 2ħ^2

⟨S1^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ^2, same for S2^2.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = [2ħ^2 - (3/4 + 3/4) ħ^2]/2 = [2ħ^2 - (3/2) ħ^2]/2 = [ (4/2 - 3/2) ħ^2 ] /2 = (1/2 ħ^2)/2 = (1/4) ħ^2

So, yes, ⟨S1·S2⟩ in the |↑↑> state is ħ^2/4, which matches my earlier computation.

Wait, but in my initial computation, I have:

S1·S2 |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↓↓>

But |↑↑> and |↓↓> are orthogonal, so when I project back, only |↑↑> remains?

Wait, no, because S1·S2 |↑↑> is a combination of |↑↑> and |↓↓>. So, if I compute the expectation value ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩, it should be the coefficient of |↑↑> in S1·S2 |↑↑>.

So, from S1·S2 |↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↓↓>, so the expectation value ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ is (ħ^2/4) * ⟨↑↑|↑↑⟩ + (-ħ^2/4) ⟨↑↑|↓↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4)*1 + 0 = ħ^2/4, which is consistent.

Okay, so that's good.

Therefore, going back, ⟨a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = ⟨↑1 ↑2 ↓3 | S1·S2 |↑1 ↑2 ↓3⟩

But S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so |a> is |↑↑↓>

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = ħ^2/4 |↑↑↓> - ħ^2/4 |↓↓↓>

Therefore, ⟨a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = ħ^2/4 * ⟨↑↑↓|↑↑↓⟩ + (- ħ^2/4) ⟨↑↑↓|↓↓↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4)*1 + 0 = ħ^2/4.

Similarly, ⟨b| S1·S2 |b⟩ and ⟨c| S1·S2 |c⟩ would also be ħ^2/4 each, because the structure is the same.

Now, what about the cross terms? Like ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩.

So, ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓ | S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩

So, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↓↑>:

Again, S1·S2 = S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z

So, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) |↑↓↑>

S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↑>

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑> = (ħ/2)^2 (-i)^2 |↓↑↑> = (-1)(ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↑>

So, putting it together:

S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↓↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>
= (ħ^2/4)|↑↓↑> - (ħ^2/2)|↓↑↑>

Therefore, ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓ | [ (ħ^2/4)|↑↓↑> - (ħ^2/2)|↓↑↑> ]

But ⟨↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0, because the first spin is up, second is up, third is down in |↑↑↓>, and in |↑↓↑> the first spin is up, second is down, third is up. So, they are orthogonal.

Similarly, ⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0, because the first spin is up in |↑↑↓>, but in |↓↑↑> it's down.

Therefore, ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩. Let me compute that.

|c> is |↓↑↑>

So, S1·S2 |c> = S1·S2 |↓↑↑>

Which is (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↑↓↑>

So, ⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓ | [ (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> + (-ħ^2/4)|↑↓↑> ]

Again, ⟨↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑> = 0, ⟨↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑> = 0, so ⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩ and ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩ would also be zero, because when you act on |a> or |c>, you get terms orthogonal to |b>.

Wait, let me check ⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩.

|a> is |↑↑↓>, |b> is |↑↓↑>

So, ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

This is the same as ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is ⟨↑↓↑ | [ (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓> - (ħ^2/2)|↓↑↑> ]

So, the first term is (ħ^2/4) ⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↑↓⟩ = 0

The second term is (-ħ^2/2) ⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = (-ħ^2/2) * 0 = 0

So, yes, ⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩:

|c> is |↓↑↑>

So, S1·S2 |c> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> - (ħ^2/2)|↑↓↑>

Therefore, ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = ⟨↑↓↑ | [ (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> - (ħ^2/2)|↑↓↑> ]

Compute each term:

⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0

⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 1 (since both are |↑↓↑⟩. Wait, no: |↑↓↑> is |↑↓↑>, and ⟨↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 1. Wait, but S1·S2 |c> has a term - (ħ^2/2)|↑↓↑>?

Wait, no:

Wait, S1·S2 |c> = [ (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↑> + (-i ħ/2)^2 |↑↓↑> ] - [ (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓↑> + similar terms? Wait, maybe I confused it earlier.

Wait, no, S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)|↓↑↑>

S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = ( - ħ/2 )^2 |↓↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>

S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑>

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑↑> with a factor of (-i)^2 = -1.

So, S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> = - (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑>

Therefore, S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑> - (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑>

Simplify:

= (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> + [ (ħ^2/4) - (ħ^2/4) ] |↑↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>

So, S1·S2 |c> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>

Therefore, ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑ | (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> = (ħ^2/4) * 0 = 0

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, so maybe my mistake earlier was in the computation of S1·S2 |c>.

Wait, let's be precise.

For |c> = |↓↑↑>

Compute S1·S2 |c>:

= S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> + S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> + S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑>

Compute each term:

S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑↑>

S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> = ( -i ħ/2 )^2 |↑↑↑> = (-i)^2 (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑> = (-1)(ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑>

S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑> = ( - ħ/2 )^2 |↓↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>

Therefore, S1·S2 |c> = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑> - (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↑> + (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> = (0)|↑↑↑> + (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> = (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑>

Therefore, ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑ | S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = ⟨↑↓↑ | (ħ^2/4)|↓↑↑> = 0.

Wait, because ⟨↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑> = 0? No, wait, |b> is |↑↓↑> and |c> is |↓↑↑>. So, they are different states.

Therefore, ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨c| S1·S2 |a⟩ and ⟨c| S1·S2 |b⟩ would be 0.

So, in summary, when I compute the expectation value for ψ:

⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩ = (1/3)[ ⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c| ] S1·S2 [ |a> + |b> + |c> ]

Which gives:

(1/3)[ ⟨a|S1·S2|a> + ⟨a|S1·S2|b> + ⟨a|S1·S2|c> + ⟨b|S1·S2|a> + ⟨b|S1·S2|b> + ⟨b|S1·S2|c> + ⟨c|S1·S2|a> + ⟨c|S1·S2|b> + ⟨c|S1·S2|c> ]

As we found, the diagonal terms (like ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩) are each ħ^2/4, and the cross terms (⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩, etc.) are zero.

So, that's:

(1/3)[ (ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) ] = (1/3)(3*(ħ^2/4)) = (1/3)(3ħ^2/4) = ħ^2/4

Similarly, ⟨ψ| S1·S3 |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| S2·S3 |ψ⟩ would be the same, because the state is symmetric with respect to all three spins.

So, each of these three terms contributes ħ^2/4, so total expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩) = A*(3*(ħ^2/4)) = (3A/4) ħ^2

But wait, hold on. Earlier, when I expressed H in terms of S_total^2, I had:

H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

So, if I can compute S_total^2 for the state ψ, then I can relate it back.

But in any case, according to the calculation above, the expectation value of H is (3A/4) ħ^2. But the correct answer is given as 2/3 A ħ^2.

Wait, that suggests a discrepancy. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I computed ⟨S1·S2⟩ for ψ, I found it to be ħ^2/4. So, then, with three terms, ⟨H⟩ = 3*(A)*(ħ^2/4) = (3A/4) ħ^2.

But according to the correct answer, it should be (2/3) A ħ^2.

So, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation of ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Wait, let me double-check that step.

Compute ⟨ψ| S1·S2 |ψ⟩.

Which is (1/3)[⟨a| S1·S2 |a⟩ + ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩ + ⟨a| S1·S2 |c⟩ + ⟨b| S1·S2 |a⟩ + ⟨b| S1·S2 |b⟩ + ⟨b| S1·S2 |c⟩
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what the energy eigenvalue is. If not, what the expectation value is.

First, I remember that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are for the particles, each being spin 1/2. The Hamiltonian is a sum of dot products between each pair of spins, which suggests it might be related to the exchange interaction energy. So H is proportional to the sum of the spin-spin interactions between each pair.

I need to check if psi is an eigenstate of H. To do this, I can compute H psi and see if it's proportional to psi. If it is, then psi is an eigenstate, otherwise, it's not. The given correct answer is that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)A*hbar², but I need to work through it.

Let me write down the state again:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

This is symmetric under permutations of the particles. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. So it's a symmetric state with two up and one down. Wait, actually, each term is a permutation where each particle is up once and down once, no, wait. Wait, each term is two ups and one down. So each term is two spins up and one spin down. So the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles.

So, this is a state with two spins up and one spin down. Since all the permutations are included, it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator, S^2. Because the total spin can only take values 0 or 1 for three spin 1/2 particles. Since this state has two up spins and one down, the total spin S would be 1. So S^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>. That’s because for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 0 and 1. To get S=1, each permutation is a m_s = +1/2 state. But wait, in this state, each term is two ups and one down, which corresponds to m_s = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So the total m_s is 1/2, which is only possible if S=1.

So, S^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>, so |psi> is an eigenstate of S^2 with eigenvalue \hbar².

But the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Let me note that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be rewritten in terms of the total spin.

I remember that:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²)

So, since each S_i is spin 1/2, S1² = S2² = S3² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)\hbar² = (3/4)\hbar².

So, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)\hbar² = (9/4)\hbar².

Hence, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (9/4)\hbar².

So H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)\hbar² )

Since |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue \hbar², then H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - 9/4\hbar² ) |psi> = A*( -5/4 \hbar² ) |psi>.

Wait, but that contradicts the given answer of 2/3 A hbar². Hmm, so maybe my calculation is wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, no. Because H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So if I write S_total^2 as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²).

Which is correct.

So, then H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) )

Since |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, so H |psi> = A*(E_total^2 - (9/4 \hbar²)) |psi>, because S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4 \hbar²) as each is 3/4.

Wait, but in this case, E_total^2 is \hbar² for |psi>. So H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - (9/4)\hbar² ) |psi> = A*( -5/4 \hbar² ) |psi>.

But that can't be right because the given answer is positive 2/3 A hbar². So perhaps I have an error.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the expectation value of H instead. Wait, but if |psi> is an eigenstate, then expectation value is just the eigenvalue.

Wait, but let's double-check the total spin. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=1 and S=0.

To determine whether |psi> is S=1 or S=0.

Given that |psi> is symmetric under permutation, and each term has two up and one down.

Let me think, for S=1, the possible m_s values are -1, 0, +1. For S=0, m_s is 0 only.

In the state |psi>, each term has two spins up and one down. So, each term has m_s = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, m_s is the sum of the individual m_s. Each spin is either up or down, which corresponds to m_s=1/2 or -1/2.

So, in each term, for |↑↑↓⟩, m_s = (1/2) + (1/2) + (-1/2) = 1/2.

Similarly for the other terms. So the total m_s is 1/2, so S=1 because m_s can be 1/2 only for S=1.

Therefore, S^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>, correct.

Therefore, H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - (9/4) \hbar² ) |psi> = A*( -5/4 \hbar² ) |psi>.

But in the question, the correct answer is 2/3 A hbar².

Wait, that suggests either I have a miscalculation or maybe the state is not an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but I thought |psi> is symmetric and an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, but let me check if H is only a function of S_total^2 or not.

Wait, H is a function of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is indeed (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²).

So, yeah, H is a function of S_total^2. So if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, it should be an eigenstate of H.

But then why does the given answer say 2/3 A hbar² instead of -5/4 A hbar²?

Wait, maybe I need to compute H |psi> in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute H in terms of the total spin and then see.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total^2 - S1² - S2² - S3²)

So, as above.

So, if S_total^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>, and each S_i² |psi> = (3/4 \hbar²) |psi>.

So, then H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - 3*(3/4 \hbar²) ) |psi> = A*( \hbar² - (9/4 \hbar²) ) |psi> = A*(-5/4 \hbar²)|psi>.

But that would give a negative energy, but spin interactions are usually attractive. Wait, but the given answer is positive.

Wait, perhaps the state is not an eigenstate because H and S_total^2 may not commute? But wait, in this case, H is built from S_total^2, so they should commute.

Wait, no, H is a function of S_total^2, so they should commute, so if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, it should be an eigenstate of H.

Hmm, but then why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in thinking that |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2. Let me verify.

Wait, the state |psi> is symmetric under permutation, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation are either spin 0 or spin 1. Since each term in |psi> has two ups and one down, which is m_s=1/2, so S=1.

But maybe I need to compute S_total^2 acting on |psi> explicitly to confirm.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) |psi> + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi>.

But since H |psi> = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi>,

So, S_total^2 |psi> = (9/4 \hbar²)|psi> + 2*(H/A)|psi>.

But since |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, so S_total^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>,

Therefore:

\hbar² |psi> = (9/4 \hbar²)|psi> + 2*(H/A)|psi>

Therefore, ( \hbar² - 9/4 \hbar² ) |psi> = 2*(H/A)|psi>

Which is:

(-5/4 \hbar²)|psi> = 2*(H/A)|psi>

Therefore, H |psi> = (-5/8 A \hbar²)|psi>.

Wait, that's even worse. So H |psi> is proportional to |psi>, but with a negative coefficient.

But the correct answer is supposed to be positive 2/3 A hbar².

Wait, maybe my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, let's try a different approach.

Maybe compute the expectation value of H starting from |psi>.

So, if |psi> is not an eigenstate, then the expectation value is <psi|H|psi> = A*<psi|S1·S2 |psi> + A*<psi|S1·S3 |psi> + A*<psi|S2·S3 |psi>.

Since the state is symmetric, perhaps the expectation values for each pair are the same.

So, let me compute <S1·S2>.

I know that for two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

Similarly, S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 / 2 - (3/4) \hbar².

Therefore, <S1·S2> = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > / 2 - 3/4 \hbar² ].

Compute < (S1 + S2)^2 >.

Since for each term in |psi>, the state is |↑↑↓⟩, etc. Let me compute < (S1 + S2)^2 > for |psi>.

Each term in |psi> is a state with two ups and one down.

In each term, for example, |↑↑↓⟩:

Compute (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + 2 S1·S2 + S2^2.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of each component.

Alternatively, since we know that for each pair, S1·S2 has expectation value, maybe I can compute it.

Wait, but for each term in |psi>, the spins are |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

So for each term, for the first term |↑↑↓⟩, the spins are up, up, down.

So, compute S1·S2 for this term: S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) \hbar² * |↑↑⟩⟨↑↑⟩ + ... Wait, no.

Wait, for each spin operator, S_i has eigenvalues ±\hbar/2. So, S1·S2 is (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

So, for a given term, say |↑↑↓⟩, S1 and S2 are both up, S3 is down.

So, compute S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

= ( ( \hbar/2 ) ( \hbar/2 ) + 0 + 0 ) |↑↑↓⟩

= ( \hbar²/4 ) |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

Compute S1·S2:

= ( \hbar/2 * (-\hbar/2) ) (state where first two spins flip? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, S1·S2 is (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

For |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

So, S1·S2 = (S1_z S2_z) + (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y).

S1_z S2_z = ( \hbar/2 ) ( -\hbar/2 ) = - \hbar²/4.

For S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y, these will be the terms that flip spins.

Wait, actually, to compute S1·S2 for |↑↓↑⟩, using the fact that S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2.

So, S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/4 \hbar² - 3/4 \hbar² ] / 2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 \hbar² ] / 2.

But in the state |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

So, the total spin of S1 and S2 is S1 + S2. For |↑↓⟩, the total spin can be 0 or 1.

But |↑↓⟩ can be written as a combination of singlet and triplet states.

Specifically, |↑↓⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) * triplet state with m=0, plus (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) * singlet state.

But since we are in the state |↑↓↑⟩, the total state is |↑↓↑⟩, which is a product state, but perhaps it's better to compute <↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Alternatively, maybe compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

Wait, let's note that for a pair of spins, the expectation value of S1·S2 is given by:

< S1·S2 > = (1/2)( ( <S1_z S2_z> + <S1_x S2_x> + <S1_y S2_y> ) )

But for a product state |↑↓⟩, <S1_z S2_z> = (1/2)( -1/2 ) = -1/4.

For <S1_x S2_x>, since S_x is the spin flip operator, <↑↓| S_x |↑↓> would be zero because S_x flips the spin of S1 and S2. But in |↑↓⟩, flipping S1 and S2 would give |↓↑⟩, which is orthogonal to |↑↓⟩. So <↑↓| S1_x S2_x |↑↓> = 0.

Similarly, <S1_y S2_y> = 0, because S_y is a Hermitian operator, but in the state |↑↓>, the expectation is zero.

Therefore, for |↑↓↑⟩, < S1·S2 > = (-1/4) * \hbar².

Wait, but in the product state |↑↓↑⟩, the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, so their expectation is -1/4 \hbar².

Similarly, in |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins are |↑↑⟩, so S1·S2 expectation is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \hbar².

Wait, no. Because in |↑↑↓⟩, S1 and S2 are both up, so S1_z S2_z is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Similarly, S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y will have zero expectation because they flip spins, which are not present here.

Wait, but actually, S1·S2 is a scalar product, so in the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2) + 0 + 0 = 1/4 \hbar².

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S2 = (-1/4) \hbar².

And same for |↓↑↑⟩, S1·S2 would be (-1/4) \hbar², because S1 is down and S2 is up.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, no.

Wait, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, so S1_z S2_z = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

But S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y would have some expectation? Or not?

Wait, no, because S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ would be |↓↑↑⟩, which is not in the state, so the expectation is zero.

Similarly, same for S1_y S2_y.

Therefore, yes, in the state |↑↓↑⟩, < S1·S2 > = -1/4 \hbar².

So, for each term in |psi>, < S1·S2 > is 1/4 \hbar² for |↑↑↓⟩, and -1/4 \hbar² for |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, the average < S1·S2 > is [1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)] * \hbar² multiplied by 1/3.

Wait, because in |psi>, each term is 1/sqrt(3), and there are three terms.

So, compute < S1·S2 > = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ + <↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, first term is 1/4 \hbar², the other two terms are -1/4 \hbar² each.

Therefore, total expectation is (1/3)(1/4 -1/4 -1/4) \hbar² = (1/3)( -1/4 ) \hbar² = -1/12 \hbar².

Wait, that can't be right because I think I have a mistake here.

Wait, in the state |psi>, each term is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

So, < S1·S2 > is computed as:

1/3 [ <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + <↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ + <↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Which is 1/3 [ (1/4 \hbar²) + (-1/4 \hbar²) + (-1/4 \hbar²) ] = 1/3 [ -1/4 \hbar² ] = -1/12 \hbar².

Wait, that's the expectation for S1·S2.

Similarly, by symmetry, < S1·S3 > and < S2·S3 > are the same.

Therefore, < S1·S3 > = -1/12 \hbar², same for < S2·S3 >.

Therefore, the total expectation of H is A*( -1/12 \hbar² -1/12 \hbar² -1/12 \hbar² ) = A*(-1/4 \hbar²).

Wait, that's negative, but the given answer is positive 2/3 A \hbar².

Hmm, conflicting results.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in computing the expectation of S1·S2.

Wait, another approach: use the identity for S1·S2 = 1/4 (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/4 \hbar².

So, < S1·S2 > = 1/4 < (S1 + S2)^2 > - 3/4 \hbar².

Compute < (S1 + S2)^2 > = < S1^2 + 2 S1·S2 + S2^2 > = < S1^2 > + < S2^2 > + 2 < S1·S2 >.

But we can compute < S1^2 > and < S2^2 >.

But in |psi>, since each S_i is spin 1/2, < S1^2 > = 3/4 \hbar² for each particle.

Therefore, < (S1 + S2)^2 > = 3/4 \hbar² + 3/4 \hbar² + 2 < S1·S2 >.

Therefore, < (S1 + S2)^2 > = 3/2 \hbar² + 2 < S1·S2 >.

But < S1·S2 > = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > - 3/2 \hbar² ] / 2.

So,

< S1·S2 > = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > - 3/2 \hbar² ] / 2

But from above, < (S1 + S2)^2 > = 3/2 \hbar² + 2 < S1·S2 >.

Therefore,

Substitute into the previous equation:

< S1·S2 > = [ (3/2 \hbar² + 2 < S1·S2 > ) - 3/2 \hbar² ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ 3/2 \hbar² + 2 < S1·S2 > - 3/2 \hbar² ] / 2

= [ 2 < S1·S2 > ] / 2

= < S1·S2 >.

Wait, that's a tautology, which means this method doesn't help. Maybe need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps express the spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices.

So, S_i = ( \hbar / 2 ) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Then S1·S2 = ( \hbar² / 4 ) (σ1·σ2 )

Similarly, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 for each term.

In the term |↑↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1, so expectation is 1.

But wait, in terms of spin-1/2, σ·σ = 3 for triplet states, and -1 for singlet.

Wait, yes, for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state has σ·σ = -3, and triplet states have σ·σ = 1.

Therefore, |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet state, so for |↑↑↓⟩, considering the first two spins, it's part of the triplet, so σ1·σ2 expectation is +1.

But wait, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins are |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet state. So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is 1.

But actually, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, only the first two spins are |↑↑⟩, so the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is 1.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, the first two spins are |↑↓⟩, which is part of the singlet state, so the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is -1.

Wait, no. Wait, |↑↓⟩ is part of the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, |↑↓⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) * triplet state, plus (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2) * singlet state.

Therefore, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in |↑↓⟩ is [1 + (-3)] / 2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

Wait, no. Wait, <↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓> = [ <↑↓| (σ1 + σ2)^2 - σ1^2 - σ2^2 |↑↓> ] / 2.

But (σ1 + σ2)^2 = σ1^2 + 2σ1·σ2 + σ2^2.

So, < σ1·σ2 > = [ < (σ1 + σ2)^2 > - < σ1^2 > - < σ2^2 > ] / 2.

But < (σ1 + σ2)^2 > = <σ1^2> + 2 <σ1·σ2> + <σ2^2>.

Wait, but in |↑↓⟩, which is a singlet and triplet mixture.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the fact that for two spin 1/2 particles:

<σ1·σ2> = <S1·S2> * (4/ \hbar²) since S_i = \hbar/2 σ_i.

But earlier, I found that in |↑↑↓⟩, the first two spins have S1·S2 expectation of (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \hbar².

Wait, but in |↑↑⟩, the expectation of σ1·σ2 is 1, so that would correspond to S1·S2 expectation of 1 * ( \hbar²/4 ) = \hbar²/4.

Similarly, in |↑↓⟩, the expectation of σ1·σ2 is -1, so S1·S2 expectation is -\hbar²/4.

Therefore, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 expectation is \hbar²/4, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S2 expectation is -\hbar²/4, same for |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, going back, the expectation value of H is:

A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

Since each pair contributes the same:

Each <S1·S2> = (1/3) [ (1/4 \hbar²) + (-1/4 \hbar²) + (-1/4 \hbar²) ) ].

Wait, no, I think I messed up.

Wait, in |psi>, each term is one of the three terms: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Each term is 1/sqrt(3), so to compute < S1·S2 >, which is the same for each pair.

So, for each term in |psi>, we can compute < S1·S2 >.

For |↑↑↓⟩: S1 and S2 are up, so <S1·S2> = (1/2)(1/2) \hbar² = 1/4 \hbar².

For |↑↓↑⟩: S1 is up, S2 is down, so <S1·S2> = (1/2)(-1/2) \hbar² = -1/4 \hbar².

Similarly for |↓↑↑⟩: S1 is down, S2 is up, so <S1·S2> = (-1/2)(1/2) \hbar² = -1/4 \hbar².

Therefore, in the state |psi>, the average <S1·S2> is:

(1/3)[1/4 \hbar² + (-1/4) \hbar² + (-1/4) \hbar²] = (1/3)(-1/4) \hbar² = -1/12 \hbar².

Similarly, the same applies for < S1·S3 > and < S2·S3 >.

Therefore, <H> = A*( -1/12 \hbar² -1/12 \hbar² -1/12 \hbar² ) = A*(-1/4) \hbar².

But the given correct answer is 2/3 A hbar².

Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

We have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We have |psi> is symmetric, two up spins and one down.

I can think of |psi> as part of the symmetric subspace. Let me find the eigenvalues of H in this subspace.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the spin states can be partitioned into singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1) states.

Our |psi> is a triplet state.

So, for triplet states, the eigenvalues of S_total^2 are \hbar².

Then, H can be written as A*( S_total^2 - (9/4) \hbar² )

Thus, H = A*( S_total^2 - (9/4) \hbar² )

So, acting on |psi>, since it's a triplet state, S_total^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>

Therefore, H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - 9/4 \hbar² ) |psi> = A*( -5/4 \hbar² ) |psi> .

But the given answer is positive 2/3 A hbar².

Alternatively, maybe I got the expression for H wrong.

Wait, let me double-check.

I had H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But in 3D space, for three spins, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3² )

Which is correct.

So, H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (3*(3/4) \hbar² ) )

Thus, H = A*( S_total^2 - (9/4) \hbar² )

Therefore, for |psi> being a triplet state, S_total^2 |psi> = \hbar² |psi>, so H |psi> = A*( \hbar² - 9/4 \hbar² ) |psi> = (-5/4 A) \hbar² |psi>

But this is negative, conflicting with the correct answer.

Wait, the given answer is 2/3 A \hbar², which is positive. Therefore, my conclusion must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), but perhaps in a different convention.

Wait, perhaps in some textbooks, the interaction is written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), but when computing the eigenvalue, it's positive.

Wait, but if so, then for triplet states, the eigenvalue would be positive.

Wait, but according to the calculation, H |psi> is negative.

Hmm.

Wait, let me check the expectation value again.

So, the expectation value is < H > = A*( < S1·S2 > + < S1·S3 > + < S2·S3 > )

I computed each < S1·S2 > as -1/12 \hbar², same for others, so total expectation is -1/4 \hbar² A.

But according to the given answer, it's 2/3 A \hbar².

Wait, maybe the state is not an eigenstate. Maybe it's a combination of eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is not an eigenstate of H, but an eigenstate of S_total^2. So, perhaps H is not diagonal in the S_total^2 basis, but in the basis of total spin and its z-component.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for eigenstates of H. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that in the subspace of triplet states (S=1), the eigenvalues of S_total^2 are fixed, but H also has a different eigenvalue.

Wait, considering that for triplet states, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total)^2 - (9/4) \hbar².

So, S_total^2 is an operator with eigenvalue \hbar² for triplet states, so the sum S1·S2 + ... = \hbar² - 9/4 \hbar² = -5/4 \hbar².

Therefore, H |psi> = A*(-5/4 \hbar²) |psi>, so the expectation value is -5/4 A \hbar².

But this contradicts the given correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of expectation value.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value of H as follows.

Given H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Express each term S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 in terms of their eigenvalues.

Wait, for each pair, in |psi>, the spin
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I've got this problem about three spin 1/2 particles and a Hamiltonian given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. The state provided is psi = (1/sqrt(3))*(|↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what its energy is. If it's not, we need to find the expectation value of E.

Okay, first off, I remember that for spin systems, especially with multiple particles, the Hamiltonian involving dot products of spin operators can be related to total spin. Specifically, S1·S2 is part of the Casimir operator for the total spin, which is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². So, maybe I can express H in terms of S_total².

Let me write that out. S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I rearrange that, I can get S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be written as H = A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ). Since each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², so S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Substituting that back into H, we get H = A*( (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ). So, H = (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²). 

Now, I can think about the state psi. It's given as a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. Let's see, this looks like a state with total spin S_total = 1. Because when you have two up and one down spins, the total spin is 1. The multiplet for S_total=1 has states with m_s = -1, 0, +1. Wait, actually, in the state psi, all the states have two ups and one down, so their m_total is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So, wait, actually, m_total is 1/2, but the total spin S_total is 1, since for each m, it can be 1, 0, -1. So, the m=1/2 state is part of the S_total=1 multiplet.

Therefore, the state psi is part of the S_total=1 triplet. So, the eigenvalue of S_total² for this state should be S_total(S_total + 1)ħ² = 1*(2)ħ² = 2ħ².

So, substituting back into H, the expectation value of H would be the expectation value of (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²). Since S_total² is 2ħ² for this state, the expectation value is (A/2)*(2ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)*(-1/4 ħ²) = -A/(8) ħ².

Wait, but the given answer says it's 2/3 A ħ². Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The state psi is symmetric under permutation of particles 1, 2, 3? Let's see. The state is |↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩. If you swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes |↑2↑1↓3⟩ which is same as the first term because it's symmetric. Similarly, swapping 1 and 3, the first term becomes |↑3↑2↓1⟩, which is not present. So actually, the state is not symmetric under all permutations, maybe it's only symmetric under cyclic permutations? Or perhaps it's a different symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should look at the total spin more carefully. If the state is |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩, what is the total spin of this state? Each term has two spins up and one spin down. The total spin S_total can be 1 or 0. Wait, is it possible for this state to have S_total=0?

If the state is symmetric, then yes, but is this state symmetric? Let me see: since each term has two ups and one down, swapping particles doesn't change the state because each term is a different permutation. So actually, the state is symmetric under permutation of particles, so it should be in the symmetric subspace.

But for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace can be either the S_total=1 triplet or a combination of S_total=1 and S_total=0. Hmm, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states can be either S_total=1 or a mixture of S_total=1 and S_total=0? Wait, no, actually, for three particles, the symmetric states can have S_total=1 and S_total=0. Because the symmetric subspace is 6-dimensional, but the triplet (S_total=1) is 3-dimensional, and the singlet (S_total=0) is 1-dimensional. Hmm, wait, that doesn't add up. 3+1 is 4, but the symmetric subspace is bigger. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something.

Wait, no, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). The symmetric subspace includes all symmetric states regardless of spin, so it's a combination of the triplet and singlet. So, if a state is symmetric, it can be a combination of S_total=1 and S_total=0 states.

But in our case, the given state has two spins up and one down. Let's see, how does that decompose into S_total=1 and S_total=0.

Wait, the state |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ is symmetric, and each term has S_z = 1/2. So, for S_total=1, the states have m=1, 0, -1. So, the m=1 state is (|↑↑↑⟩), which isn't in our state. The m=0 state is (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3). Wait, that's similar but has a different coefficient. Our state is |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩, which is different.

Wait, let me think. Maybe if I compute the action of S_total² on our state, I can see whether it's an eigenstate or not.

Alternatively, let me calculate the expectation value of H. Since H is expressed as (A/2)(S_total² - 9/4 ħ²), and S_total² is an operator, maybe I can compute its expectation value for the state psi.

But to compute ⟨S_total²⟩, we need to know the eigenvalues for S_total² in this state.

Wait, but is psi an eigenstate of S_total²? If it is, then yes, otherwise, we might have some cross terms. Let me check.

Given that psi is symmetric, maybe it's an eigenstate of S_total².

Wait, another way: perhaps the state can be expressed as a combination of S_total=1 and S_total=0 states.

Suppose psi = a |S=1, m=1⟩ + b |S=0, m=0⟩. Wait, but in our state, the m is 1/2 for each term, so maybe it's a combination of S=1 and S=0 with different m's. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total_z, but not necessarily of S_total². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ⟨S_total²⟩ for psi. Let's see.

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, ⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨S1²⟩ + ⟨S2²⟩ + ⟨S3²⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But since all particles are identical and the state psi is symmetric, the expectation value ⟨S1²⟩ = ⟨S2²⟩ = ⟨S3²⟩. Each ⟨S_i²⟩ is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

So, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩).

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)*(⟨S_total²⟩ - 9/4 ħ²).

So, if I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

Alternatively, if I can find ⟨S_total²⟩ for the state psi, that would help.

But how?

Well, let's recall that S_total² |psi⟩ equals something. If psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then it would just be proportional to S_total² |psi⟩. Otherwise, we have to compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately.

But perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩ since the state is symmetric.

So, each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ is (1/4)( (⟨↑↑↑|S_i·S_j|↓↓↓⟩ + ... )). Wait, maybe that's a bit vague.

Wait, another approach: since all particles are spin 1/2, the spin operators can be expressed in terms of Pauli matrices. But that might get too complicated.

Alternatively, recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2². So, perhaps I can use that identity.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2. But in this case, each particle is spin 1/2, so S1² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1·S2 = (S12² - 9/4 ħ²)/2, where S12 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

Similarly, S1·S3 = (S13² - 9/4 ħ²)/2, and same for S2·S3.

But then, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A/2*(S12² + S13² + S23² - 9/2 ħ²). Hmm, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ for the state psi.

For two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/4)(I⊗I + 2S1_z S2_z + 2S1_x S2_x + 2S1_y S2_y). So, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ for a product state |↑↑⟩ is (1/4)(1*1 + 2*(1/2)(1/2) + 2*(1/2)(1/2) + 2*0) = (1/4)(1 + 1/2 + 1/2) = (1/4)(2) = 1/2.

But in our state, the particles are entangled, so the expectation value might not be the sum of individual expectations.

Wait, but our state psi is a symmetric combination. Let's see:

psi = (|↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩)/sqrt(3).

So, to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, we need to compute the expectation value of S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z for the state psi.

Similarly, for ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩, we can compute them.

But this seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to note that the state psi is the same as the symmetric state |112⟩ + |121⟩ + |211⟩ (using shorthand |↑↑↓⟩ etc.), so perhaps it's part of the S_total=1 or S_total=0 subspace.

Wait, let me recall that the total spin S_total = 1 has states with m = -1, 0, +1, each of which is a symmetric combination. Similarly, S_total=0 has a singlet state.

But our state has m = 1/2 for each term, so it might not be an eigenstate of S_total². Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the action of S_total² on psi. Let me try.

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total² psi = (S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) psi.

But since S1², S2², S3² each act as (3/4)ħ², their sum is 9/4 ħ². So, S_total² psi = 9/4 ħ² psi + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi = (2/A) H psi.

Therefore, S_total² psi = (9/4 ħ² + (2/A) H) psi.

Wait, but I don't know H psi yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (S_total² - (9/4) ħ²) psi = (2/A) H psi.

If psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then this holds.

But whether psi is an eigenstate of S_total² is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total² for psi, which would involve calculating ⟨psi|S_total²|psi⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state psi is in the subspace of symmetric states with two spins up and one spin down, so perhaps it's a combination of S_total=1 and S_total=0.

Wait, the triplet S_total=1 has three states: |1,1⟩, |1,0⟩, |1,-1⟩. Each of these is symmetric under permutation.

But our state has m=1/2. Let me compute the S_total_z for our state.

Each term in psi has two spins up (each with z-component +1/2) and one spin down (z-component -1/2). So, total m_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So, our state has m_z=1/2.

But the triplet S_total=1 has a state with m_z=1, which is |↑↑↑⟩, but that's not in our state. The other states in the triplet have m_z=0 and m_z=-1.

Wait, is there a way to express psi as a combination of triplet states?

Yes, perhaps. Let me recall that the triplet states are:

|1,1⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩,

|1,0⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3),

|1,-1⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

Similarly, the singlet state is |0,0⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Wait, so our state is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3), which is similar but different from |1,0⟩.

Wait, |1,0⟩ is (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3). So, our state has a plus in front of all terms, while |1,0⟩ has a mix of pluses and minuses.

So, if I denote our state as psi = |S=1, m=0⟩? Wait, no, because in |1,0⟩, m=0, but in our psi, the m is 1/2.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, m is the total z-component. Each term in psi has two ups and one down, so m_z=1/2. So, our state has m_z=1/2, which is not a state in the triplet because the triplet has m_z=1, 0, -1. So, how can a state with m_z=1/2 have total spin S_total=1? It can't, because S_total=1 can't have m_z=1/2. Therefore, perhaps our state is not in the S_total=1 subspace.

Wait, that can't be, because if you have two spins up and one spin down, the total spin can be 1 or 0.

Wait, but in this case, if m_z=1/2, then S_total can't be 1 because S_total=1 has m_z=1, 0, -1. So, maybe our state is in S_total=0? But the S_total=0 state has m_z=0.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe let me think of the possible states.

For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are:

- S_total=1, m_z=1, 0, -1,

- S_total=0, m_z=0.

So, any state must be a combination of these.

Our state has m_z=1/2, so it must be a combination of the states in S_total=1 and S_total=0.

Since S_total=0 has m_z=0, and S_total=1 has m_z=1, 0, -1. So, our state must be a combination of |1,1⟩, |1,0⟩, and |0,0⟩.

But let me think: if we have a state with m_z=1/2, how can it be expressed in terms of the above?

Wait, perhaps using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me consider combining two spin 1/2 particles to get spin 1, then combining with the third spin 1/2.

But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can directly compute the action of S_total² on psi.

But computing S_total² psi is going to involve a lot of terms, so maybe it's better to consider the expectation value.

Wait, let me consider that the state psi is symmetric, so the expectation value of S_total² can be computed as follows.

The symmetric subspace for three spin 1/2 particles is 6-dimensional (since spin states are 2^3=8, and symmetric ones are 4? Wait, no. For three particles, the symmetric states under permutation are more than that. Actually, the number of symmetric states is given by the number of orbits under the action of the symmetric group S3. For spin states, which are in a 8-dimensional space, the number of symmetric states would be the sum over irreducible representations of the symmetric group S3. The spin states transformation under S3 is a bit involved, but perhaps it's not necessary.

Alternatively, since the state psi is symmetric, I can express it in terms of the basis states of the symmetric subspace.

But maybe it's too involved. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the Hamiltonian H in terms of the number of spin-up and spin-down particles.

But given that H is a sum of dot products, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value ⟨H⟩ as A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = 3A*⟨S1·S2⟩.

So, if I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for the state psi, I can get the expectation value.

So, how to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

The operator S1·S2 can be written as ½ (S1 + S2)² - (S1² + S2²)/2.

Wait, actually, more precisely, S1·S2 = (S1 + S2)^2 / 2 - (S1² + S2²)/2.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = [⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - ⟨S1² + S2²⟩ ] / 2.

But for spin-1/2 particles, S1² = S2² = (3/4)ħ², so ⟨S1² + S2²⟩ = 9/4 ħ².

Now, ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = ⟨S1² + S2² + 2S1·S2⟩. But that's the same as 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2⟩.

Wait, so if I have:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2.

But then, substituting ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2⟩.

So, plugging that back in, I have:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ (9/4 ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2⟩) - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 = [2⟨S1·S2⟩]/2 = ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Which is just an identity, so that doesn't help.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 for the state psi.

Let's write S1·S2 in terms of Pauli matrices. Recall that S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i, so S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2).

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4) ⟨σ1·σ2⟩.

So, if I can compute ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ for the state psi, I can find ⟨S1·S2⟩.

The operator σ1·σ2 is 3 for singlet state (since (σ1·σ2)|singlet⟩ = 1*|singlet⟩, but wait, actually, (σ1·σ2)|singlet⟩ = (σ1·σ2)( |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) = ( (σ1·σ2)|↑↓⟩ - (σ1·σ2)|↓↑⟩ ) = ( (1)(-1) |↑↓⟩ - (-1)(1)|↓↑⟩ ) = ( -|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) = -(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ ) = -|singlet⟩. So, (σ1·σ2)|singlet⟩ = -|singlet⟩.

Wait, so for the singlet state, (σ1·σ2)|singlet⟩ = -|singlet⟩. So, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ for the singlet state is -1.

For the triplet states, (σ1·σ2)|triplet⟩ = |triplet⟩, since (σ1·σ2)|triplet⟩ = (σ1·σ2)(|↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩ ) = (1, 0, 1) acting on the triplet states. So, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ for triplet states is 1.

But our state psi is a combination of singlet and triplet? Wait, no, it's a symmetric combination of two-ups and one-down. Let's see, is it in the triplet or singlet?

Wait, the singlet state is |0,0⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Our state is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3). So, it's similar but with different signs.

So, perhaps I can express psi as a combination of the triplet and singlet.

Let me denote:

|1,0⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

|0,0⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Our state is |psi⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3) = [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Comparing with |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩, we can write:

|psi⟩ = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩) = ( |1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩ + something? )

Wait, if I add |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩:

|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩ = [ (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩) + (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩) ] / sqrt(3) = [ 2|↑↑↓⟩ + 0|↑↓↑⟩ + 0|↓↑↑⟩ ] / sqrt(3) = (2 |↑↑↓⟩)/sqrt(3).

Not quite our state.

Wait, perhaps if we take a different combination.

Alternatively, let me use the fact that |psi⟩ is symmetric, so it can be written as a combination of symmetric states.

But maybe a better idea is to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 for |psi⟩.

So, ⟨psi| S1·S2 |psi⟩.

Express S1·S2 as (1/4)(I⊗I + 2S1_z S2_z + 2S1_x S2_x + 2S1_y S2_y).

So, we can write:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)⟨psi| (I⊗I + 2S1_z S2_z + 2S1_x S2_x + 2S1_y S2_y) |psi⟩.

Compute each term:

1. ⟨I⊗I⟩ = 1, since I is identity.

2. ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩: This is the expectation value of S1_z S2_z.

Similarly, 3. ⟨S1_x S2_x⟩, 4. ⟨S1_y S2_y⟩.

Compute each of these.

First, for ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩:

Each term in |psi⟩ has two spins up and one spin down. So, for each term:

- |↑↑↓⟩: S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = +1/2, so S1_z S2_z = 1/4.

Similarly for |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩, each term has exactly two spins up, so exactly two terms with S1_z S2_z = 1/4, and one term with S1_z S2_z = (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4? Wait no.

Wait, in |↑↑↓⟩, S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = +1/2, S3_z = -1/2.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = -1/2, S3_z = +1/2.

In |↓↑↑⟩, S1_z = -1/2, S2_z = +1/2, S3_z = +1/2.

So, in each term in psi, S1_z S2_z is:

- For |↑↑↓⟩: (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4,

- For |↑↓↑⟩: (+1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4,

- For |↓↑↑⟩: (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4.

Therefore, when we compute ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩ for |psi⟩, it's the average of these three terms.

So, each term has coefficient 1/sqrt(3), so the expectation value is (1/3)*(1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) = (1/3)*(-1/4) = -1/12.

So, ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩ = -1/12 ħ², but wait, S_z is in units of ħ/2. So, actually, S1_z = (ħ/2) σ_z, so S1_z S2_z = (ħ²/4) σ_z ⊗ σ_z. Therefore, ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩ = (ħ²/4) * (-1/12). Wait, no:

Wait, I think I messed up.

Actually, S1_z and S2_z are spin operators with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So, S1_z S2_z has eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 (σ_z ⊗ σ_z). So, the operator S1_z S2_z has eigenvalues (ħ²/4)(1, -1, -1) for the basis states |↑↑↑⟩, |↑↓↓⟩, |↓↑↓⟩, etc.

But in our case, for each term in |psi⟩, S1_z S2_z is (ħ²/4)*(1, -1, -1), but our state is |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: For each term in |psi⟩, compute S1_z S2_z, then average.

For |↑↑↓⟩: S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = +1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

For |↑↓↑⟩: S1_z = +1/2, S2_z = -1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (-1/4).

For |↓↑↑⟩: S1_z = -1/2, S2_z = +1/2, so S1_z S2_z = (-1/4).

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩ is [ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] / 3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

But note that S1_z and S2_z are in units of ħ/2, so the actual expectation value is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * ( -1/12 )? Wait, no, that would be if each operator had eigenvalues in units of (ħ/2), but when you take the product, the eigenvalues are in terms of (ħ/2)^2. So, the expectation value is (1/4)ħ² * (-1/12). Wait, no:

Wait, I think I confused the representation. Let me think.

Each spin operator S_i has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So, S_i = ħ/2 σ_i. Therefore, S1_z S2_z = (ħ/2)^2 (σ_z ⊗ σ_z). So, their product has eigenvalues (ħ²/4)(1, -1, -1, ...) depending on the state.

So, when we compute ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩, it's (ħ²/4) times the expectation value of σ_z ⊗ σ_z.

From the state |psi⟩, we have:

⟨σ_z ⊗ σ_z⟩ = [ (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) ] / 3.

Wait, no, hold on. For each term in |psi⟩, which is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, we can compute σ_z for each particle.

For |↑↑↓⟩: σ_z for particles 1 and 2 are +1, for particle 3 is -1. So, σ_z ⊗ σ_z = (+1)(+1) = 1.

For |↑↓↑⟩: σ_z for particles 1 is +1, 2 is -1, 3 is +1. So, σ_z ⊗ σ_z = (+1)(-1) = -1.

For |↓↑↑⟩: σ_z for particles 1 is -1, 2 is +1, 3 is +1. So, σ_z ⊗ σ_z = (-1)(+1) = -1.

Therefore, ⟨σ_z ⊗ σ_z⟩ = (1 + (-1) + (-1))/3 = (-1)/3.

Therefore, ⟨S1_z S2_z⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1/3) = -ħ²/12.

So, that's the expectation value for S1_z S2_z.

Now, for the other terms: ⟨S1_x S2_x⟩, ⟨S1_y S2_y⟩.

Note that S_x and S_y can be expressed in terms of raising and lowering operators.

But perhaps it's easier to compute them using the expectation value of σ_x ⊗ σ_x and σ_y ⊗ σ_y.

Recall that σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Similarly, σ_y |↑⟩ = -i |↓⟩, σ_y |↓⟩ = i |↑⟩.

But dealing with complex numbers might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity:

σ_x ⊗ σ_x = (S_x ⊗ S_x) = (ħ/2)^2 (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) ⊗ (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|).

But maybe an alternative approach: for each term in |psi⟩, compute ⟨σ_x ⊗ σ_x⟩ and ⟨σ_y ⊗ σ_y⟩.

Wait, let me think about |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

For each term, compute ⟨σ_x ⊗ σ_x⟩ and ⟨σ_y ⊗ σ_y⟩.

But in each term, we have specific spin states, so perhaps we can compute these expectations.

Starting with |↑↑↓⟩:

Compute ⟨σ_x ⊗ σ_x⟩ for |↑
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian, and a given spin state. The question is whether the state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what its energy is, or if not, what the expectation value of energy is.

First, let me parse the problem step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for particle i. So, H is a sum of the dot products of each pair of spin operators, multiplied by a constant A.

The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). So, it's a symmetric state where two spins are up and one is down. Let me note that this is a spin state, so it's a tensor product of spin states for each particle.

The question is whether psi is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the eigenvalue, which is supposed to be (2/3)*A*hbar^2. If not, find the expectation value.

Hmm. To check if psi is an eigenfunction, I need to compute H psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

Alternatively, if I can find the expectation value <H>, which would be (A/3)*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>). But wait, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so the expectation value would be A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

But the answer says it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3*A*hbar^2, which suggests that the expectation value is 2/3*A*hbar^2. That would mean that <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> = (2/3)*hbar^2.

Wait, let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators S_i satisfy S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Moreover, the total spin squared operator S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Plugging that into H, we get H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ² each, we can compute H as:

H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

Therefore, H can also be written as (A/2)*S_total^2 - (9/8)Aħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H is (A/2)*<S_total^2> - (9/8)Aħ².

So, if I can compute <S_total^2> for the given state psi, I can find the expectation value of H.

Let me recall that for a system of particles, the total spin squared operator S_total^2 acts on the state by summing the spins. For our state psi, which has two spins up and one spin down, it's not a singlet or triplet state, but instead a specific combination.

Wait, actually, let me think. The given state is symmetric under permutation of the particles, right? Since all permutations of particles 1,2,3 are involved.

Wait, the state is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). So, it's symmetric under permutation of the particles because each term is a cyclic permutation.

Therefore, the state is symmetric under permutation, which means that the total spin S_total^2 commutes with the permutation group, so we can compute <S_total^2> by considering the possible eigenvalues of S_total^2.

So, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. However, our state psi is not the fully symmetric triplet state (which is symmetric under permutation) but rather a specific combination.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation are the triplet states (which have S=1/2, but wait, no. Wait, triplet states for three spin-1/2 particles, wait, actually, for two particles, the triplet is symmetric (S=1) and the singlet is antisymmetric (S=0). For three particles, the possible total spin states are S=3/2 and S=1/2, but their symmetries vary.

Wait, this might be a point of confusion for me. Let me try to recall: for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation can be either the symmetric spin states with S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, no, S=3/2 is fully symmetric, while S=1/2 is a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2 for three spin-1/2 particles. The maximum spin is when all spins are aligned, so S=3/2. The other possibilities have lower spin.

The state psi given here is (up up down + up down up + down up up)/sqrt(3). Let me see: this is a state where two spins are up, and one is down, and the state is symmetric under cyclic permutation of the particles.

So, is this a singlet or triplet state? Wait, no, it's a combination of two up and one down spins.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the total spin squared operator expectation value <S_total^2> for the given state.

Alternatively, let me compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> directly.

So, we can compute each term <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3>, then sum them up, and multiply by A to get the expectation value.

To compute <S_i·S_j>, we can use the formula <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(<S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2>), but since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ², so <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( (3/4)ħ² + (3/4)ħ² - <S_ij^2> ) = (1/2)( (3/2)ħ² - <S_ij^2> ) = (3/4)ħ² - (1/2)<S_ij^2>.

Alternatively, since S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2). Wait, that's also correct.

But perhaps it's better to compute <S_i·S_j> directly.

Given that, let me define the state |psi> as ( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ) / sqrt(3).

So, each term in |psi> is a state with two spins up and one spin down.

So, for each pair (i,j), let me compute <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>.

Let me first compute <S1·S2>. Similarly for the others.

First, let me note that S_i·S_j = (1/4) Σ (σ_i · σ_j), where σ_i are the Pauli matrices, but that might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, S_i·S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

So, to compute <S1·S2>, I can compute the expectation value of each component separately.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

I know that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be computed for a given state.

In our case, for each pair (i,j), the state |psi> has certain properties.

Let me focus on pair (1,2). What is the expectation value <S1·S2> for the state |psi>?

Wait, the state |psi> is a symmetric superposition of states with two spins up and one spin down.

So, for |psi>, the total spin in each coordinate (x,y,z) is a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S1^z S2^z> for the state |psi>.

Because S1^z S2^z is one component of S1·S2.

Similarly, we can compute <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>.

But perhaps, for each pair (i,j), the expectation value <S_i·S_j> can be computed by considering the spins of i and j in the state |psi>.

Given that |psi> is symmetric in particles 1,2,3, perhaps each pair <S_i·S_j> is the same.

Wait, let me check that.

Is the state |psi> symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2?

Yes, because if you swap particles 1 and 2, the state becomes |↑2 ↑1 ↓3> + |↑1 ↓2 ↑3> + |↓1 ↑2 ↑3>, which is the same as the original state. So, the state is invariant under permutation of any two particles.

Therefore, the expectation values <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3> should all be equal.

Therefore, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3 <S1·S2>.

Therefore, if I can compute <S1·S2>, I can multiply it by 3 and get the total, then multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

So, let me compute <S1·S2>.

First, S1·S2 = S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

So, to compute the expectation value, I can compute the expectation of S1^x S2^x, S1^y S2^y, and S1^z S2^z separately.

Given that, let me consider each term.

First, compute <S1^z S2^z>.

Looking at the state |psi>, the z-component of spin for each particle is either +1/2 or -1/2.

Given that, let me write |psi> as:

( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ) / sqrt(3).

So, in each term, two particles are up, and one is down.

So, for each term, say |↑↑↓>, the first two particles are up, and the third is down.

Similarly, |↑↓↑> has the first up, second down, and third up.

|↓↑↑> has the first down, second and third up.

So, for each term, in the first two particles, sometimes both are up, sometimes one is up, one down.

Wait, actually, in each term, the first and second particles are both up in the first term, first and third in the second, and second and third in the third term.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Each term is |↑↑↓>, which is particles 1 and 2 up, 3 down.

|↑↓↑>, particles 1 and 3 up, 2 down.

|↓↑↑>, particles 2 and 3 up, 1 down.

So, in each term, any two particles are up, and one is down.

So, for the state |ψ>, each term has two up spins and one down spin, with the down spin in a different position in each term.

So, for each term in |ψ>, the dot product of the spins in the z-component would be:

In |↑↑↓>, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

So, S1^z S2^z = (+1/2)(+1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑>, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

S1^z S2^z = (-1/4).

Similarly, in |↓↑↑>, S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

S1^z S2^z = (-1/4).

So, each term in |ψ> has one value of S1^z S2^z: either 1/4, -1/4, or -1/4.

Wait, actually, let me compute the expectation value <S1^z S2^z> as the average over the state |ψ>.

So, |ψ> is ( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ) / sqrt(3).

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> is equal to the average over these three terms.

Each term contributes as follows:

For |↑↑↓>, the product S1^z S2^z is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>, S1^z S2^z = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

For |↓↑↑>, S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Therefore, the expectation value is (1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) / 3 = (1/4 - 2/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

But wait, each term is an equal superposition, so each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(3), so the expectation is (1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4)/3? Wait, no.

Wait, more precisely:

The expectation value is (1/3)*(1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)).

So, that's (1/3)*(1/4 - 1/4 -1/4) = (1/3)*(-1/4) = -1/12.

Therefore, <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12.

Similarly, what about <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>?

This is trickier because the expectation values involve the x and y components.

Recall that for spin-1/2 particles, S^x = (1/2)( |↑↓> + |↓↑> ) and S^y = (1/2)( |↑↓> - |↓↑> ).

Therefore, S_i^x S_j^x would be (1/2)( |↑↓><↑↓| + |↑↓><↓↑| + |↓↑><↑↓| + |↓↑><↓↑| ) / 4? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, actually, S_i^x is (1/2)( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ), similarly for S_j^x.

Therefore, S_i^x S_j^x is (1/2)( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ) ⊗ (1/2)( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ).

So, S_i^x S_j^x = (1/4)( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ) ⊗ ( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ).

Similarly for the y-components.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value <S1^x S2^x> for the state |psi>.

Alternatively, perhaps using some known identity or properties of the spin states.

Wait, another approach: since the state |psi> is symmetric under permutation, perhaps it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator S_total^2.

Wait, S_total^2 is given by (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S_total^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S_total^2 = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, we get:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

So, the expectation value of H is (A/2)*<S_total^2> - (9/8)Aħ².

So, if we can compute <S_total^2>, we can find the expectation value.

So, what is <S_total^2> for the state |psi>?

We can think of S_total^2 acting on |psi>:

S_total^2 |psi> = ( (S1 + S2 + S3)² ) |psi> = ( S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ) |psi>.

But since each S_i² |psi> = (3/4)ħ² |psi>, because each S_i^2 acts on each spin-1/2 particle and gives 3/4 ħ² times the identity.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = ( (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ) |psi>.

Therefore, if we can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 when acting on |psi>, we can compute <S_total^2>.

Alternatively, note that |psi> is a symmetric state, so it might be an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, but what are the possible eigenvalues of S_total^2 for three spin-1/2 particles?

The possible total spins are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2.

Each corresponds to an eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ².

So, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ², then we can find <S_total^2> as that eigenvalue.

So, is |psi> an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Hmm.

Wait, |psi> is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down.

In the case of three spins, the singlet state (S=0) is antisymmetric under permutation, but our state is symmetric, so it can't be S=0.

The triplet state (S=1/2) is symmetric, but wait, actually, for three spins, the singlet state is S=0, which is symmetric in a different way.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how |psi> transforms under permutation.

Given that |psi> is symmetric under permutation, it can be written as a combination of states that are symmetric under permutation.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states can be either the maximum spin state (all spins up) or a combination with S=1/2.

Wait, actually, the maximum spin state is |↑↑↑>, which is symmetric, and its total spin is S=3/2.

The other symmetric states must have lower spin.

So, |psi> is a symmetric state with two spins up and one down.

So, perhaps it's a part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, but let me think about how the total spin acts on |psi>.

If |psi> is a part of the S=1/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² |psi> = (3/4)ħ² |psi>.

If it's part of the S=3/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 |psi> = (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ² |psi> = (15/4) ħ² |psi>.

So, which is it?

Wait, let me think about the possible total spin states.

The maximum spin for three spin-1/2 particles is 3/2, which is the state where all spins are up, |↑↑↑>.

Other states are combinations of this with the lowering operators.

But our state |psi> is a combination of two up and one down, which is analogous to a co-spin state, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I can check the action of S_total^2 on |psi>.

Alternatively, perhaps an easier way is to compute the eigenvalue <S_total^2> for |psi> by considering the possible actions.

Wait, another approach: since the state |psi> is symmetric, perhaps it can be expressed in terms of the symmetric total spin states.

But to avoid getting too stuck here, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> directly.

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, as before, S_total^2 = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(sum S_i·S_j).

Thus, <S_total^2> = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

But from earlier, we had <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = same value.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed <S1^z S2^z>, I found it was -1/12, but I didn't compute <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total S_total^2 by another method.

Wait, since |psi> is symmetric, let's try to find |psi> in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, the fully symmetric spin state for three particles is |↑↑↑>, which has S=3/2.

The other symmetric states are from the S=1/2 representation.

So, for S=1/2, the states are combinations of two up and one down spins.

Indeed, our state |psi> is one of those.

Therefore, |psi> is part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, <S_total^2> = (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, going back to the expression for H:

H = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

Therefore, the expectation value <H> is (A/2)*<S_total^2> - (9/8) A ħ² = (A/2)*(3/4 ħ²) - (9/8) A ħ².

Calculating that:

(A/2)*(3/4 ħ²) = (3/8) A ħ².

(9/8) A ħ² is just (9/8) A ħ².

Therefore, <H> = (3/8 - 9/8) A ħ² = (-6/8) A ħ² = (-3/4) A ħ².

Wait, that can't be, because the supposed answer is (2/3) A ħ².

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check.

If |psi> is a state in the S=1/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>.

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 3/4 ħ².

Then, <H> = (A/2)*(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)*(-3/2 ħ²) = -3/4 A ħ².

But the given answer is (2/3) A ħ².

Hmm, so maybe my assumption that |psi> is in the S=1/2 multiplet is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, but if that's the case, how?

Wait, earlier, when I considered <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>, I thought it was 3*(something). But actually, I just found that if |psi> is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (3/4) ħ² for S_total^2, then the sum <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> is ( (3/4) - (9/4) ) / 2 = (-6/4)/2 = (-3/2)/2 = -3/4.

Wait, no, wait, let's go back.

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Thus, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

Each <S_i^2> = (3/4) ħ², so sum is 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(sum <S_i·S_j>).

From earlier, if |psi> is in the S=1/2 multiplet, then <S_total^2> = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Thus:

3/4 ħ² = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(sum <S_i·S_j>).

So, 2*(sum <S_i·S_j>) = 3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² = -6/4 ħ².

Thus, sum <S_i·S_j> = (-6/4 ħ²)/2 = -3/4 ħ².

Hence, <H> = A*(sum <S_i·S_j>) = A*(-3/4 ħ²) = -3/4 A ħ².

But according to the given answer, it should be 2/3 A ħ².

So, that suggests that either my assumption that |psi> is in the S=1/2 multiplet is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's consider another approach.

Compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> directly.

Earlier, I computed <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/12).

But what about <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y>?

Compute each component.

First, let's compute <S1^x S2^x>.

Note that S1^x acting on particle 1 and S2^x acting on particle 2.

But how does this act on the state |psi>?

Given that |psi> is a symmetric combination, perhaps we can find the expectation value.

Let me note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x can be computed as follows:

The state |psi> is ( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ) / sqrt(3).

Let me write each term in terms of computational basis.

For each term in |psi>:

1. |↑↑↓>: S1^x = (|↑↓> + |↓↑>)/2, S2^x = (|↑↓> + |↓↑>)/2.

But since S2 is acting on the second particle, which is ↑, so S2^x |↑↑↓> = (|↑↓> + |↓↑>)/2 |↑↑↓> = (|↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>)/2.

Similarly, S1^x |↑↑↓> = (|↑↓> + |↓↑>)/2 |↑↑↓> = (|↑↓↓> + |↓↑↓>)/2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can use the fact that for spin-1/2 particles, S_i^x = (1/2)(σ_i^x), where σ_i^x are the Pauli matrices.

Therefore, S_i^x S_j^x = (1/4)(σ_i^x ⊗ σ_j^x).

Therefore, the expectation value <S1^x S2^x> is (1/4) <σ1^x σ2^x>.

But the expectation value <σ1^x σ2^x> is equivalent to the dot product of the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, more precisely, for two spin-1/2 particles in the state |a> and |b>, the expectation value <σ1^x σ2^x> is equal to <a|σ1^x|a> <b|σ2^x|b> + <a|σ1^x|b> <b|σ2^x|a> + <a|σ2^x|a> <b|σ1^x|b> + <a|σ2^x|b> <b|σ1^x|a>.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to compute <σ1^x σ2^x> for the combined state.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the matrix elements.

Wait, let me note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x in a product state |↑↑> is (1)(1) = 1.

Wait, but in our case, the state is a combination.

Wait, perhaps I can write |psi> as a combination of product states and compute the expectation.

Alternatively, note that S1 · S2 = (1/4) (σ1 · σ2).

Therefore, <S1 · S2> = (1/4) <σ1 · σ2>.

The expectation value <σ1 · σ2> can be computed as the sum of the expectations of each Pauli matrix.

But σ1 · σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Therefore, <σ1 · σ2> = <σ1^x σ2^x> + <σ1^y σ2^y> + <σ1^z σ2^z>.

We already computed <σ1^z σ2^z> as -1/12.

Now, what about <σ1^x σ2^x> and <σ1^y σ2^y>?

Let me compute <σ1^x σ2^x> first.

Recall that σ1^x is the Pauli x matrix for particle 1, and σ2^x for particle 2.

The product σ1^x σ2^x acts on the two-particle Hilbert space.

Similarly, for the state |psi>, which is a symmetric combination of three product states.

To compute <σ1^x σ2^x>, we can use the fact that σ1^x σ2^x is a Hermitian operator, and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each product state in |psi>, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x is (1/4), because σ1^x |↑> = (|↓> + |↑>)/2, and similarly for σ2^x. Therefore, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑> = (|↓↑> + |↑↓> + |↑↓> + |↓↑>)/4 = (|↓↑> + |↑↓>)/2.

Thus, <σ1^x σ2^x> for |↑↑> is ( <↑| (σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑> ) > ) = (1/2)( <↑|↓> + <↑|↑> ) = (1/2)(0 + 1) = 1/2.

Wait, but this might not directly help, since our state |psi> is a combination of product states.

Wait, maybe let me compute <σ1^x σ2^x> for each term in |psi>:

Each term in |psi> is |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>.

Compute the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x for each term.

For |↑↑↓>:

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓> = ( (|↓> + |↑>)/2 ) ⊗ (|↓> + |↑>)/2 ) |↑↑↓>.

= ( |↓↓↓> + |↓↑↓> + |↑↓↓> + |↑↑↓> ) / 4.

Therefore, the expectation value is the coefficient of |↑↑↓> when projected back.

So, <↑↑↓| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓> = 1/4.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>:

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑> = (|↓> + |↑>)/2 ⊗ (|↑> + |↓>)/2 |↑↓↑>.

= ( |↓↑↑> + |↑↑↑> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↓↑> ) /4.

Projecting back, <↑↓↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑> = 1/4.

Similarly, for |↓↑↑>:

σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑> = (|↑> + |↓>)/2 ⊗ (|↑> + |↓>)/2 |↓↑↑>.

= ( |↑↑↑> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> + |↓↓↑> ) /4.

Projecting back, <↓↑↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑> = 1/4.

Therefore, each term in |psi> contributes 1/4 to the expectation value.

Thus, the total expectation value is (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4)/3 = (3/4)/3 = 1/4.

Therefore, <σ1^x σ2^x> = 1/4.

Similarly, what about <σ1^y σ2^y>?

Let me compute
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles and their Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and S1, S2, S3 are the spin operators for each particle. The state vector psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, what the energy is. If not, we need the expectation value of E.

First, I should recall some properties of spin-1/2 particles and spin operators. Each spin operator S_i is (ℏ/2) times the Pauli matrix for that particle. The dot product S_i·S_j is (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). So, S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the sum of the products of their individual spin components.

Given that, maybe I can compute S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately and then evaluate each term in the Hamiltonian.

But before that, I need to figure out how to compute S1·S2 acting on the state psi. Since S1·S2 is an operator, acting on psi will give me a new state, and then I can take the inner product with psi again to find the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a more clever way using symmetry or properties of the state.

Looking at the state psi, it's symmetric in a way. Let me write it out:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So, it's a symmetric combination where two spins are up and one is down. That seems like a particular symmetry, maybe related to the total spin or something else.

I remember that for spin systems, it's sometimes useful to consider the total spin operator S = S1 + S2 + S3. Maybe I can express S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 in terms of S².

Indeed, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 equals (1/2)(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²). Let me verify that:

S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2S1·S2 + 2S1·S3 + 2S2·S3.

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

That seems useful because then maybe we can compute H in terms of S² and the individual spins squared.

Since each spin is spin-1/2, S1² = (3/4)ℏ², similarly for S2² and S3².

So, let's compute H:

H = A*( (S² - 3*(3/4)ℏ² ) / 2 )

Wait, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ℏ² = (9/4)ℏ²? No, wait, each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ² = (3/4)ℏ². So, the sum is 3*(3/4)ℏ² = (9/4)ℏ².

So, S1² + S2² + S3² = (9/4)ℏ².

Therefore, H = A*(S² - (9/4)ℏ²)/2.

So, H = (A/2)(S² - (9/4)ℏ²).

Therefore, H can be written as (A/2) S² - (A/2)*(9/4)ℏ².

So, H = (A/2) S² - (9A/8) ℏ².

Now, if I can compute S² acting on the state psi, then I can find the expectation value.

Alternatively, if psi is an eigenstate of S², then H will be just a multiple of psi. Otherwise, we can find the expectation value.

So, what is S²? It is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. So, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But we already have that expression.

But since we're dealing with S², perhaps it's useful to know the eigenvalues of S² for given total spin.

Since we have three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

To find which one it is, we can compute the eigenvalue of S².

Given that psi is a symmetric state, it might belong to a specific representation. Let me think.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. So, is this state symmetric under permutation of spins? Let me see.

Yes, because all terms are symmetric. So, the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, but let's check whether it's an eigenstate of the total spin S².

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S² on psi.

But that might get complicated. Maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalue of S².

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the state is symmetric under permutations, maybe the total spin is either 0 or 1, but wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But the given state has two spins up and one spin down. Let me count the total spin.

If we have two spins up, which have spin 1/2 each, and one spin down, which is also 1/2. The total spin is determined by the combination.

But wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 if all three are aligned, but in this case, they are not all aligned. They have two up and one down.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a singlet state? No, because three spins can form a triplet or a singlet.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 1/2 or 3/2.

The symmetric states would correspond to higher spins, and antisymmetric to lower spins? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet (spin 1) is symmetric, and the singlet (spin 0) is antisymmetric.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the situation is more complex. There are multiple possibilities for the total spin.

I recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, there are four possible total spin states: S=3/2 (which is symmetric) and S=1/2 (which is antisymmetric). But actually, wait, the number of possible spin states is 2^3=8, but considering symmetries, they form representations of the permutation group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the possible eigenvalues for S².

The possible eigenvalues of S² are S(S+1)ℏ², where S is the total spin, so for each particle spin-1/2, we can have total spin 3/2 or 1/2.

So, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S², then we can compute its eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S².

But to compute the expectation value of S², I need to compute <psi| S² |psi>.

Hmm. Let me think.

Given that S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already have an expression for H in terms of S².

We also have that H is equal to (A/2)(S² - (9/4)ℏ²).

So, if we can compute <psi| H |psi>, it would be (A/2) <psi| S² |psi> - (A/2)(9/4)ℏ².

But perhaps to compute <psi| S² |psi>, we can compute <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately, since each of those terms can be evaluated individually.

Remember that the expectation value of S_i·S_j is (1/2)(<S_i^x S_j^x> + <S_i^y S_j^y> + <S_i^z S_j^z>).

Given that each spin is spin-1/2, so each S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2.

But for the expectation values, since the state is a symmetric combination, we might be able to compute them without getting into the nitty-gritty of the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let's think about the expectation value of S_i^k S_j^k for k=x,y,z.

Given that the state psi is (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), so each term has two up spins and one down spin.

Compute <psi| S_i^k S_j^k |psi> for each pair (i,j). Since the state is symmetric, the expectation values should be the same for each pair. So, all the terms S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 will have the same expectation value.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 is equal to the expectation value of S1·S3, which is equal to the expectation value of S2·S3.

So, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = <psi| (S1·S2) |psi> = (1/3) [ <up1 up2 down3| + <up1 down2 up3| + <down1 up2 up3| ] acting on each term.

Wait, perhaps that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe we can compute the expectation value of S_i^k S_j^k for each component.

First, let's compute <S_i^x S_j^x>, <S_i^y S_j^y>, and <S_i^z S_j^z> for each pair (i,j).

Starting with S_i^z S_j^z.

In the state psi, for each term, say |↑↑↓⟩, the z-component of S1 is +ℏ/2, S2 is +ℏ/2, and S3 is -ℏ/2.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is +ℏ/2, S2 is -ℏ/2, S3 is +ℏ/2.

For |↓↑↑⟩, S1 is -ℏ/2, S2 is +ℏ/2, S3 is +ℏ/2.

So, for each term, let's look at the product S_i^z S_j^z.

For the pair (1,2):

In |↑↑↓⟩: S1^z S2^z = (+ℏ/2)^2 = (ℏ²)/4.

In |↑↓↑⟩: S1^z S2^z = (+ℏ/2)*(-ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

In |↓↑↑⟩: S1^z S2^z = (-ℏ/2)*(+ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

So, the expectation value for S1^z S2^z is the average of these three terms.

So, <S1^z S2^z> = (1/3)[ (ℏ²)/4 + (-ℏ²)/4 + (-ℏ²)/4 ] = (1/3)[ ( (1 -1 -1)/4 )ℏ² ] = (1/3)(-ℏ²/4) = -ℏ²/12.

Similarly, for the other pairs.

For pair (1,3):

Looking at each term:

In |↑↑↓⟩: S1^z S3^z = (+ℏ/2)*(-ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

In |↑↓↑⟩: S1^z S3^z = (+ℏ/2)*(+ℏ/2) = (ℏ²)/4.

In |↓↑↑⟩: S1^z S3^z = (-ℏ/2)*(+ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

So, <S1^z S3^z> is (1/3)[ -ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4 ] = (1/3)( -ℏ²/4 ) = -ℏ²/12.

Same for pair (2,3):

In |↑↑↓⟩: S2^z S3^z = (+ℏ/2)*(-ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

In |↑↓↑⟩: S2^z S3^z = (-ℏ/2)*(+ℏ/2) = - (ℏ²)/4.

In |↓↑↑⟩: S2^z S3^z = (+ℏ/2)*(+ℏ/2) = (ℏ²)/4.

Thus, <S2^z S3^z> = (1/3)[ -ℏ²/4 - ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4 ] = (1/3)( -ℏ²/4 ) = -ℏ²/12.

So, each of the diagonal terms (S_i^z S_j^z) has expectation value -ℏ²/12. Therefore, each <S_i^z S_j^z> = -ℏ²/12.

Now, moving on to the x and y components. Let's compute <S_i^x S_j^x> and <S_i^y S_j^y>.

But the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x is a bit more tricky because spin states are in superpositions.

Recall that S_i^x and S_j^x are spin operators that can be written in terms of Pauli matrices.

For spin-1/2 particles, S_i^x = (ℏ/2) σ_i^x, where σ_i^x is the Pauli x matrix for particle i.

Similarly for S_i^y and S_i^z.

The product S_i^x S_j^x can be expressed as (ℏ/2)^2 σ_i^x σ_j^x.

But since we're dealing with expectation values, we can compute <psi| σ_i^x σ_j^x |psi>.

Given that the state is symmetric, perhaps we can use some symmetry properties.

Alternatively, perhaps we can recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ_i · σ_j is a known quantity.

Wait, let's think about it.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the state |↑↑⟩ has σ_i · σ_j = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) for i and j. Wait, no.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles in the singlet and triplet states:

The singlet state has total spin 0, so S_total^2 = 0, and S_total^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, 0 = (3/4 ℏ² + 3/4 ℏ²) + 2 S1·S2.

Which gives S1·S2 = - (6/4 ℏ²)/2 = - (3/4) ℏ².

Wait, that's the expectation value of S1·S2 for the singlet state.

Similarly, for the triplet state, which has S=1, so S1·S2 = [S(S+1)ℏ² - S1² - S2²]/2.

Which is [2ℏ² - (3/4 ℏ² + 3/4 ℏ²)] /2 = [2ℏ² - (3/2 ℏ²)]/2 = (1/2 ℏ²)/2 = (1/4) ℏ².

Therefore, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is -3/4 ℏ² for the singlet and +1/4 ℏ² for each of the triplet states.

Wait, but our state psi is a symmetric combination of two ups and one down. So, perhaps it's related to a particular state in the spin system.

Wait, maybe we can think of this state as a particular state in the Hilbert space and compute the expectation value.

Let me think about what the state looks like. It has two spins up and one spin down. So, it's similar to a state where one particle is down and the other two are up. So, it's a state with total spin not all aligned.

But to compute the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x and S_i^y S_j^y, perhaps we can use the fact that for any two particles, S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y = (S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) / 2 + ... Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the average of σ_i^x σ_j^x and σ_i^y σ_j^y.

But in quantum mechanics, for two spins, the expectation value of σ_i · σ_j is given by (Tr(ρ σ_i σ_j)) where ρ is the state's density matrix.

But in this case, our state is |psi>, which is a ket vector, not a density matrix. So, the expectation value is <psi| σ_i σ_j |psi>.

Alternatively, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value <σ_i · σ_j> can be computed as <σ_i · σ_j> = Tr( |psi><psi| σ_i σ_j )

But this is equal to the sum over the diagonal elements of |psi><psi| σ_i σ_j.

Alternatively, since our state is a combination of product states, maybe we can compute it explicitly.

Let me try that.

First, let's compute <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi>.

Given that psi is (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Let me denote the basis states as |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, psi = (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3).

Therefore, <a| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩:

In |a⟩, both spins 1 and 2 are up. σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩.

So, σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = σ1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

But |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩, so the inner product <a| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ is <↑↑↓ | ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩, and the result is |↓↓↓⟩? Wait, no, wait, σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = |↓↓⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

But |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩, so <a| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = <↑↑↓ | ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, for <b| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩.

|b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ2^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Thus, σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩.

So, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = <↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0, because the first qubit is down in |↑↓↑⟩, but |↓↑⟩ is acting on the first two qubits. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, actually, we need to be careful. Let me make sure.

σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = σ1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2^x |↓⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩. But |b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩, so when we compute <b| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩, we have:

<↑↓↑ | ↓↑ ↑⟩.

Wait, but σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ is |↓↑⟩ for the first two qubits, but the third qubit is still |↑⟩. So, the state is |↓↑↑⟩, which is |c⟩.

But |b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩, so <b| c⟩ is zero because the first qubit is different.

Wait, actually, σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = |↓↑⟩ for the first two qubits, but the third qubit is still |↑⟩, so the state is |↓↑↑⟩, which is |c⟩.

Therefore, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = <↑↓↑ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, for <c| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩.

|c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩.

Thus, σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = |↑↓⟩ for the first two qubits, and the third qubit remains |↑⟩, so the state is |↑↓↑⟩, which is |b⟩.

So, <c| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = <↓↑↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

So, the diagonal terms are all zero.

Now, what about the cross terms? For example, <a| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩.

So, |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, which is |c⟩.

Therefore, <a| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = <↑↑↓ | c⟩ = <↑↑↓ | ↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <a| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |b⟩.

So, <a| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = <↑↑↓ | b⟩ = <↑↑↓ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

Now, what about <b| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩?

σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

So, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = <↑↓↑ | ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |b⟩. So, <b|b⟩ = 1.

Wait, let me double-check:

σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = σ1^x |↓⟩ ⊗ σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩, so the state is |↑↓↑⟩, which is |b⟩.

Therefore, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = <↑↓↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 1.

Wait, no, wait: |c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩, which after σ1^x σ2^x becomes |↑↓↑⟩, which is |b⟩.

Thus, when we have <b| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩, it is <b|b⟩ = 1.

Wait, but in our earlier consideration, <b| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ is <b | σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = 1?

Wait, no, because ψ is (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3). So, when we compute <ψ| σ1^x σ2^x |ψ>, it's [ <a| + <b| + <c| ] σ1^x σ2^x [ |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ ] / 3.

So, let's compute each term:

1. <a| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩: 0
2. <a| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩: <a| c⟩ = 0
3. <a| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩: <a| b⟩ = 0
4. <b| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩: <b| c⟩ = 0
5. <b| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩: 0
6. <b| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩: <b| b⟩ = 1
7. <c| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩: <c| c⟩ = 1? Wait, no.

Wait, <c| σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩: |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩. σ1^x σ2^x |a⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

So, <c| ↓↓↓⟩: |c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩, so <↓↑↑ | ↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <c| σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩: σ1^x σ2^x |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, so <c| ↑↓↑↑⟩ = <↓↑↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

< c | σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩: |c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩. σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

So, <c| σ1^x σ2^x |c⟩ = <↓↑↑ | ↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to note that the cross terms might not vanish, but let me try again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use matrix representations.

But let me consider that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value <σ_i · σ_j> can be written in terms of the spin singlet and triplet states.

Given that the state psi is a symmetric combination, it must be in a triplet state.

Wait, hold on. For two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet states are symmetric, and the singlet is antisymmetric.

But in our case, the state |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ is a symmetric combination, so it's in the triplet space.

In the triplet space, the states are |S=1, m=1⟩, |S=1, m=0⟩, |S=1, m=-1⟩.

But our state is a combination of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, which is similar to the m=0 state.

Wait, actually, wait. Let's write the triplet states:

|S=1, m=1⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

|S=1, m=0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2).

|S=1, m=-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

Our state psi is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

Wait, that doesn't seem to be a state of two spins in a triplet. It's a three-spin state, not two-spin.

Hmm, maybe I confused that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to treat each pair (i,j) separately.

So, going back, we were trying to compute <σ1^x σ2^x> for the state psi.

But this seems time-consuming. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for each pair (i,j), the expectation value of S_i · S_j can be written as:

< S_i · S_j > = (1/2)(< S_i^x S_j^x > + < S_i^y S_j^y > + < S_i^z S_j^z > )

We already computed < S_i^z S_j^z > = -ℏ² / 12.

So, if we can compute < S_i^x S_j^x > and < S_i^y S_j^y >, we can add them to the z-component to get the total expectation value of S_i · S_j.

But these x and y components are tricky.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for the state |ψ>, which is symmetric, I can compute the expectation value of each term in the Hamiltonian.

Alternatively, let's recall that the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, H is the sum of the interactions between each pair.

We can compute the expectation value of H as 3*A*( < S1·S2 > ), since each pair has the same expectation due to symmetry.

Wait, actually, in our state, the interactions between each pair are similar because the state is symmetric.

So, each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) will have the same expectation value.

Therefore, the expectation value of H is 3*A*( < S1·S2 > ).

Therefore, if I can compute < S1·S2 >, I can multiply by 3*A to get < H >.

Earlier, we found that < S1^z S2^z > = -ℏ² / 12.

But what about < S1^x S2^x > and < S1^y S2^y >?

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1 · S2 can be computed as (1/2)( < S1^x S2^x > + < S1^y S2^y > + < S1^z S2^z > ).

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i · S_j is given by ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

But since we don't know the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2, unless we can relate it to the state.

Wait, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Thus, S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2.

So, the expectation value < S1·S2 > = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > - < S1^2 > - < S2^2 > ] / 2.

But each of S1^2 and S2^2 is (3/4) ℏ², so:

< S1·S2 > = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > - (3/4 ℏ² + 3/4 ℏ² ) ] / 2 = [ < (S1 + S2)^2 > - (3/2 ℏ² ) ] / 2.

So, to compute < S1·S2 >, I need to find < (S1 + S2)^2 >.

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so that brings us back.

Alternatively, we can note that (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ] / 2.

But in our state, if we can compute < S1 + S2 + S3 >², then we can find the sum of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Wait, but perhaps it's still not straightforward.

Wait, let's get back to computing < S1·S2 >.

Perhaps another idea: for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is given by ( S(S+1) - S1(S1 + 1) - S2(S2 + 1) ) * ℏ² / 2.

But this is when the state is in the S_total eigenstate.

But in our case, the state is a mixture, not an eigenstate.

Wait, so perhaps I can compute the average in the given state.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to note that for the state |ψ>, which is 1/sqrt(3)(|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), the expectation value of S1 · S2 can be computed by evaluating <ψ| S1 · S2 |ψ>.

Expressed as:

< S1 · S2 > = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] S1 · S2 [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Which expands to:

(1/3) [ <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> + <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑↑> + ... etc. ]

So, this would involve computing 9 terms. But that's a lot. Let's see if we can compute each term.

First, let's compute <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓>.

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

We already know <↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (ℏ²)/4.

Now, what about <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> and <↑↑↓| S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓>.

Similarly, compute for other terms.

Wait, S1^x and S2^x are 2x2 matrices. For the spin-up state, S1^x |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/sqrt(2) * ℏ/2? Wait, no.

Actually, S_i^x = (ℏ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2) |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑↓↓⟩.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4) |↓↓
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of E.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties of spin operators and eigenfunctions. Spin operators S_i are vectors, so their dot product S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator: S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. That might be helpful.

Wait, but since we have three particles, the Hamiltonian is a sum of three such dot products. So H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Maybe we can express this in terms of the total spin squared.

Let me denote S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So that gives S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2.

But each S_i^2 is (ħ^2)(s(s+1)) for spin s. Here, each particle is spin 1/2, so S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

So H = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2)/2 = (A/2)*(S_total^2) - (A/2)*(9/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, H can be written as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ^2. So to find the eigenvalue of H, we can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2.

Now, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin S_total can be 3/2 or 1/2. Because each spin is 1/2, adding three of them can give either 3/2 or 1/2. So the possible eigenvalues for S_total^2 are S(S+1)ħ^2, which would be (3/2)(5/2)ħ^2 = (15/4)ħ^2 or (1/2)(3/2)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are (A/2)*(15/4 ħ^2) - (9/8 A ħ^2) for S_total^2 = 15/4 ħ^2, and (A/2)*(3/4 ħ^2) - (9/8 A ħ^2) for S_total^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

Let me compute these:

First case:
(A/2)*(15/4 ħ^2) = (15/8) A ħ^2
Minus (9/8) A ħ^2: 15/8 - 9/8 = 6/8 = 3/4

So energy is (3/4) A ħ^2.

Second case:
(A/2)*(3/4 ħ^2) = (3/8) A ħ^2
Minus (9/8) A ħ^2: 3/8 - 9/8 = -6/8 = -3/4

So energy is (-3/4) A ħ^2.

But wait, is the state psi we're given in an eigenstate of S_total^2? Because if yes, then it's an eigenstate of H.

What is the state psi?

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)

Let me try to compute the total spin of this state. Hmm. Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So S_z is 1/2 * 1/2 * (-1/2) + similar? Wait, no.

Wait, each up state has spin +1/2, each down has spin -1/2. So for each term:

First term: up, up, down. So S_z = (1/2) + (1/2) + (-1/2) = 1/2.

Second term: up, down, up. Similarly, S_z = 1/2.

Third term: down, up, up. S_z = (-1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) = 1/2.

So each term has S_z = 1/2, so the state has total S_z = 1/2. Therefore, it's in the S_total = 1/2 subspace.

But is it an eigenstate of total spin? Let's check. Maybe it's symmetric under permutations.

Wait, psi is symmetric under exchange of particles 1,2,3, but with some cyclic permutations? Wait, no, let me see.

Wait, the state is cyclic: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, down1 up2 up3. So it's not fully symmetric, but it's symmetric under certain permutations. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a singlet or triplet state. Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the triplet states have total spin S=1, so multiplicity 3, and singlet state has S=0, multiplicity 1.

But our state has S_z = 1/2, which is not possible for S=0 (since S=0 would have S_z=0). So it's in the triplet subspace, with S=1/2? Wait, no. Wait, total spin S can be 1/2 or 3/2. If it's in the triplet subspace, S=1/2, which would have multiplicity 3, but actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, the triplet state for three particles is a bit different. Wait, no, triplet and singlet refer to two particles. For three particles, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to decompose the Hilbert space into total spin eigenstates. The state psi is in the subspace with S_z = 1/2. But for S_total = 1/2, the maximum S_z is 1/2, so that's compatible. Similarly, for S_total = 3/2, the maximum S_z is 3/2.

So, in the S_total = 1/2 subspace, the states have S_z = 1/2, 0, -1/2, but our state only has S_z = 1/2. Similarly, in the S_total = 3/2 subspace, you can have S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Wait, but the state psi has S_z = 1/2. So, it's either in S_total = 3/2 or S_total = 1/2. But if it's in S_total = 1/2, then it's one of the states with S_z = 1/2. Similarly, in S_total = 3/2, you can have S_z = 1/2.

So to determine if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, I need to see if it's a singlet or not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi and see if it gives a multiple of psi.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check if psi is symmetric under certain permutations.

Wait, S_total^2 is permutation symmetric, so if psi is symmetric under permutations of the particles, then it's an eigenstate. Let me see: if we swap particles 1 and 2 in psi, does it remain the same?

Wait, let me look at the state:

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)

If I swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2 up1 down3, which is same as up1 up2 down3 because the spins are abstract, just labels. Similarly, the second term becomes up2 down1 up3, which is same as down1 up2 up3. The third term becomes down2 up1 up3, which is same as up1 up2 up3? Wait, no, because down2 up1 up3 is a different state.

Wait, actually, no. The third term after swapping 1 and 2 becomes down2 up1 up3, which is equivalent to up1 down2 up3, but that's the second term. So, in fact, swapping 1 and 2 maps psi to itself? Wait, let me see:

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)

After swapping 1 and 2:

psi' = 1/sqrt(3)*(up2 up1 down3 + up2 down1 up3 + down2 up1 up3)

Which is equal to psi because each term is same as in psi.

So yes, psi is symmetric under swapping 1 and 2. Similarly, I think it's also symmetric under swapping 1 and 3, and 2 and 3. Because if you swap 1 and 3:

First term becomes up3 up2 down1, which is same as down1 up2 up3, which is the third term.

Second term becomes up3 down2 up1, which is same as up1 down2 up3, which is the second term.

Third term becomes down3 up2 up1, which is same as up1 up2 down3, which is the first term.

So yes, psi is symmetric under swapping any two particles. Therefore, it's fully symmetric under particle permutations.

Therefore, since S_total^2 commutes with permutations, and psi is symmetric, it is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Therefore, psi is an eigenstate of H.

So then, to compute the eigenvalue, we need to compute the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

Earlier, I had that H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ^2.

So if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi, I can get the eigenvalue of H.

Given that psi is in the S_total = 1/2 subspace, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the eigenvalues, I had two possibilities: (15/4)ħ^2 and (3/4)ħ^2.

So for S_total = 3/2, S_total^2 = (15/4)ħ^2; for S_total = 1/2, S_total^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Given that psi is symmetric, which subspace is it in? If it's in the triplet subspace (S=1/2), then yes, S_total^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

Wait, but wait, is this state in S=1/2 or S=3/2? Since it's symmetric, can it be in S=3/2?

Wait, S_total = 3/2 is antisymmetric? Or symmetric? Wait, actually, no. For three spins, the symmetric states can have S_total = 3/2 or 1/2. The antisymmetric states, but in three particles, the overall symmetry is a bit more involved.

Wait, maybe I can construct the states for S_total = 3/2 and S_total = 1/2.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

The states with S=3/2 are completely symmetric, and the states with S=1/2 are also symmetric, but not completely symmetric. Wait, is that accurate?

Wait, no. In two particles, symmetric states can be triplet (S=1, symmetric) and singlet (S=0, antisymmetric).

But with three particles, the symmetry is different. Actually, the symmetric subspace of three spin-1/2 particles is 3-dimensional, which can be decomposed into symmetric states. The states with S=3/2 is one state (the totally symmetric), and the states with S=1/2 form a 3-dimensional symmetric subspace.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total Hilbert space is 2^3 = 8 dimensional. The symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, while the antisymmetric is 4-dimensional. The decomposition of the symmetric subspace into total spin states is two parts: one is S=3/2 (which is one-dimensional), and the other is S=1/2 (which is three-dimensional). Similarly, the antisymmetric subspace decomposes into S=1/2 and S=3/2.

Wait, so in the symmetric subspace, S=3/2 is one state, and S=1/2 is three states.

Our state psi is in the symmetric subspace, and since it's a combination of three terms, each with two ups and one down, it must be one of the S=1/2 states.

Therefore, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, the eigenvalue of H is (A/2)*(3/4 ħ^2) - (9/8) A ħ^2.

Let me compute that:

First term: (A/2)*(3/4 ħ^2) = (3/8) A ħ^2.

Second term: - (9/8) A ħ^2.

So total energy: (3/8 - 9/8) A ħ^2 = (-6/8) A ħ^2 = (-3/4) A ħ^2.

Wait, but the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ^2. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

I expressed that as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ^2.

But let me verify this:

Given S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, since each S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ^2, the sum is 3*(3/4) ħ^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2 ) = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ^2.

Correct.

Therefore, if psi is in the S_total = 1/2 subspace, then S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

Thus, H psi = (A/2)*(3/4 ħ^2) psi - (9/8) A ħ^2 psi.

Compute that:

(3/8 A ħ^2) psi - (9/8 A ħ^2) psi = (-6/8 A ħ^2) psi = (-3/4 A ħ^2) psi.

Wait, so energy is -3/4 A ħ^2, but the correct answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ^2.

Hmm, so that suggests that perhaps psi is in the S_total = 3/2 subspace, giving a different eigenvalue.

But earlier, we thought that since psi has S_z = 1/2, it can be in S_total = 3/2 or S_total = 1/2.

Wait, but in the S_total = 3/2 subspace, you can have S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. So S_z=1/2 is allowed.

So is psi in S_total = 3/2? Because if it is, then the eigenvalue would be (3/2)(5/2)ħ^2 = 15/4 ħ^2.

But how can I tell?

Maybe I need to compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming the eigenvalue is 3/4 ħ^2.

Wait, let me think differently.

Another approach: for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state is S=0, and the triplets are S=1.

But for three particles, the states are more involved.

Wait, maybe I can make a mistake in the decomposition.

Wait, but in the given state, each term has two spins up and one spin down.

So, if I think of it as a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, perhaps this is a state in the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, but wait, for three particles, the state with two spins up and one spin down can be either S=1/2 or S=3/2, depending on the symmetry.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to compute S_total^2 for psi.

But S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S_total^2 = (9/4) ħ^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (H) = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2.

So, if H psi = [(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2] psi.

But since psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, let's say with eigenvalue S(S+1) ħ^2.

Thus, H psi = [ (S(S+1) ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 ] psi.

So that would be ( (S(S+1) - 9/4 ) / 2 ) A ħ^2 psi.

Hmm, okay, but we still don't know S.

Alternatively, maybe instead of going this way, compute the expectation value of H directly.

Compute <psi| H |psi>.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, <H> = A*( <psi| S1·S2 |psi> + <psi| S1·S3 |psi> + <psi| S2·S3 |psi> )

So, we need to compute the expectation values of each S_i·S_j.

But S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Alternatively, since it's spin 1/2, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_j^+ S_i^- ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But perhaps an easier approach is to note that for spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j in a state can be found using the identity:

S_i·S_j = (1/4)(P_ij), where P_ij is the spin exchange operator, which flips the spins of particles i and j.

But perhaps I can think in terms of the expectation value.

Wait, let's note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

So, the expectation value <psi| S_i·S_j |psi> can be computed by summing the diagonal terms and the off-diagonal terms.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for two spin 1/2 particles, <S_i·S_j> for a singlet state is (-3/4) ħ^2, and for triplet states, it's (1/2) ħ^2. But here, we have three particles. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe for these three-particle states, we can find the expectation value as a sum over pairs.

Wait, but each term in H is a sum over pairs (S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3). So, maybe if I can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j and sum them.

But how?

Let me consider the state psi: 1/sqrt(3)*( up up down + up down up + down up up ).

Let me write the density matrix as |psi><psi|, and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, since it's a symmetric state, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each pair.

But since the state is symmetric under particle exchange, the expectation values for S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 should all be equal.

So, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = <psi| S1·S3 |psi> = <psi| S2·S3 |psi> = same value.

Therefore, let me compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi> and then multiply by 3, and then multiply by A to get <H>.

So, let me compute <S1·S2>.

Given that S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, the expectation is <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/4) <psi| (S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) |psi> + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

Compute each part.

First, compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

S1^z |psi> = S1^z acting on each term.

For each term in psi:

First term: up1 up2 down3. S1^z acts on first spin: up, so +1/2. So S1^z |up1 up2 down3> = (1/2) |up1 up2 down3>.

Similarly, S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = (1/2) |up1 up2 down3>.

Thus, S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = (1/2)(1/2) |up1 up2 down3> = (1/4) |up1 up2 down3>.

Similarly, for the second term: up1 down2 up3. S1^z |up1 down2 up3> = (1/2) |up1 down2 up3>. S2^z |up1 down2 up3> = (-1/2) |up1 down2 up3>. So S1^z S2^z |up1 down2 up3> = (1/2)(-1/2) |up1 down2 up3> = (-1/4) |up1 down2 up3>.

Third term: down1 up2 up3. S1^z |down1 up2 up3> = (-1/2) |down1 up2 up3>. S2^z |down1 up2 up3> = (1/2) |down1 up2 up3>. So S1^z S2^z |down1 up2 up3> = (-1/2)(1/2) |down1 up2 up3> = (-1/4) |down1 up2 up3>.

Therefore, S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/4)|up1 up2 down3> - (1/4)|up1 down2 up3> - (1/4)|down1 up2 up3>.

Therefore, <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/sqrt(3))*(1/4, -1/4, -1/4) dotted with (1/sqrt(3))*(1, -1, -1).

Wait, let me write psi as |a>, |b>, |c>, where:

|a> = |up1 up2 down3>,

|b> = |up1 down2 up3>,

|c> = |down1 up2 up3>.

Then, S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/4)|a> - (1/4)|b> - (1/4)|c>.

Thus, <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3)) * [ (1/4)(1, -1, -1) ].

Dot product: (1/4)[1 -1 -1] = (1/4)(-1) = -1/4.

So <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/sqrt(3))*(1/sqrt(3))*(-1/4) = (1/3)*(-1/4) = -1/12.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(3))(1/sqrt(3)) times the dot product, which is (1/4)(1, -1, -1) · (1, -1, -1) = (1/4)(1 -1 -1) = (1/4)(-1) = -1/4.

Thus, the expectation value is (-1/4)*(1/3) = -1/12.

Wait, no, wait, the inner product is <psi| (S1^z S2^z) |psi> = sum_{i,j} <i| (S1^z S2^z) |j> <j| psi>, but since |psi> is a normalized state, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, actually, S1^z S2^z |psi> is a vector, as computed above, which is (1/4)|a> - (1/4)|b> - (1/4)|c>.

Then, <psi| (S1^z S2^z) |psi> is the sum over the components of |psi> (which are |a>, |b>, |c>) dotted with the components of S1^z S2^z |psi>.

Which is (1/sqrt(3))(1/4, -1/4, -1/4) dotted with (1/4, -1/4, -1/4).

Wait, no, S1^z S2^z |psi> has components (1/4, -1/4, -1/4) in the |a>, |b>, |c> basis.

Thus, the inner product is (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/4, -1/4, -1/4) dotted with (1/sqrt(3))(1, -1, -1).

Wait, perhaps I should think of |psi> as a column vector:

|psi> = (1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3))^T.

Then, S1^z S2^z |psi> is a matrix multiplication:

First, compute S1^z S2^z.

Wait, S1^z is diagonal in the computational basis with eigenvalues +1/2, +1/2, -1/2 for states |a>, |b>, |c> respectively.

Similarly, S2^z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1/2, -1/2, +1/2.

Thus, S1^z S2^z is a diagonal matrix with entries:

For |a>: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4,

For |b>: (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4,

For |c>: (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Thus, S1^z S2^z |psi> is:

(1/4)|a> + (-1/4)|b> + (-1/4)|c>,

which is (1/4, -1/4, -1/4)^T.

Therefore, <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = |psi|^T (S1^z S2^z) |psi>.

Since |psi> is uniform, (1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3)), and (S1^z S2^z)|psi> = (1/4, -1/4, -1/4)^T.

Thus, the dot product is:

(1/sqrt(3))(1/4) + (1/sqrt(3))(-1/4) + (1/sqrt(3))(-1/4) =

(1/4 - 1/4 -1/4)/sqrt(3) = (-1/4)/sqrt(3) = -1/(4 sqrt(3)).

But that can't be right because expectation values should be dimensionless, but this has units.

Wait, no, S1^z S2^z has units of ħ^2, since S_i^z has units of ħ. So S1^z S2^z has units ħ^2, but I think I messed up with the ħ.

Wait, more carefully: spin operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ. So S1^z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, so the matrix elements will have factors of ħ.

Therefore, S1^z S2^z has entries (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ^2/4 for |a>, etc.

Therefore, when I compute S1^z S2^z |psi>, the result is:

(ħ^2/4)|a> - (ħ^2/4)|b> - (ħ^2/4)|c>.

Then, <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> is equal to:

(1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3)) * (ħ^2/4, -ħ^2/4, -ħ^2/4)^T.

Dot product: (1/sqrt(3))(ħ^2/4) + (1/sqrt(3))(-ħ^2/4) + (1/sqrt(3))(-ħ^2/4)

= [ (1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ] ħ^2 / sqrt(3)

= (-1/4) ħ^2 / sqrt(3).

Wait, but this is <S1^z S2^z>, which should have units of ħ^2. So, correct. So this term is (-1/(4 sqrt(3))) ħ^2.

Now, moving on to the next part: <psi| S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ |psi>.

Let's compute S1^+ S2^- and S1^- S2^+ acting on |psi>, then take the inner product with <psi|.

First, S1^+ S2^- |psi>:

Note that S1^+ S2^- = S1^x + i S1^y S2^-.

Wait, more accurately, S1^+ = S1^x + i S1^y,

S2^- = S2^x - i S2^y.

So S1^+ S2^- = (S1^x + i S1^y)(S2^x - i S2^y) = S1^x S2^x - i S1^x S2^y + i S1^y S2^x + S1^y S2^y.

But maybe it's too complicated. Alternatively, since it's spin 1/2, perhaps we can compute the action on the basis states.

Let me recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, S1^+ S2^- |up up> = S1^+ |up> S2^- |up> = 0 * |...> = 0.

Wait, more carefully:

For each term in |psi>, which are up up down, up down up, and down up up, let's apply S1^+ S2^-.

But S1^+ S2^- will act as follows:

For |a> = |up1 up2 down3>,

S1^+ |up1> = 0,

so S1^+ S2^- |a> = S1^+ |up1> S2^- |up2 down3> = 0.

Similarly, for |b> = |up1 down2 up3>,

S2^- |down2> = |down2>,

so S1^+ S2^- |b> = S1^+ |up1> S2^- |down2> = 0 * |...> = 0.

For |c> = |down1 up2 up3>,

S1^+ |down1> = |up1>,

S2^- |up2> = 0,

so S1^+ S2^- |c> = |up1> * 0 = 0.

Thus, S1^+ S2^- |psi> = 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |psi>:

S1^- S2^+ acting on |a> = |up1 up2 down3>,

S2^+ |up2> = 0,

so S1^- S2^+ |a> = S1^- |up1> S2^+ |up2> = 0.

For |b> = |up1 down2 up3>,

S1^- |up1> = |down1>,

S2^+ |up3> = 0,

so S1^- S2^+ |b> = |down1> * 0 = 0.

For |c> = |down1 up2 up3>,

S1^- |down1> = |up1>,


--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, calculate the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall some properties of spin-1/2 particles and their operators. Each spin operator Si has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z, and the total spin operator for each particle is Si = (S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z). The dot product S_i·S_j would then be the sum of the products of their components: S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z.

The Hamiltonian H is a sum of these dot products for each pair: S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. So H is proportional to the sum of the pairwise interactions between the spins.

The state psi is given as an equal superposition of three states: each term has two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, each term has two up arrows and one down arrow, but each down arrow is in a different position. So the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles, I think. It's symmetric because all three permutations are included with equal coefficients.

Since the state is symmetric, perhaps it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator, S_total^2, or the total spin-z operator S_total^z. But wait, the Hamiltonian H is about pairwise interactions. Let me see if I can express H in terms of the total spin operators.

I remember that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be related to the total spin squared. Let me recall the identity:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, rearranging this, we get:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [(S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2

Since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 becomes:

[(S_total)^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²]/2 = [(S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ²]/2

Therefore, H = A * [(S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ²]/2

So H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)

Therefore, the eigenvalue of H will depend on the eigenvalue of S_total^2.

Now, let's think about the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles. The possible total spins can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The state psi has two spins up and one spin down. Let me see what the total spin is.

Alternatively, since the state is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, let me think about how the total spin relates to this.

Wait, the state is given as (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). So each term is a product of two up spins and one down spin, with the down spin in a different position each time. This seems like a symmetric combination of all possible states with two up and one down spin.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible states are:

- All three spins up: (up1 up2 up3), which is one state.

- Two up and one down: There are 3 choose 1 = 3 such states, each with the down spin in a different particle.

- One up and two down: Similarly, 3 choose 1 = 3 states.

- All three spins down: one state.

So in total, 8 states, which is 2^3, as expected.

Our state psi is in the subspace of two up and one down, and it's a symmetric combination of these three states.

Now, let's try to find the total spin of this state.

The total spin S can be either 1/2 or 3/2. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (triplet) or 1/2 (singlet). The singlet state is antisymmetric, but our state is symmetric, so it must belong to a triplet state with S=1/2 or S=3/2.

Wait, actually, for three particles, the possible total spin states can be either S=1/2 or S=3/2. Let me confirm that.

When combining three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be either 3/2 or 1/2. For example, all three aligned gives spin 3/2. If two are aligned and one is opposite, depending on how they combine, the total spin can be 1/2.

But in our case, the state is symmetric and in the two-up, one-down subspace.

So let's figure out whether this symmetric state has total spin 1/2 or 3/2.

An alternative approach is to compute S_total^2 acting on the state psi and see if we can find its eigenvalue.

But perhaps another way is to note that the eigenstates of S_total^2 are the symmetric states for S=3/2 and the antisymmetric states for S=1/2. But wait, in this case, since the state is symmetric, it must be part of the S=3/2 multiplet?

Wait, for three particles, the symmetric states would form the S=3/2 multiplet, which is four-dimensional, and the antisymmetric states form the S=1/2 multiplet, which is three-dimensional. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, that might not be exactly right. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (with multiplicity 2S+1=4) or 1/2 (with multiplicity 2). So the symmetric states are the ones with S=3/2, and the antisymmetric states are those with S=1/2.

But wait, actually, in the case of three particles, the symmetric states are the ones with S=3/2 and the antisymmetric states are with S=1/2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute S_total^2.

Let me think. S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already did that earlier. So H is expressed in terms of S_total^2.

So if we can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 in the state psi, we can plug into H.

So let me try to compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

But wait, S_total^2 is a good quantum number, but since the state psi is in the subspace of two up and one down spins, I need to see if it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the expectation value of S_total^2.

Wait, but to compute the expectation value, let's see. Let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)I, where I is the identity matrix.

Similarly, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed in terms of S_total^2.

We already had that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, plugging in S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ², we have:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)

Therefore, if we can find the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi, we can compute the expectation value of H.

So, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

Since S_total^2 is the square of the total spin, and S_total^2 |psi> = S(S+1)ħ² |psi> if |psi> is in the S-multiplet.

But we need to find whether |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value directly.

Let me note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum Si^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j

So, <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = <psi| sum Si^2 |psi> + 2 <psi| sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j |psi>

Now, the sum of Si^2 is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

The second term is 2 times the sum of the expectation values of S_i·S_j.

So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 [ <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ]

But from the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, the expectation value of H is A * [ <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ]

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2 [ <H>/A ]

Therefore, <H> = ( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ² ) * (A/2)

So, if we can compute <S_total^2>, we can find <H>.

Alternatively, if we can find <S1·S2>, since H is proportional to the sum of these terms.

So, perhaps it's easier to compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

Let me compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) I.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2) <psi| (S1 + S2)^2 |psi> - (3/4) <psi| I |psi>

But (S1 + S2)^2 is S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so it's not helpful. Maybe an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of spin variables.

Each spin is a vector in the Pauli matrices. Let me think about the expectation value.

Alternatively, for spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(I + 2 S_i^z S_j^z - S_i^x S_j^x - S_i^y S_j^y )

Alternatively, perhaps computing the expectation value of S1·S2.

Given that the state psi is symmetric in the particles, let's consider the expectation value.

Wait, each term in psi is two up spins and one down spin. Let me write them out.

The state |psi> is 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each of these three terms has two up spins and one down spin.

So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, I need to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in this state.

Note that S1·S2 is the dot product of the spin operators for particles 1 and 2.

The dot product S1·S2 can be written in terms of their components:

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

We can compute the expectation value for each component separately.

But perhaps it's easier to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state |↑↑⟩ is (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ²? Wait, no.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles in state |↑↑⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 is ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ²? Wait, no.

Actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)I.

So, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑> = (1/2) <↑↑| (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑> - (3/4) <↑↑|↑↑>

Compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑>:

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2

So, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑> = (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑>

Wait, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, for |↑↑⟩, which is the state where both spins are up, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² ?

Wait, no, let's compute it explicitly.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩ is given by:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

In the basis |↑↑⟩, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x is ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ ⟨↑| S2^x |↑⟩.

But S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓⟩, and similarly for S2^x.

So, ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ = -ħ/2, same for S2^x.

Thus, ⟨↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = (-ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = (ħ²)/4

Similarly, ⟨↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑⟩.

But S1^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2) |↓⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^y |↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑⟩ = 0

Same for S1^z S2^z: ⟨↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4

So, putting it all together:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2

Hmm, so that's (1/2)ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓⟩, let's compute ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩.

Compute each component:

S1^x S2^x: ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ = -ħ/2, ⟨↓| S2^x |↓⟩ = -ħ/2

So, ⟨↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = ħ²/4

S1^y S2^y: ⟨↑| S1^y |↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↓| S2^y |↓⟩ = 0, so this term is 0.

S1^z S2^z: ⟨↑| S1^z |↑⟩ = ħ/2, ⟨↓| S2^z |↓⟩ = -ħ/2

So, ⟨↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = ħ²/4 + 0 - ħ²/4 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the singlet state |↑↓ - ↓↑⟩, the expectation value is zero, which makes sense because S1·S2 for the singlet state is ( (0)(0) + something? Wait, no, for singlet state, S_total^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 = (-3/4 ħ²)/2 = -3/8 ħ², but wait, I think I need to check.

Wait, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has total spin S=0, so S_total^2 |singlet> = 0, so then S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = -3/8 ħ².

But the expectation value for S1·S2 in the singlet state is -3/4 ħ² / 2 = -3/8 ħ².

But in the state |↑↓⟩, which is part of the triplet states, the expectation value is, as I computed, (1/2) ħ².

Wait, so for a triplet state (S=1), S1·S2 can take values of (1)(1 + 1)ħ² - something.

Wait, no, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet states (S=1) have expectation value of S1·S2 equal to ( (S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ) ħ² / 2.

Wait, for S=1, S_total^2 = 2ħ², so S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5) ħ² / 2 = 0.5 ħ² / 2 = 0.25 ħ².

Wait, but my direct computation for |↑↑⟩ gave me ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Similarly, let me check |↑↑⟩.

Wait, for |↑↑⟩, which is part of S=1 triplet, I computed ⟨S1·S2⟩ as (1/2) ħ², which is 0.5 ħ².

But according to the formula above, S1·S2 should be (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ², which is 1/4 ħ².

Wait, this discrepancy suggests that my direct computation was wrong.

Wait, hold on. For |↑↑⟩, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

But for |↑↑⟩, S_total^2 is (1)(1 + 1) ħ² = 2ħ².

So, S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

But when I computed it directly, I got 1/2 ħ². There's a conflict here. So perhaps my direct computation was wrong.

Wait, let me recompute S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩.

Compute ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩.

Breaking it down:

⟨↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ ⟨↑| S2^x |↑⟩

As I said earlier, S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ = -ħ/2, same for S2^x.

Thus, ⟨↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = (-ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = ħ²/4

Similarly, ⟨↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑⟩.

Since S1^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^y |↑⟩ = 0. Similarly, ⟨↑| S2^y |↑⟩ = 0. Thus, ⟨↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑⟩ = 0.

⟨↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4.

So, total ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

Wait, but according to the formula, it should be (1/2) ħ²? Or according to the earlier formula, it's (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2

So yes, that's correct.

So for |↑↑⟩, S1 + S2 is S_total = 1, so S_total^2 = 1(1 + 1) ħ² = 2 ħ².

Thus, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

But direct computation gives me 0.5 ħ².

Hmm, so maybe there is a mistake in my direct computation.

Wait, let me re-examine the direct computation.

For S1^x S2^x:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^x |↑⟩ = -ħ/2.

Similarly for S2^x.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = (-ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = ħ²/4.

Similarly, S1^z S2^z:

S1^z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^z |↑⟩ = ħ/2.

Similarly, ⟨↑| S2^z |↑⟩ = ħ/2.

Thus, ⟨↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4.

Now, what about S1^y S2^y?

As before, S1^y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↑| S1^y |↑⟩ = 0, same for S2^y.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| S1^y S2^y |↑↑⟩ = 0.

Thus, total ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

This contradicts the formula, so perhaps my formula is incorrect, or more likely, I messed up the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is correct because:

S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2

So, in |↑↑⟩, (S1 + S2)^2 = S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

So, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2 ħ² = (0.5)/2 ħ²? Wait, no.

Wait, (2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) = (2 - 1.5) = 0.5.

Wait, no, 2 is in units of ħ².

Wait, S1^2 = 3/4 ħ², S2^2 = 3/4 ħ², S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

Thus, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2 ħ² = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5 / 2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

But in direct computation, I got 0.5 ħ². So where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe because S1 and S2 are spin-1/2, so their dot product is in units of ħ².

Wait, S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) I. Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, let me recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (1/4)(S_i^2 + S_j^2)

Wait, correct. Because (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i·S_j

So, S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ] / 2

Thus, in |↑↑⟩, (S1 + S2)^2 = S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

Thus, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (0.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

But according to direct computation, S1·S2 has expectation value 0.5 ħ².

This is a clear inconsistency. So perhaps my direct computation is incorrect.

Wait, let me consider that S1 and S2 are spin-1/2 operators. So, in two dimensions, S1·S2 can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Let me recall that S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i for each spin.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4) (σ1·σ2).

Similarly, σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

So, perhaps, let's compute the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the |↑↑⟩ state.

For |↑↑⟩, σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so ⟨↑| σ1_x |↑⟩ = -1.

Similarly, ⟨↑| σ1_y |↑⟩ = 0, ⟨↑| σ1_z |↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly for σ2.

Thus, ⟨↑↑| σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑⟩ = (-1)(-1) = 1.

⟨↑↑| σ1_y σ2_y |↑↑⟩ = (0)(0) = 0.

⟨↑↑| σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑⟩ = (1)(1) = 1.

Thus, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Thus, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2) = ħ²/2.

So, that's 0.5 ħ², same as before.

But from the other computation, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

In |↑↑⟩, S_total^2 = 2 ħ².

Thus, (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5 / 2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

But according to the Pauli matrix approach, it's 0.5 ħ².

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, actually, the formula S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 is correct for any two particles, so it should hold in |↑↑⟩.

Thus, the formula gives 0.25 ħ², but direct computation says 0.5 ħ².

Wait, this must mean I made a mistake in the direct computation.

Wait, no, the direct computation using Pauli matrices gives 0.5 ħ², while the formula gives 0.25 ħ².

Hmm, perhaps my formula is wrong?

Wait, no, let's double-check.

Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) I.

Wait, perhaps no, let me go back.

Wait, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

Which is correct.

So, if we compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑⟩.

Thus, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = (3/4 + 3/4 + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑⟩.

But (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ is (S_total)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Thus, (3/4 + 3/4 + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Thus, 3/2 + 2 S1·S2 = 2 ħ².

Wait, no, that can't be, because 3/2 is unitless, while the right side is in units of ħ².

Wait, I think I confused the operator dimensions.

Wait, S1·S2 is in units of ħ².

So, S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

All terms have units of ħ².

So, for |↑↑⟩, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Thus, (2 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2 = (2 ħ² - 1.5 ħ² ) / 2 = (0.5 ħ² ) / 2 = 0.25 ħ².

Which is the same as before.

But in Pauli matrix approach, we have 0.5 ħ².

Therefore, either the formula is wrong, which is unlikely, or the Pauli approach is wrong, which is also unlikely.

Wait, perhaps an error in the Pauli approach.

Wait, in the Pauli approach, I said:

S1·S2 = (ħ²/4) (σ1·σ2)

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4) ⟨σ1·σ2⟩

But in |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Thus, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (ħ²/4)(2) = ħ²/2.

But according to the other formula, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 0.25 ħ².

Thus, now I have a conflict. So something is wrong.

Wait, no, maybe when using the Pauli matrices, we have to take into account the actual spin operators. Wait, S1·S2 is indeed (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2), but when acting on |↑↑⟩, maybe the expectation value is not 2.

Wait, let me recast S1·S2.

Wait, let's compute S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩.

As the total spin.

Alternatively, let me consider the eigenstates of S1·S2.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 can be expressed as ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2

Thus, S1·S2 is diagonal in the basis of S_total^2.

Thus, the eigenstates of S1·S2 are the S=1 and S=0 states.

So, for the S=1 state, which is |↑↑⟩, the eigenvalue is (1(1 + 1) - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25 ħ².

Wait, that's 1/4 ħ².

Similarly, for the S=0 state, which is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), the eigenvalue is (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -0.75 ħ².

Wait, so in the |↑↑⟩ state, S1·S2 has expectation value 0.25 ħ².

But why does the Pauli matrix approach give me 0.5 ħ²?

Wait, maybe because in the Pauli approach, the state |↑↑⟩ is not normalized with respect to the spin operators.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are defined with respect to the spin-1/2 systems.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising between the spin operator being ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix, and then the actual operator being S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2). Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ²/4)(<σ1·σ2>).

But in |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 = 2, so expectation value is (ħ²/4)(2) = ħ²/2.

Wait, but according to the other approach, it's 0.25 ħ².

Wait, so which is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps let me plug in the actual expressions.

Let me compute S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩:

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

Now, in |↑↑⟩, S1^z = ħ/2, S2^z = ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z = (ħ²)/4.

Similarly, S1^x and S1^y in |↑⟩ are (ħ/2)|↓⟩ and (iħ/2)|↓⟩ respectively. Similarly for S2^x and S2^y.

Thus, S1^x S2^x |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩ (ħ/2)|↓⟩ = (ħ²)/
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of E. The correct answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*ħ², but I need to see why.

First, let me recall some basics. Spin-1/2 particles have spin operators S_i which are 1/2 times the Pauli matrices for each particle. The total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3. But in this Hamiltonian, H, it's the sum of the dot products of the spins of each pair, so it's S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Wait, but I remember that S_total squared, which is (S1 + S2 + S3)², expands to S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I rearrange that, I can express the sum of the dot products in terms of S_total squared and the individual spins squared.

Let me write that down:

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

So, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2

Which simplifies to H = (A/2)*(S_total² - 3*(S1²)/2) because each S_i squared is (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, hold on, that might not be the right substitution. Let me think again.

Each S_i is a spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, so S_i² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Wait, no, that's if each spin is considered individually. But in reality, when you have a system of multiple spins, each S_i² is indeed (s(s+1))ħ² for each spin. Since each particle is spin 1/2, s=1/2, so S_i² = (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So the sum would be 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

But in the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, from the earlier equation, H = (A/2)*(S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)) = (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

Therefore, H can be written as (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

So, for the state psi, if it's an eigenstate of S_total², then H will act on it by scaling with the eigenvalue. So, we need to check if psi is an eigenstate of S_total².

What is the total spin of this state? Let's look at the state psi. It's a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. The configuration is such that each term has two up spins and one down spin, and all permutations.

Wait, each term is a product state with two ups and one down. So, the total spin would be... Hmm. For each term, the total spin is... Hmm, when two spins are up, S_z is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. But the state is a combination of different permutations, so it's not just one particular spin state. Is this state symmetric under permutation of the spins? It seems so because it's all the permutations of two up and one down.

So, the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, so it must be part of the symmetric representation of the spin state.

Wait, spin states can have total spin S = 2, 1, or 0 in this case, since we're dealing with three spin-1/2 particles. But with two up and one down, maybe it has some particular total spin.

Wait, let me think about how to compute the total spin squared. Let's consider the state psi. Each term in psi is up, up, down in some order. Since all permutations are included, it's symmetric. So, in terms of symmetry, it's symmetric under permutation of particles, so it's in the totally symmetric representation, which is usually associated with the highest possible total spin when the state is symmetric.

So, for three spin-1/2 particles, the maximum total spin is 3*(1/2) = 3/2, but that corresponds to all three spins up. But in this case, since we have two up and one down, the total spin might be 1/2 or 3/2? Wait, no, because in all the terms, we have two up and one down. So, the total spin might be 1/2 or 3/2, but given the state is symmetric, maybe it can be expressed as a combination of different spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S_total squared acting on psi and see what the result is.

But to do that, we need to know S_total squared in terms of the individual spins.

Wait, S_total squared is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But we already have H expressed in terms of S_total squared, so perhaps we can relate H to S_total squared.

Wait, but since H is A times the sum of the dot products, H is (A/2)*(S_total squared - 9/4 ħ²). So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total squared on state psi, then I can find the eigenvalue of H.

So, let me try to compute S_total squared acting on psi.

First, note that S_total squared = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But since we have H expressed in terms of S_total squared, as H = (A/2)(S_total squared - 9/4 ħ²). So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total squared, then H's eigenvalue would be (A/2)(eigenvalue of S_total squared - 9/4 ħ²).

So, let me think about what is the eigenvalue of S_total squared for state psi.

Since each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down, the total spin can be calculated by considering the possible configurations.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the action of S_total squared on psi.

But S_total squared is the total spin squared operator, which can be written as:

S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

But we can also write S_total² in terms of the individual spin operators. So, when acting on a state, S_total² will involve terms that are combinations of S1², S2², S3², and cross terms like S1·S2, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles. The possible total spins are S = 3/2, 1/2. Because when adding three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (all spins aligned) or 1/2.

But wait, in this case, the state psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, does this state have total spin 1/2 or 3/2?

Wait, if all three spins are up, the total spin is 3/2, which is the maximum. But in our case, the state is a combination of two ups and one down. So, perhaps it's a spin 1/2 state.

Wait, but how can we determine the total spin? Maybe by computing the expectation value of S_total squared in the state psi, which will give us the square of the total spin.

So, let me compute <psi| S_total² |psi>.

But S_total squared = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i squared + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

So, the expectation value <psi|S_total²|psi> = <psi|sum S_i squared |psi> + 2 <psi|sum S_i·S_j |psi>.

We can compute this in parts.

First, compute <psi|sum S_i squared |psi>. Since each S_i squared is (3/4)ħ², the sum is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². So, the expectation value of sum S_i squared is 9/4 ħ², regardless of the state.

But wait, actually, is that true? Because S_i squared is an operator that only acts on the spin part of each particle, so when you take the expectation value in the state psi, it's the sum of the expectation values of each S_i squared. Since each S_i has spin 1/2, the expectation value of S_i squared is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = 3/4 ħ² for each particle. So, the total is indeed 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². So that part is straightforward.

Now, the second part is 2 times the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j. So, let's compute <psi|sum S_i·S_j |psi>.

But sum S_i·S_j is equal to (1/2)(sum (S_i + S_j)^2 - sum S_i²). Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, we can write S_i·S_j as (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

So, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is the sum of the expectations of each component.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 individually, then sum them up.

Let me denote:

E_ij = <psi| S_i·S_j |psi> for i ≠ j.

So, sum E_ij = E_12 + E_13 + E_23.

So, let's compute E_12 first.

E_12 = <psi| S1·S2 |psi>

Since S1 and S2 act on particles 1 and 2 respectively, we can write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1² + S2²)/2

Wait, because (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = [(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2²]/2

So, E_12 = <psi| [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ] / 2 |psi>

Since S1² and S2² are constants, as they are spin-1/2 particles, their expectation values are known.

Thus, E_12 = [ <psi| (S1 + S2)^2 |psi> - <psi| S1² |psi> - <psi| S2² |psi> ] / 2

We already know that <psi| S1² |psi> = 3/4 ħ² and same for S2², so that part is done.

Now, we need to compute <psi| (S1 + S2)^2 |psi>.

Expanding this, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Wait, but that just brings us back to where we started. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the action of S1·S2 on the state psi.

Since psi is a symmetric combination of states with two up and one down, let's represent psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term in psi is a product state with two up spins and one down spin.

Let me write out the action of S1·S2 on each term.

Note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). The expectation value for each term is the same because of symmetry.

So, let's compute <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩

First, S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2) |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2) |↑↑↓⟩

So, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩

Now, what about S1^x and S2^x? S1^x flips spin 1, S2^x flips spin 2.

Similarly, S1^y and S2^y are complex conjugates of S1^x and S2^x, respectively.

But when we take the expectation value <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩, it's the same as the probability of transitioning from |↑↑↓⟩ to |↓↓↑⟩ under the action of S1^x S2^x.

But wait, S1^x acting on |↑↑↓⟩ would give (|↓⟩|↑↑⟩), and S2^x acting on the same would give (|↑↑⟩|↓⟩). So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩ (1/2) * |↑↑⟩ (1/2) ?

Wait, no. Let's be precise.

S1^x applied to |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)|↓⟩|↑↑⟩.

Similarly, S2^x applied to |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)|↑↑⟩|↓⟩.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)|↓↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↓↑↓⟩

So, the inner product <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/4) <↑↑↓| ↓↑↓⟩.

But that's zero because the first spin is up in the bra, and the ket has the first spin down.

Similarly, the same logic applies for the other terms:

<↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, <↑↑↓| S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

So, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y on |↑↑↓⟩ is zero.

Thus, E_12 contribution from S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y is zero.

Only the S1^z S2^z contributes, which is 1/4.

Therefore, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 1/4.

Similarly, each term in psi will have the same expectation value when acting with S1·S2, S1·S3, etc., due to the symmetry.

So, let's compute E_12.

Since psi is a symmetric combination of |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩, each of these three terms contributes equally.

So, the expectation value E_12 is the average of the expectation values of S1·S2 for each term. Each term has E_12 = 1/4. So, since there are three terms, each contributing 1/4, the total expectation is 3*(1/4)*(1/3) = 1/4.

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, when we compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, it's the sum over all the components in psi.

But since psi is (1/sqrt(3))( |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ ), then |psi⟩ is a sum of |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ each with coefficient 1/sqrt(3). So, when we compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, it's (1/3)( <a| + <b| + <c| ) S1·S2 ( |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ )

Which is (1/3)( <a|S1·S2|a⟩ + <a|S1·S2|b⟩ + <a|S1·S2|c⟩ + <b|S1·S2|a⟩ + <b|S1·S2|b⟩ + <b|S1·S2|c⟩ + <c|S1·S2|a⟩ + <c|S1·S2|b⟩ + <c|S1·S2|c⟩ )

But due to the orthonormality of the basis states, cross terms where the bra and ket are different will be zero, since |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ are orthogonal. So, only the diagonal terms remain.

Thus, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3)( <a|S1·S2|a⟩ + <b|S1·S2|b⟩ + <c|S1·S2|c⟩ )

Each of these terms <a|S1·S2|a⟩ is 1/4, as we computed earlier.

Therefore, each term is 1/4, so the sum is 3*(1/4)*(1/3) = 1/4.

Wait, but wait, if each of the three states |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ has <a|S1·S2|a⟩ = 1/4, then the total expectation is (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4)/3? No, no, wait, the expectation is (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) * (1/3), since each term is multiplied by 1/3.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The state psi is (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3). So, when we compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, it's equal to [ (⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c| ) (S1·S2) (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩) ] / 3

Which is equal to [ ⟨a|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨a|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨a|S1·S2|c⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨b|S1·S2|c⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|a⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|b⟩ + ⟨c|S1·S2|c⟩ ] / 3

But since the states |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ are orthogonal, the cross terms (like ⟨a| S1·S2 |b⟩) are zero.

Therefore, only the terms <a|S1·S2|a⟩, <b|S1·S2|b⟩, <c|S1·S2|c⟩ remain. Each of these is 1/4, so the total expectation is (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) / 3? Wait, no. Wait, each <a|S1·S2|a⟩ is 1/4, so adding them together gives 3*(1/4) = 3/4. Then, divided by 3, gives 1/4.

So, yes, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = 1/4 ħ².

Similarly, what about <psi| S1·S3 |psi> and <psi| S2·S3 |psi>?

By the same reasoning, due to the symmetry of the state psi, each of these expectation values will also be 1/4 ħ².

Therefore, sum E_ij = E_12 + E_13 + E_23 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4 ħ².

Wait, that seems off. Let me confirm.

Wait, if each S_i·S_j has expectation value 1/4 ħ², then the sum is 3*(1/4 ħ²) = 3/4 ħ².

So, putting it together, the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j is 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H is:

<psi| H |psi> = A * (sum E_ij ) = A * (3/4 ħ² )

But wait, no, let me check:

Wait, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so the expectation value is A times the sum of E_ij, which is 3*(1/4 ħ²) = 3/4 ħ², so the expectation value is (3/4) A ħ².

But the correct answer is supposed to be (2/3) A ħ².

Wait, so either I'm making a mistake or my approach is wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation.

First, when computing <a| S1·S2 |a⟩, we found it to be 1/4 ħ². Similarly for the others.

But let's compute it again.

Given |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, then:

S1^z |a⟩ = (1/2)|a⟩

Similarly, S2^z |a⟩ = (1/2)|a⟩

So, S1^z S2^z |a⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)|a⟩ = 1/4 |a⟩

Now, what about S1^x S2^x |a⟩?

S1^x is (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓|)/2, same for S2^x. So, S1^x S2^x acting on |↑↑↓⟩ would flip the first spin to down and the second spin to down.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↑| |↑⟩⟨↑| ) + similar terms? Wait, actually, it's (S1^x S2^x) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(|↓⟩|↑↑⟩ + |↑⟩|↓↑⟩ ) / 2 ?

Wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

S1^x S2^x = (S1^x)(S2^x) = (1/2)(|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓|) (1/2)(|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| )

So, multiplying them together, we get four terms:

(1/4)(|↓⟩⟨↑| |↓⟩⟨↑| + |↓⟩⟨↑| |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↑⟩⟨↓| |↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| |↑⟩⟨↓| )

Simplify each term:

First term: |↓↓⟩⟨↑↑|.

Second term: |↓↑⟩⟨↑↓|.

Third term: |↑↓⟩⟨↓↑|.

Fourth term: |↑↑⟩⟨↓↓|.

But when we take the inner product ⟨↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩, most terms will vanish because of orthogonality.

⟨↑↑↓| first term: ⟨↑↑↓| ↓↓⟩ = 0.

Second term: ⟨↑↑↓| ↓↑⟩ = 0, because the first spin is up in the bra, down in the ket.

Third term: ⟨↑↑↓| ↑↓⟩ = 0, because the second spin is up in bra, down in ket.

Fourth term: ⟨↑↑↓| ↑↑⟩ = 1, because the spins match. But wait, the fourth term is |↑↑⟩⟨↓↓|, but in our state |↑↑↓⟩, the third spin is down. So, ⟨↑↑↓| ↑↑⟩ is 1, but multiplied by ⟨↓↓| ↓↓⟩? Wait, no, that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the operator application.

Wait, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = ( |↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) ( |↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) / 4 * |↑↑↓⟩ ?

No, perhaps a different approach. Let's think of S1^x and S2^x as acting on each spin.

When S1^x acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it flips the first spin to down, giving |↓↑↓⟩. Similarly, S2^x flips the second spin, giving |↑↓↓⟩.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ * S2^x |↑↑↓⟩?

No, that's not the case because S1^x and S2^x don't commute. Actually, since they're tensor products, it's (S1^x ⊗ S2^x) acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

So, (S1^x ⊗ S2^x) |↑↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↑| ⊗ |↓⟩⟨↑| ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no. Let me recall that for spin-1/2 particles, S^x = (|+⟩⟨-| + |−⟩⟨+|)/2, or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's better to remember that S^x has matrix representation, but maybe we can think of it in terms of spin states.

Wait, actually, S^x |↑⟩ = (|→⟩ + |←⟩)/2, but in terms of computational basis, |↑⟩ is (1,0), and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So, S^x |↑⟩ = 1/2 (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩ ), but that can't be right because S^x acting on |↑⟩ is (|↓⟩ + |↑⟩)/2. Wait, actually, S^x in terms of Pauli matrices is (ħ/2) σ_x.

But perhaps another approach: since S1^x and S2^x are Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)( |↓⟩ |↑↑⟩ ) + (ħ/2)|↑⟩ ( |↓⟩ |↑⟩ )? Wait, no, that seems confused.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ directly, let me note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z )

So, since we've already determined that <↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

What about S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y?

For spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x in a product state |↑↑⟩ is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4, but in our case, the state is |↑↑↓⟩, so the spins are entangled because of the down spin.

Wait, no, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are both up, and particle 3 is down.

But the operator S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, so it's (S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1·S2)|↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ = ( (3/4)I ) |↑↑⟩ |↓⟩ = (3/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, that's a key point! Since S1 and S2 are spin-1/2 particles, their dot product S1·S2 is (3/4) ħ² times the identity operator on particles 1 and 2, regardless of their state, because S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ). Each component is (ħ/2)^2 times the identity, so together they add up to (3/4) ħ² I.

Wait, that seems correct because S_i·S_j for two spin-1/2 particles is (3/4) ħ² times the identity.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, in the state |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, <a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion where I thought it was 1/4.

Wait, which is correct?

I think this is correct because S1·S2 is the same for any two spin-1/2 particles. The expectation value of S1·S2 in any state where particles 1 and 2 are spin-1/2 is (3/4) ħ². Wait, is that true?

Wait, no. Because S1·S2 is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ). For a product state |↑↑⟩, each component S1^z S2^z contributes (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 ħ², and the other components average to zero because of symmetry. So, the expectation value is 1/4 ħ².

Wait, but in the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1 and S2 are both up, so S1^z S2^z contributes 1/4 ħ², but what about S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y?

Wait, in the product state |↑↑↓⟩, the spins of 1 and 2 are up, so when we apply S1^x S2^x, which is (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) ⊗ (|↓⟩⟨↑| + |↑⟩⟨↓| ) / 4, acting on |↑↑↓⟩, we get terms like |↓↓↓⟩, |↑↓↓⟩, etc., but when we take the inner product with |↑↑↓⟩, it's zero because the first term |↓↓↓⟩ is orthogonal, and the second term |↑↓↓⟩ has different spins. Wait, no, in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the third spin is down, so |↑↓↓⟩ would have the third spin down as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of S1^x S2^x in |↑↑↓⟩.

But maybe a better approach is to compute S1·S2 acting on a state where the first two spins are up.

So, S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑⟩.

Wait, that's the key. Because for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 is (3/4) ħ² times the identity. Therefore, when acting on any state, it just scales it by 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is (3/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩, the same applies.

Therefore, each term in psi has expectation value 3/4 ħ² when S1·S2 is applied.

But wait, that contradicts the earlier computation.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier when considering the cross terms. Let me think again.

So, if S1·S2 is (3/4) ħ² I for the first two spins, regardless of the state, then when acting on |a⟩, S1·S2 |a⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |a⟩.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |a⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, <b| S1·S2 |b⟩ = (3/4) ħ², and <c| S1·S2 |c⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Thus, when we compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we get:

(1/3)( <a| + <b| + <c| ) S1·S2 ( |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ )

Which becomes (1/3)(3/4 ħ² + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3/4 ħ² + 0 + 0 + 3/4 ħ² + 0 )

Wait, no, because S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, so |b⟩ and |c⟩ are different states where S1·S2 may or may not act.

Wait, no, S1·S2 acts on the first two spins regardless of the third spin.

Wait, let's clarify: when we take the inner product <b| S1·S2 |b⟩, |b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩. So, S1·S2 acting on this state is (3/4) ħ² |↑↓↑⟩, because S1·S2 acts only on spins 1 and 2, which are ↑ and ↓, respectively.

Therefore, <b| S1·S2 |b⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, <c| S1·S2 |c⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, each of the three terms in the sum has expectation value 3/4 ħ², so the total is (1/3)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) = (1/3)(9/4 ħ²) = 3/4 ħ².

Similarly, each of the cross terms
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given spin state ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. The state ψ is provided as ψ = (1/√3)*(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃). 

First, I need to recall some properties of spin operators. For spin 1/2 particles, each spin operator S_i can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. The inner product S_i · S_j can be expanded as (1/4)(σ_i · σ_j), where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. But I also remember that S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+), but that might not be directly helpful here. Instead, it's more useful to note that for spin-1/2 systems, S_i · S_j = (1/4)(I⊗I⊗I + ... terms for each Pauli matrix). Actually, maybe it's better to use the identity that S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + (S_i^z S_j^z). Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another way: There is a formula that says S_i · S_j = (1/2)(I⊗I⊗I + σ_i σ_j) / 2 or something similar? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the total spin operator. The total spin squared operator is (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). So from that, we can write S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ = [ (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 - (S₁² + S₂² + S₃²) ] / 2.

Since each S_i² is (ℏ/2)(ℏ/2 + 1) for spin 1/2. So S_i² = (3/4)ℏ² for each particle. Therefore, S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = 3*(3/4)ℏ² = (9/4)ℏ².

So then, plugging into the expression for H:

H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃) = A*[ ( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ℏ² ) / 2 ].

Hence, H = A*(S_total² - (9/4)ℏ²)/2.

So H = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8) ℏ².

Therefore, to find the eigenvalue of H, I need to find the eigenvalue of S_total² for the state ψ.

So the first step is to compute S_total² acting on ψ. But first, let's figure out the total spin of the state ψ.

Given that ψ is a symmetric state under certain permutations? Wait, let's look at ψ: it's a sum of three terms, each with two up spins and one down spin, but in different positions. Specifically, in the first term, particle 1 and 2 are up, particle 3 is down; in the second, particles 1 and 3 are up, particle 2 is down; and in the third, particles 2 and 3 are up, particle 1 is down.

So this state is symmetric in the sense that it's a sum of all possible configurations where two spins are up and one is down. So perhaps this is a state with total spin S = 1? Because for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. But this state is symmetric under permutation, so maybe it has total spin S = 1, since it's a triplet state.

Wait, but wait, if all three spins are up, that's S=3/2. But this state is different. Let me think: For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The singlet state (all spins down) has total spin 0. The triplets have total spin 1/2 or 3/2? Wait, no, wait: For two particles, the total spin can be 0 or 1. For three particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Wait, actually, no. The total spin S for three spin-1/2 particles can be S=3/2 or S=1/2. The singlet state for three particles would be S=0, but that requires all three spins to be paired in some way, like down, down, down. But our state ψ is not that.

In our case, ψ has two spins up and one spin down in each term. So that suggests that in each term, the total spin is S=1/2. But when you add them together, you get a symmetric state.

Wait, but is the state ψ symmetric under permutation? Let's check. If we swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes ↑₂↑₁↓₃ which is the same as the first term. The second term becomes ↑₂↓₁↑₃ which is the same as the third term. The third term becomes ↓₂↑₁↑₃ which is the same as the second term. So yes, the state is symmetric under permutation of the spins, so it's a symmetric spin state.

In the case of three spin-1/2 particles, symmetric spin states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2. The state ψ is a symmetric state, so it must be part of the S=3/2 representation or the S=1/2 representation. But ψ is a superposition of three states, each with two up and one down spin. Let me see: Each term in ψ has two up spins and one down spin, which can be thought of as part of the S=1/2 triplet. But wait, the triplet for each pair of spins is S=1/2, but when considering all three spins together, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total spin squared operator S_total² for the state ψ.

So S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃).

We already know that S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = (9/4)ℏ².

So S_total² = (9/4)ℏ² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃).

But H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃), so S_total² = (9/4)ℏ² + 2H/A.

Hence, H = (S_total² - (9/4)ℏ²)/2.

Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² for ψ, I can find the eigenvalue of H.

So let me compute S_total² |ψ>.

First, note that each term in ψ is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, each multiplied by 1/√3.

So |ψ> = (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ).

Now, let's compute S_total² |ψ>.

But S_total² is a sum of squares and cross terms. So let's write out S_total² as:

S_total² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃).

So when we apply S_total² to |ψ>, it's the sum of applying S₁², S₂², S₃², and the cross terms. But since S₁², S₂², S₃² act on each spin individually, they will just give 3/4 ℏ² for each term. However, since |ψ> is a symmetric state, perhaps these terms can be simplified.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to note that S_total² is a Casimir operator, and for the state |ψ>, which has a certain total spin, S_total² will act on it with eigenvalue S(S+1)ℏ².

So, if I can determine the total spin S of |ψ>, then S_total² |ψ> = S(S+1)ℏ² |ψ>.

So is |ψ> an eigenstate of S_total²? That depends on whether |ψ> has a definite total spin S.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ⟨ψ| S_total² |ψ⟩ to find the expectation value of S_total², and then from that find the expectation value of H.

But the initial question is whether |ψ> is an eigenstate of H. If it's an eigenstate of S_total², then since H is linear in S_total², it would be an eigenstate of H as well.

So let's try to see whether |ψ> is an eigenstate of S_total².

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S_total² |ψ> and see if it's proportional to |ψ>.

Let me attempt that.

First, let's compute S_total² |ψ> = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 |ψ> = (S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃)) |ψ>.

Now, since each S_i² acts on each term in |ψ>, let's compute S₁² |↑↑↓⟩, S₂² |↑↑↓⟩, etc.

But since the state is symmetric, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since each term in |ψ> is a state with two spins up and one spin down, let's compute S_total² acting on each term.

But maybe it's better to note that for each individual term, say |↑↑↓⟩, the action of S_total² can be computed as follows.

But wait, |↑↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate of S_total², right? Because flipping a spin can change the state. Hmm, but perhaps I can express S_total² in terms of the z-components and the raising and lowering operators.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the eigenvalues of S_total² in terms of the multiplicity of the state.

Wait, let's think about the possible eigenstates of S_total². For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

The eigenstates with S = 3/2 have total spin S = 3/2, and the eigenstates with S = 1/2 have S = 1/2.

Our state |ψ> is symmetric, so it must lie in the S = 3/2 or S = 1/2 representations.

If |ψ> is in the S = 3/2 representation, then S_total² |ψ> = (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ℏ² |ψ> = (15/4)ℏ² |ψ>.

If it's in the S = 1/2 representation, then S_total² |ψ> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ² |ψ> = (3/4)ℏ² |ψ>.

So, which is it?

To figure this out, let's try to compute S_total² |ψ>.

Alternatively, perhaps compute ⟨ψ| S_total² |ψ⟩, which would give us the expectation value ⟨S_total²⟩.

Since |ψ> is a symmetric state, perhaps we can compute this expectation value using combinatorial arguments.

Each term in |ψ> is a state with two up spins and one down spin. Let's denote the states as |a b c⟩ where a, b, c ∈ {↑, ↓}, with ↑ = +1 and ↓ = -1.

Then, |ψ> = (1/√3)(|+++--⟩ + |++-+⟩ + |+-++⟩), but actually, let me correct that: Each term has two up spins and one down spin, so in terms of spins, it's |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, each with coefficient 1/√3.

So, to compute ⟨S_total²⟩, we can compute the average of S_total² over these three states.

But S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃).

We know that S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = 3*(3/4)ℏ² = 9/4 ℏ².

Now, let's compute the expectation value of S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃.

Each term S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

So, the expectation value of S_i·S_j for a given state is:

⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ + (1/2)(⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ + ⟨S_i^- S_j^+⟩).

Let's compute each of these terms for the state |ψ>.

First, let's note that in each term of |ψ>, there are two ↑ and one ↓.

So, for each term in |ψ>, say |↑↑↓⟩, the spins are ↑, ↑, ↓. So, S_i^z for each particle:

S₁^z = +1/2, S₂^z = +1/2, S₃^z = -1/2.

Similarly for other terms. Since the state is symmetric, the expectation values will be the same across all permutations.

So, let's compute ⟨S₁^z S₂^z⟩ for |ψ>.

Each term in |ψ> has S₁^z = +1/2, S₂^z = +1/2, S₃^z = -1/2 in the first term, and similar permutations in the other terms.

So, for each term, S₁^z S₂^z = (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4.

Similarly, for other terms, S₁^z S₂^z will be +1/4, because each pair of spins is either both up or one up and one down, but wait no, in the first term, S₁ and S₂ are both up, so +1/4, but in the second term, S₁ is up, S₂ is down: S₁^z S₂^z = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4, and same for the third term, S₁ is down, S₂ is up: (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Wait, but wait, no: Wait, in each term, the two up spins are in different positions. For example, in the first term, S₁ and S₂ are up; in the second, S₁ and S₃ are up; in the third, S₂ and S₃ are up. So for each term, the two up spins are different particles.

Therefore, for each term, S_i^z S_j^z where i and j are the two up spins will be (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4. However, in each term, S_i^z S_j^z for the two up spins is +1/4, but for the other pairs (one up and one down), it's (±1/2)(∓1/2) = -1/4.

Wait, but in the state |ψ>, each term has two up spins and one down spin, so for each term, there are three pairs:

For the first term, |↑↑↓⟩:

- S₁·S₂: both up, so (1/2)(1/2) = +1/4.

- S₁·S₃: one up, one down, so (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

- S₂·S₃: same as above, -1/4.

Similarly, for the second term, |↑↓↑⟩:

- S₁·S₂: one up, one down, so -1/4.

- S₁·S₃: both up, +1/4.

- S₂·S₃: one up, one down, -1/4.

Third term, |↓↑↑⟩:

- S₁·S₂: one down, one up, -1/4.

- S₁·S₃: both up, +1/4.

- S₂·S₃: both up, +1/4.

So, for each term, the expectation of S_i·S_j is:

For the first term: (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) = -1/4.

Wait, no, actually, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ for each term is the expectation value of S_i·S_j in that term.

So, for the first term, |↑↑↓⟩:

⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

⟨S₁·S₃⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

⟨S₂·S₃⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Similarly, for the second term, |↑↓↑⟩:

⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

⟨S₁·S₃⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

⟨S₂·S₃⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Third term, |↓↑↑⟩:

⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

⟨S₁·S₃⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

⟨S₂·S₃⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Now, when we take the average over the three terms, each of the three terms is multiplied by 1/√3 and then we sum them, so the expectation value is the average of these three terms.

So, for S₁·S₂:

First term: +1/4.

Second term: -1/4.

Third term: -1/4.

Average: (1/4 -1/4 -1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Similarly for S₁·S₃:

First term: -1/4.

Second term: +1/4.

Third term: -1/4.

Average: (-1/4 +1/4 -1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Same for S₂·S₃:

First term: -1/4.

Second term: -1/4.

Third term: +1/4.

Average: (-1/4 -1/4 +1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

So, the expectation value of S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ is 3*(-1/12) = -1/4.

But wait, each term S_i·S_j has expectation value -1/12, so sum is 3*(-1/12) = -1/4.

Therefore, the expectation value of S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ is -1/4 (in units of ℏ²/4? Wait, wait, no, because S_i·S_j actually has units of ℏ², since each S_i has units of ℏ/2.

Wait, actually, each S_i is (ℏ/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (ℏ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j). Therefore, S_i·S_j has units of ℏ².

But the expectation value ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ is in units of ℏ², but in our previous computation, we treated S_i·S_j as in units of 1/4 (since S_i·S_j = (1/4)ℏ² (σ_i·σ_j)), so perhaps I should include the ℏ² factor.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to write S_i·S_j = (ℏ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j). Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ℏ²/4) ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩.

So, in our computation above, we found that ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = -1/3 for each pair (i,j), but wait, no: Wait, in our calculation, we computed ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ as:

For each pair (i,j), the average of ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ over the three terms was -1/3.

Wait, no, actually, in the computation above, we calculated ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ as -1/12 in units of ℏ²/4.

Wait, no, perhaps I confused the units.

Wait, let's step back.

Each S_i is (ℏ/2) σ_i^{z}, so S_i^z = (ℏ/2) σ_i^{z}.

Similarly, S_i·S_j = (ℏ²/4)(σ_i^x σ_j^x + σ_i^y σ_j^y + σ_i^z σ_j^z).

Therefore, when we compute ⟨S_i·S_j⟩, it's equal to (ℏ²/4) ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩.

In our earlier computation, for each pair (i,j), the average of ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ over the three terms was -1/3, because for each pair, the average was -1/4 divided by (1/4), but wait, no.

Wait, no, in our previous calculation, for each term in |ψ>, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ was either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins were aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify.

Each S_i·S_j = (ℏ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j), so in our earlier computation, we computed ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ as (ℏ²/4) * expectation of σ_i·σ_j.

In the first term, |↑↑↓⟩:

- ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = (↑↑) = +1, because σ_i^z σ_j^z = +1.

- ⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩ = (↑↓) = -1.

- ⟨σ₂·σ₃⟩ = (↑↓) = -1.

Similarly, in the second term, |↑↓↑⟩:

- ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = (↑↓) = -1.

- ⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩ = (↑↑) = +1.

- ⟨σ₂·σ₃⟩ = (↓↑) = -1.

Third term, |↓↑↑⟩:

- ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = (↓↑) = -1.

- ⟨σ₁·σ₃⟩ = (↓↑) = -1.

- ⟨σ₂·σ₃⟩ = (↑↑) = +1.

So, for each term, the average of σ_i·σ_j for each pair is:

For (1,2):

First term: +1.

Second term: -1.

Third term: -1.

Average: (1 -1 -1)/3 = (-1)/3.

Similarly, for (1,3):

First term: -1.

Second term: +1.

Third term: -1.

Average: (-1 +1 -1)/3 = (-1)/3.

Same for (2,3):

First term: -1.

Second term: -1.

Third term: +1.

Average: (-1 -1 +1)/3 = (-1)/3.

Therefore, the expectation value of σ_i·σ_j for each pair is -1/3.

Thus, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ℏ²/4) * (-1/3) = -ℏ²/12.

Therefore, the sum S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ has expectation value 3*(-ℏ²/12) = -ℏ²/4.

Now, going back to H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃), so ⟨H⟩ = A*(-ℏ²/4).

But wait, the given correct answer is that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3) A ℏ². So that suggests that I might have made a mistake.

Wait, but according to this, the expectation value is negative, which contradicts the given answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_total² instead.

Since S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2 = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃).

We already know that S₁² + S₂² + S₃² = 3*(3/4)ℏ² = 9/4 ℏ².

From earlier, we have S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ has expectation value -ℏ²/4.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = (9/4 ℏ²) + 2*(-ℏ²/4) = (9/4 - 2/4)ℏ² = (7/4)ℏ².

But wait, that can't be, because S_total² must be greater than or equal to S(S+1)ℏ², which is either (3/2)(5/2)ℏ² = 15/4 ℏ² or (1/2)(3/2)ℏ² = 3/4 ℏ².

But 7/4 ℏ² is between these, so the state is not an eigenstate of S_total², meaning it's not an eigenstate of H either.

But this contradicts the given correct answer, which says it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3 A ℏ².

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Wait, let's try this again.

Each term in |ψ> is (1/√3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ).

For each pair (i,j), how many terms in |ψ> have σ_i = σ_j?

In |↑↑↓⟩, (1,2) are both up, (1,3) is up and down, (2,3) is up and down.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, (1,3) are both up, (1,2) is up and down, (2,3) is down and up.

In |↓↑↑⟩, (2,3) are both up, (1,2) is down and up, (1,3) is down and up.

So, for each pair (i,j), how many terms have σ_i = σ_j?

For (1,2):

- In |↑↑↓⟩: yes.

- In |↑↓↑⟩: no.

- In |↓↑↑⟩: no.

So only 1 term out of 3.

Similarly, for (1,3):

- In |↑↑↓⟩: no.

- In |↑↓↑⟩: yes.

- In |↓↑↑⟩: no.

Again, 1 term.

Same for (2,3):

- In |↑↑↓⟩: no.

- In |↑↓↑⟩: no.

- In |↓↑↑⟩: yes.

Again, 1 term.

So, for each pair (i,j), the expectation value of σ_i·σ_j is +1 in 1 term, -1 in 2 terms.

Therefore, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = (1 -1 -1)/3 = -1/3.

So, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(-1/3) = -ℏ²/12.

Therefore, summing over all three pairs: 3*(-ℏ²/12) = -ℏ²/4, as before.

Thus, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2*(-ℏ²/4) = 9/4 ℏ² - 1/2 ℏ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ℏ² = 7/4 ℏ².

But 7/4 ℏ² is equal to (2.75) ℏ², which is between 3/4 ℏ² (for S=1/2) and 15/4 ℏ² (for S=3/2). This suggests that the state |ψ> is not an eigenstate of S_total², hence not an eigenstate of H.

But this contradicts the given correct answer that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)A ℏ², which would imply that ⟨H⟩ = (2/3) A ℏ².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing ⟨S_total²⟩.

Wait, let's compute ⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨(S₁ + S₂ + S₃)^2⟩ = ⟨S₁²⟩ + ⟨S₂²⟩ + ⟨S₃²⟩ + 2⟨S₁·S₂⟩ + 2⟨S₁·S₃⟩ + 2⟨S₂·S₃⟩.

We know that ⟨S₁²⟩ = ⟨S₂²⟩ = ⟨S₃²⟩ = (3/4)ℏ² each, so total 9/4 ℏ².

⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = ⟨S₁·S₃⟩ = ⟨S₂·S₃⟩ = -ℏ²/12 each, so 3*(-ℏ²/12) = -ℏ²/4.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 9/4 ℏ² + 2*(-ℏ²/4) = 9/4 ℏ² - 1/2 ℏ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ℏ² = 7/4 ℏ².

But 7/4 ℏ² is not an eigenvalue of S_total², because for S=3/2, it's 15/4 ℏ², and for S=1/2, it's 3/4 ℏ².

Thus, |ψ> is not an eigenstate of S_total², hence not an eigenstate of H.

But the correct answer states that it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3) A ℏ². So either I'm missing something or there's an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the state |ψ> is a symmetric state, which could mean that it's part of the S=1 representation. For three spin-1/2 particles, the S=1 representation has dimension 3, which matches the number of terms in |ψ>. Therefore, perhaps |ψ> is indeed an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S(S+1)ℏ² = 2ℏ².

Wait, but S=1, so S(S+1) = 2, so S_total² |ψ> = 2ℏ² |ψ>.

But in our calculation, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 7/4 ℏ², which is less than 2ℏ². So that seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |ψ> is in the S=1 representation, but with a different normalization.

Wait, let's check the normalization. The state |ψ> has 3 terms, each with coefficient 1/√3, so the norm is 3*(1/√3)^2 = 3*(1/3) = 1. So it's normalized.

But in the S=1 representation, the singlet state (all spins down) would have S=0, and the triplet states would have S=1.

The triplet states are symmetric and have two spins up and one spin down in different positions. So |ψ> is indeed one of the triplet states with S=1.

Therefore, if |ψ> is part of the S=1 triplet, then S_total² |ψ> = (1)(1+1)ℏ² |ψ> = 2ℏ² |ψ>.

But our earlier calculation gave ⟨S_total²⟩ = 7/4 ℏ², which is not 2ℏ². There must be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Let me re-examine that.

Each S_i·S_j = (ℏ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j). Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ℏ²/4)⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩.

In |ψ>, for each pair (i,j), there is one term where σ_i and σ_j are both up (so +1), and two terms where they are opposite (so -1).

Therefore, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = (1 -1 -1)/3 = (-1)/3.

Thus, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ℏ²/4)(-1/3) = -ℏ²/12.

So, sum over all pairs: 3*(-ℏ²/12) = -ℏ²/4.

Then, ⟨S_total²⟩ = ⟨S₁²⟩ + ⟨S₂²⟩ + ⟨S₃²⟩ + 2⟨S₁·S₂⟩ + 2⟨S₁·S₃⟩ + 2⟨S₂·S₃⟩.

Which is 3*(3/4 ℏ²) + 2*(-ℏ²/4) = 9/4 ℏ² - 1/2 ℏ² = 7/4 ℏ².

But wait, if |ψ> is in the S=1 representation, S_total² |ψ> should be 2ℏ² |ψ>, so the expectation value should be 2ℏ². But according to the computation, it's 7/4 ℏ².

This discrepancy suggests that I must have made a mistake in assuming that |ψ> is in the S=1 representation.

Alternatively, perhaps |ψ> is not in the S=1 representation but in S=1/2.

Wait, but |ψ> is symmetric, and symmetric states with three particles can have S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states are in the S=3/2 and S=1/2 representations. The S=3/2 representation has dimension 5, and S=1/2 has dimension 3.

Since |ψ> has three terms, it could be in the S=1/2 representation.

Wait, but the S=1/2 representation for three particles is a bit more complicated. Let me think about the possible total spin.

Wait, perhaps I should construct the states for S=1/2.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

The S=3/2 representation has dimension 5, and S=1/2 has dimension 3.

The state |ψ> has three terms, which matches the dimension of the S=1/2 representation. So perhaps |ψ> is in the S=1/2 representation.

If that's the case, then S_total² |ψ> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ² |ψ> = (3/4)ℏ² |ψ>.

But according to our earlier calculation, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 7/4 ℏ², which would be incompatible with S=1/2,
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3) times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what its energy is. If not, what is the expectation value of E.

First, I need to recall some basics about spin systems and Hamiltonians. Spin operators S1, S2, S3 act on their respective particles. The dot product of two spin operators, S1·S2, can be expressed using the identity:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)

Where S_total is the total spin operator for the two particles, i.e., S1 + S2. This identity comes from the fact that the square of the total spin operator is S_total^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. So rearranging, we can solve for S1·S2.

In this problem, H is a sum of three such terms: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So H can be written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Maybe I can factor this expression or find a common structure that makes it easier to compute H acting on psi.

Also, since the state psi is symmetric in the up and down configurations, I should consider the symmetries of the state. Let me write down the state again:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩ + |↑⟩ |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ |↑⟩ ]

Wait, hold on. The first term is up1 up2 down3, the second is up1 down2 up3, and the third is down1 up2 up3. So each term has two spins up and one spin down, with the down spin being on the third particle in the first term, the second particle in the second term, and the first particle in the third term.

So psi is a superposition of three states where each has two up spins and one down spin, with the down spin moving among the three particles.

I wonder if this state has a particular symmetry or is an eigenstate of some operator. Maybe the total spin or something else.

But the main question is about the Hamiltonian H. So maybe I need to compute H psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

But calculating H psi directly might be complicated because H is a sum of terms like S1·S2, which involve dot products. Alternatively, I can use the identity I mentioned earlier to express each S_i·S_j term in terms of S_total^2.

But wait, H is a sum over all pairs, so perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared or something else.

Wait, for three spins, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be related to the total spin squared. Let me recall the formula.

In general, for three spins, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be written as [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2. Let me verify that.

Yes, because (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So if I subtract (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) and divide by 2, I get the sum of the dot products.

Therefore, H can be written as A*( [ (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2 ), where S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

But since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2. So S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

Now, (S_total)^2 = S1 + S2 + S3 squared. Let me denote S_total^2 = S(S+1) ħ^2, where S is the total spin quantum number.

So H = A*( [ S(S+1) ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ] / 2 )

Simplify: H = A*( (S(S+1) - 9/4 ) ħ^2 / 2 )

So H = A*( (S(S+1) - 9/4 ) / 2 ) * ħ^2

Therefore, H is proportional to S(S+1) - 9/4.

So for the state psi, if I can compute the total spin S of psi, then I can find the eigenvalue of H.

Therefore, I need to determine the total spin of the state psi. Let's see.

The state psi has two spins up and one spin down. Let me think about the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The multiplet structure is either a triplet (S=1/2) or a singlet (S=1/2 as well? Wait, no. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 (which decomposes into four states) and 1/2 (which decomposes into three states). So the state psi is a symmetric combination with two up and one down, so it's in the S=1/2 subspace.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin, so if I think about the state being symmetric under permutation of spins, then it can be in a spin-1/2 multiplet.

Alternatively, we can compute the total spin squared operator on psi and see what value it gives.

Because the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is S(S+1) ħ^2.

So, let me compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

But S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, so S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But we already have that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [ S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2 )

So perhaps, instead of computing H psi, we can compute S_total^2 psi, which might be easier, since we can find eigenvalues.

But let me try to compute S_total^2 psi.

But computing (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 psi means:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 psi = S1^2 psi + S2^2 psi + S3^2 psi + 2 S1·S2 psi + 2 S1·S3 psi + 2 S2·S3 psi.

But wait, H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so when we have 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), that's 2H.

But I think we can relate this to S_total^2. So maybe instead of computing each term, let's note that:

(S_total)^2 psi = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 psi

But since each S_i^2 is (3/4) ħ^2, as we saw earlier, then S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

So, (S_total)^2 psi = 9/4 ħ^2 psi + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi

But from H, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So:

(S_total)^2 psi = 9/4 ħ^2 psi + 2H psi

Therefore, if we can compute S_total^2 psi, we can find an expression involving H psi.

But perhaps it's better to compute S_total^2 psi.

Alternatively, we can think about the eigenvalue of S_total^2 on psi.

If psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, which it can be because it's a symmetric state with fixed number of up and down spins, then S_total^2 psi = S(S+1) ħ^2 psi.

Hence, if we can compute S_total^2 psi, we can find S.

So let me attempt to compute S_total^2 psi.

Note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

So, as above, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2H/A, since H = A*(sum S_i·S_j). So wait, that suggests that (S_total)^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2H/A.

Wait, that's a key relation.

So, if we can compute S_total^2 acting on psi, then we can find H psi.

But perhaps instead of that, let me try to compute S_total^2 psi.

But since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all rotations, so it can be diagonal in the coupled basis.

But the state psi is a specific state with two up spins and one down spin, which is a particular state in the S=1/2 multiplet.

Let me see if I can compute S_total^2 psi.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, we can think of S_total^2 as acting on each term in psi.

So, let's write psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Now, let's compute S_total^2 acting on each of these basis states.

First, note that |↑↑↓⟩ is a state where particles 1 and 2 are up, and particle 3 is down.

Similarly for the others.

The S_total^2 operator acts on each term as follows:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly for the others.

But since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, it will take basis states into states with the same total spin.

So, let's think about what (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ is.

First, let's compute S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩, and S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, the cross terms: compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩, and S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

Let me compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^12 - S1^2 - S2^2). So S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(S_total^12 - S1^2 - S2^2)|↑↑↓⟩

But S_total^12 is the total spin squared for particles 1 and 2, so acting on |↑↑↓⟩, S_total^12 |↑↑↓⟩ = S(S1S2)(S1+S2)(S1+S2 +1) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, no. Actually, S_total^12 |↑↑↓⟩ = [S1 + S2]^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S(S1S2)(S1+S2)(S1+S2 +1) ? Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much.

Wait, S_total^12 is the square of the total spin for particles 1 and 2, so acting on |↑↑↓⟩, it gives S(S1S2)(S1 + S2)(S1 + S2 + 1) ħ^2. But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the state |↑↑⟩ is part of the triplet (S=1) and the singlet (S=0). So, let's see.

The operator S_total^12 = (S1 + S2)^2. So S_total^12 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩:

= S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩

= (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 (S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩

= (3/2 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 (S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 (S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩

But what's the eigenvalue of (S1 + S2)^2 in the |↑↑⟩ state?

The |↑↑⟩ state is part of the triplet S=1, so (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ^2 |↑↑⟩, because S_total = S1 + S2 = 1, so S_total^2 = 1(1+1) ħ^2 = 2 ħ^2.

Therefore, (S1 + S2)^2 |↑↑⟩ = 2 ħ^2 |↑↑⟩.

But wait, in our case, it's |↑↑↓⟩, not |↑↑⟩⟨↑↑|.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe I should instead compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ directly.

Alternatively, let's consider that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^12 - S1^2 - S2^2). So S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(S_total^12 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(S_total^12 - 3/2 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩.

But S_total^12 |↑↑↓⟩ = [S1 + S2]^2 |↑↑↓⟩. Since particles 1 and 2 are both up, and particle 3 is down, S1 and S2 are each (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

But we can also think about S_total^12 acting on |↑↑↓⟩. The action of [S1 + S2]^2 on |↑↑↓⟩ would be:

= S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩

= (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ + (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩

= 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [ (S_total^12) - 3/2 ħ^2 ] / 2 |↑↑↓⟩

But we can also note that the operator S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ can be written in terms of spin-flips.

Wait, S1·S2 is for spin-1/2 particles, so it can be written as (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |↑↑↓⟩

Compute each term:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓⟩, similarly S2^x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓⟩.

So S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (iħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Wait, S^y |↑⟩ = -i |↓⟩, so S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩ = (-1) (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4) [ |↓↓↓⟩ - |↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩ ]

Wait, hold on, adding the contributions:

S1^x S2^x gives (ħ^2/4) |↓↓↓⟩

S1^y S2^y gives (-i^2)(ħ^2/4) |↓↓↓⟩ = (+1)(ħ^2/4) |↓↓↓⟩ since i^2 = -1

S1^z S2^z gives (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

So adding them up:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩

= (ħ^2/2) |↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

So S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/2) |↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

Hmm, so that's S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, we can compute S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ and S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

But this seems tedious, but let's try.

First, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩. Let's apply S1·S3 to |↑↑↓⟩.

Again, S1·S3 = S1^x S3^x + S1^y S3^y + S1^z S3^z.

Compute each term:

S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↓↑↓⟩

S3^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↑⟩

So S1^x S3^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↓↑↑⟩

Similarly, S1^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-iħ/2) |↓↑↓⟩

S3^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-iħ/2) |↑↑↑⟩

So S1^y S3^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ^2/4) |↓↑↑⟩

S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩

S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩

So S1^z S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

Putting it all together:

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4) |↓↑↑⟩ - (ħ^2/4) |↓↑↑⟩ + (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

Simplify:

The first and second terms cancel each other, leaving (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, compute S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

S2·S3 = S2^x S3^x + S2^y S3^y + S2^z S3^z.

Compute each term:

S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↓↓⟩

S3^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↑⟩

So S2^x S3^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↑↓↑⟩

Similarly, S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-iħ/2) |↑↓↓⟩

S3^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-iħ/2) |↑↑↑⟩

So S2^y S3^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1)(ħ^2/4) |↑↓↑⟩

S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩

S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩

So S2^z S3^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4) |↑↓↑⟩ - (ħ^2/4) |↑↓↑⟩ + (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩

Again, the first and second terms cancel, leaving (ħ^2/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, summarizing:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩

S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩

So, now, putting it back into (S_total)^2 |↑↑↓⟩:

(S_total)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩

Which is:

(3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2*( [ (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ ] + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ ) |↑↑↓⟩

Wait, that seems messy. Let me compute each term step by step.

First, S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly for S2^2 and S3^2, each gives (3/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩.

So S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩

Next, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩. From above:

2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2/4 |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2/4 |↑↑↓⟩ )

Simplify inside:

= 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ )

= 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (3 ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ )

= 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (3 ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ )

= (ħ^2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (3 ħ^2/2)|↑↑↓⟩

Therefore, combining everything:

(S_total)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + (ħ^2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (3 ħ^2/2)|↑↑↓⟩

So, 9/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Convert 9/4 and 3/2 to a common denominator:

9/4 = 18/8, 3/2 = 12/8, so together 18/8 + 12/8 = 30/8 = 15/4.

Therefore, (S_total)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (15/4 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Wait, but this seems strange. Because S_total^2 should be a scalar multiple of the state, right? Because S_total^2 is a Casimir operator. But here, it's giving two terms: one proportional to |↑↑↓⟩ and another to |↓↓↓⟩. But this suggests that |↑↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, which seems odd.

But wait, |↑↑↓⟩ is part of the symmetric subspace, which is the S=1/2 subspace, right? So it should be an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Therefore, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I compute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩, it's (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|↑↑↓⟩

I found that S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S1·S3 and S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ each gave (ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|↑↑↓⟩ = 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ )

= 2*( (ħ^2/2)|↓↓↓⟩ + (3 ħ^2/4)|↑↑↓⟩ )

= ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩ + 3 ħ^2 / 2 |↑↑↓⟩

Then, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, total:

S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = 9/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩ + 3/2 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩

= (9/4 + 3/2) ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Convert 3/2 to 6/4, so 9/4 + 6/4 = 15/4.

So, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (15/4 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩

Hmm. That's still giving two terms. So unless my computation is wrong, maybe the state |↑↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate, but how come?

Wait, actually, in three spin-1/2 particles, the subspace with two up and one down is not necessarily an eigenstate of S_total^2. It is part of the S=1/2 multiplet, but the multiplet includes other states as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the action of S_total^2 on |↑↑↓⟩ is not diagonal because it mixes with |↓↓↓⟩.

But that contradicts the idea that the spin states with two up and one down should form a multiplet.

Wait, maybe the S=1/2 multiplet for three spins has four states, not three. Wait, no.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

The S=3/2 multiplet has dimension 4, and the S=1/2 multiplet has dimension 3.

Wait, but in our case, the state psi has two up and one down, which is symmetric under permutation of spins. So, it should be in the S=1/2 symmetric subspace.

But the S=1/2 multiplet for three spins is symmetric, with three states: two with two up and one down, and one with two down and one up? No, actually, no, for three spins, symmetric states under permutation would have specific spin configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the basis.

But perhaps the key point is that if the state psi is in the S=1/2 subspace, then S_total^2 acting on psi should give a scalar multiple of psi.

But here, when I compute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩, it seems to give a combination of |↑↑↓⟩ and |↓↓↓⟩. So unless |↑↑↓⟩ is not an eigenstate, which seems strange.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe instead of computing S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩, I can write down all the possible states in the S=1/2 subspace and see how S_total^2 acts on them.

But that might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the state psi is symmetric in the three particles. So, perhaps the action of S_total^2 on psi can be found by considering the action on each term.

So, let's think about each term in psi:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

If I apply S_total^2 to each basis state, then the total state will be some combination of the basis states.

But since S_total^2 is the Casimir operator, it should act diagonally in the multiplet.

But perhaps I should note that psi is actually an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in psi, which would be ⟨psi|S_total^2|psi⟩.

But since H is proportional to S_total^2 minus a constant, perhaps this expectation value can be used.

Wait, but the question is whether psi is an eigenstate of H, which is A*(sum S_i·S_j).

So perhaps instead of trying to compute S_total^2 psi, I can compute H psi.

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We can write H = A*(sum S_i·S_j)

From earlier, we saw that sum S_i·S_j = [ S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

So, H = A*( [ S_total^2 - (9/4 ħ^2) ] / 2 )

= (A/2) [ S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ]

Therefore, H psi = (A/2) ( S_total^2 psi - (9/4) ħ^2 psi )

Therefore, if we can compute S_total^2 psi, we can get H psi.

But earlier, when I tried to compute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩, I got (15/4 ħ^2)|↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩, which seems problematic because it's mixing states.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that the state psi is symmetric under permutation of the spins. So, perhaps I can think about the action of S_total^2 on psi in terms of its symmetry.

But another approach: Maybe we can use the fact that the state psi is an eigenstate of the permutation operator, so it's in the symmetric subspace.

But perhaps I can compute the action of H on psi by using the fact that H = (A/2)( S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 )

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A / 8) ħ^2

So, if I can compute S_total^2 psi, then I can write H psi.

But from earlier, I tried to compute S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ and got 15/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ + ħ^2 |↓↓↓⟩, which seems strange because it's not a multiple of |↑↑↓⟩.

But perhaps this is correct because the total spin operator can take a basis state to another basis state.

But then, psi is a combination of three such basis states. So, perhaps when S_total^2 acts on psi, it will mix the different basis states, but since psi is in the S=1/2 multiplet, maybe it's an eigenstate.

Wait, let's write down the action of H on psi.

H psi = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi

Each term S_i·S_j acts on each term in psi.

So, let me compute S1·S2 acting on each term in psi.

First, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ^2/2)|
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S1, S2, S3 are the spin operators for each particle. The state ψ is given as 1/√3 times (↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H and find its energy if it is, or calculate the expectation value of E if it isn't.

First, let me recall some properties of spin operators. For spin 1/2 particles, each S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z, and the total spin S_i^2 = (S_i^x)^2 + (S_i^y)^2 + (S_i^z)^2. The eigenvalues for S_i^2 are ħ² * s(s+1) where s is the spin quantum number, which is 1/2 for each particle here.

The state ψ is a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. It's symmetric under permutation of the particles, I think. Let me check: the three terms are cyclic permutations where each term has two up spins and one down spin. So yes, it's symmetric.

I remember that for spin systems, the total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3 is important, but here the Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise dot products. Maybe I can express this in terms of the total spin.

I recall that S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2. Similarly for the other terms. So if I sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, it would be equal to [ (S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ] / 2.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate this to the square of the total spin S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Let me compute S_total^2:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) can be rewritten as:

H = A * [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2 ]

But since each S_i^2 is the same for each particle, and they have spin 1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ² for each. So,

H = A * [ (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) / 2 ] = (A/2) * (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ² )

Now, S_total is the sum of three spin 1/2 particles, so the possible total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Because when adding three 1/2 spins, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Because each pair can combine to 1 or 0, so adding three together can result in 1/2 or 3/2.

What is the state ψ? Let me see. It is a symmetric combination of states with two up and one down spin. Let me think about the total spin of this state.

Each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So the total spin projection is 1/2. But is this an eigenstate of S_total^2?

Wait, but ψ might not be an eigenstate of S_total^2 because it's not necessarily symmetric under all permutations. Wait, but in this case, it is symmetric under cyclic permutations, but not necessarily all permutations. Or is it? Let me think.

Wait, the state is a symmetric combination of three terms where each term has one particle in the down state and the other two up. So, it is symmetric under exchange of particles because any permutation of the particles would lead to another term in the sum. So the state is symmetric.

Therefore, the state ψ is in the symmetric subspace. The symmetric subspace for three particles is the subspace where the total spin is 3/2 or 1/2. But wait, does the symmetric subspace include all possible total spins? Or is it specific?

Let me think. For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2, and each of these is a two-dimensional representation (except for spin 1/2 which is one-dimensional). The symmetric subspace corresponds to the spin 3/2 state and the symmetric combination of the spin 1/2 triplet.

Wait, actually, no. For three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is the subspace that is symmetric under permutation of the three particles. The dimension of this subspace is 10, I believe, because the total Hilbert space is 2^3 = 8 dimensions, and the symmetric subspace is 10? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, no. For three particles, the symmetric subspace is the set of states that remain unchanged under permutation of any two particles. The dimension can be calculated using group theory. The symmetric group S3 acts on the Hilbert space, and the symmetric subspace is the traceless part or something? Wait, maybe it's better to recall that the symmetric subspace for spin states is the set of states that can be reached by symmetric operations, such as swapping particles.

But perhaps instead of getting bogged down in group theory, I can think in terms of the possible total spins.

Each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down, so it's a state with S_z = 1/2. Let me compute the total spin S_total^2 for ψ.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think about the eigenvalues. Since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, which is an operator that ψ might be an eigenstate of.

If I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 on ψ, then I can plug it into H to find the energy.

So, let me try to compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

But S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Since H is proportional to S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, which is (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can relate it to ⟨H⟩.

But maybe another approach is to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 on ψ.

Wait, another thought: for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state ψ is symmetric, so it's either part of the 3/2 multiplet or the 1/2 multiplet.

If I can figure out whether ψ is in the 3/2 spin state or the 1/2 spin state, then I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2.

But ψ has S_z = 1/2, so it must be part of the 3/2 multiplet or the 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, the 3/2 multiplet has S = 3/2 and thus S_z can be 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

The 1/2 multiplet has S = 1/2, so S_z can be 1/2, -1/2.

So, ψ has S_z = 1/2. So it could be in either the 3/2 or the 1/2 multiplet.

But I need to determine which one.

Let me see if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, let me think about the structure of the 3/2 and 1/2 multiplets.

The 3/2 multiplet is symmetric under permutation, while the 1/2 multiplet is also symmetric. Wait, no, the 1/2 multiplet isn't symmetric? Or is it?

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is 10-dimensional, but the total spin multiplets are the 3/2 (which is 4-dimensional, since 2*(2*1 +1) = 6, but wait, that's for two particles. For three particles, the 3/2 multiplet has dimension 4 and the 1/2 multiplet has dimension 3, I think. Wait, no, the dimension of the multiplet is 2S + 1, so for S=3/2, dimension 4, and for S=1/2, dimension 2? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin is S=1 or S=0. For S=1, dimension 2; for S=0, dimension 1.

For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin is S=3/2 and S=1/2. The 3/2 multiplet has dimension 4 (since 2S +1 =4), and the 1/2 multiplet has dimension 2 (since 2S +1=2). But wait, in total, we have 8 dimensions, so 4 + 2 =6, which is less than 8. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, actually, in the case of three spin 1/2 particles, the spin states decompose into multiplets as follows: one singlet (S=0, dimension 1) and other triplets. Wait, I think I might need to recall the exact decomposition.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is 10-dimensional, while the antisymmetric subspace is 2-dimensional. But I think that's in the context of all possible states. But since we are dealing with spin states, perhaps we can think in terms of total spin.

Alternatively, maybe I should just compute the eigenvalue.

Let me think: for the state ψ, which is symmetric, and has S_z=1/2, can I figure out whether it's part of the 3/2 multiplet or the 1/2 multiplet.

In the 3/2 multiplet, the states include all those with S_z= 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

In the 1/2 multiplet, the states include those with S_z=1/2, -1/2.

So ψ has S_z=1/2, so it can be in either the 3/2 or the 1/2 multiplet.

How can I distinguish between them?

Perhaps by looking at the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

If ψ is in the 3/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 ψ = ( (3/2)(3/2 +1) ) ħ² ψ = (15/4) ħ² ψ.

If ψ is in the 1/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 ψ = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² ψ = (3/4) ħ² ψ.

So if I can compute S_total^2 ψ, I can see which one it is.

But to do that, I need to know what S_total^2 is in the basis of the spin states. But since ψ is a combination of specific states, perhaps I can compute it explicitly.

Let me write out ψ in terms of computational basis states.

The computational basis states are |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>, |↑↓↓>, etc. But ψ is only a combination of the first three: |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>.

So ψ = (1/√3)( |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> )

I need to compute S_total^2 acting on each basis state and then on ψ.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩, which would give me the expectation value of S_total^2, and from there, compute the expectation value of H.

But since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, maybe I can compute ⟨H⟩ directly.

Wait, let me compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

But first, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

But since all S_i^2 are the same, and each acts on a different particle, their expectation values are the same.

So,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3⟨S1^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

But I also know that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩ )

Therefore, if I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 is known in terms of H, we can write:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ² )

So,

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(⟨S_total^2⟩ - (9/4)ħ² )

Therefore, if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, let me compute ⟨S_total^2⟩.

I know ⟨S1^2⟩ = (3/4)ħ² for each particle.

So,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

But we also have:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S3⟩ + 2⟨S2·S3⟩

Wait, but actually, in the expression for S_total^2, it's S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, when we take the expectation, it's ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

So, going back,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

But ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩ is equal to (⟨S_total^2⟩ - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) / 2

Wait, that seems circular.

Alternatively, let's denote X = ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

Then, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2X

But also, H = A X, so X = (H / A)

Plugging back,

⟨S_total^2⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(H / A )

Thus, rearranged:

H = (A/2)(⟨S_total^2⟩ - (9/4)ħ² )

Which is consistent.

But I think we need a different approach.

Let me try to compute X = ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩

I can compute each term separately.

Since S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z

Therefore, X = (1/2)(⟨S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ + S1^+ S3^- + S1^- S3^+ + S2^+ S3^- + S2^- S3^+⟩ ) + ⟨S1^z S2^z + S1^z S3^z + S2^z S3^z⟩

So, let's compute each part.

First, let's compute ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩.

Since the state ψ has two spins up and one spin down, the expectation value ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ will be non-zero only when both S1 and S2 are up or both are down. But in ψ, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, in each term of ψ, exactly two spins are up, so S1 and S2 can be both up, or one up and one down.

Wait, no. Let me think. The state ψ is symmetric, so each term is a different permutation where one spin is down and the others are up.

So, for example, in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are up, particle 3 is down.

So, in this term, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² = (1/4)ħ²

Similarly, ⟨S1^z S3^z⟩ = ⟨↑ | S1^z | ↑⟩ ⟨↓ | S3^z | ↓⟩ + ⟨↑ | S1^z | ↓⟩ ⟨↓ | S3^z | ↑⟩ + ... but wait, in this term, S3 is down, so ⟨S1^z S3^z⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ²

Wait, actually, since in each term, particles 1 and 2 are up, and particle 3 is down, so for that term:

⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² = 1/4 ħ²

⟨S1^z S3^z⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

⟨S2^z S3^z⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

So for the first term in ψ, the sum ⟨S1^z S2^z + S1^z S3^z + S2^z S3^z⟩ is 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4 ħ²

Similarly, for the second term in ψ, which is ↑1↓2↑3.

In this term, particles 1 and 3 are up, particle 2 is down.

So ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

⟨S1^z S3^z⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² = 1/4 ħ²

⟨S2^z S3^z⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

So sum is -1/4 +1/4 -1/4 = -1/4 ħ²

Similarly, the third term is ↓1↑2↑3

Here, particles 2 and 3 are up, particle 1 is down.

⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

⟨S1^z S3^z⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2)ħ² = -1/4 ħ²

⟨S2^z S3^z⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² = 1/4 ħ²

So sum is -1/4 -1/4 +1/4 = -1/4 ħ²

Therefore, for each term in ψ, the sum ⟨S1^z S2^z + S1^z S3^z + S2^z S3^z⟩ is -1/4 ħ²

Therefore, the total sum over ψ is 3*(-1/4) ħ² = -3/4 ħ²

So, the first part of X is -3/4 ħ².

Now, let's compute the second part of X, which is (1/2)(⟨S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ + S1^+ S3^- + S1^- S3^+ + S2^+ S3^- + S2^- S3^+⟩ )

This part is a bit more complicated because it involves the raising and lowering operators.

Let me recall that S^+ | ↓ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩, and S^- | ↑ ⟩ = | ↓ ⟩, and S^+ | ↑ ⟩ = 0, S^- | ↓ ⟩ =0.

So, for each pair S_i^+ S_j^-, we need to see how they act on the state ψ.

But ψ is a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down.

Let me try to compute each term in the second part of X.

First, ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩.

This operator acts as follows: S1^+ S2^- | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = S1^+ | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ = 0, because S1^+ | ↑ ⟩ =0.

Similarly, S1^+ S2^- | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ = S1^+ | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ = 0

Wait, let's be more careful.

Wait, the state ψ is a sum of three states, each with two up and one down spin. So, when S1^+ S2^- acts on each term, we need to see if any terms survive.

But S1^+ S2^- is the product operator, so it will flip spin 1 down and spin 2 up.

But in the state ψ, for each term, at most one spin is down, and it's in a specific position.

Let me take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩.

Applying S1^+ S2^- to |↑↑↓⟩:

S1^+ |↑⟩ =0, so S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓⟩ = 0

Similarly, in the second term |↑↓↑⟩:

S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑⟩: S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0, so again 0.

Third term |↓↑↑⟩:

S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑⟩: S1^+ |↓⟩ |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩ * (coefficient?)

Wait, S1^+ S2^- |↓⟩ |↑⟩ |↑⟩ = S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩, because S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, S1^+ is the raising operator for spin 1, S2^- is the lowering operator for spin 2.

So, acting on | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩:

S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩, S2^- | ↑ ⟩ = | ↓ ⟩.

Wait, no, S1^+ S2^- would be S1^+ acting on the first spin, S2^- acting on the second spin.

So, S1^+ S2^- | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩.

Similarly, the coefficient is 1 because S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩, and S2^- | ↑ ⟩ = | ↓ ⟩, but actually, S2^- | ↑ ⟩ = | ↓ ⟩, so the result is | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩? Wait, no.

Wait, S1^+ S2^- acts on the first and second spins. So, it acts on the first spin by raising it, and the second spin by lowering it.

So, S1^+ S2^- | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = S1^+ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ↑ ↑ ⟩

But wait, no, because S2^- is acting on the second spin, which is | ↑ ⟩, so it becomes | ↓ ⟩, but S1^+ is acting on the first spin.

Wait, no, the operator S1^+ S2^- acts on the first and second spins:

So, it's (S1^+ ⊗ I ⊗ I) (I ⊗ S2^- ⊗ I )

So, it raises spin 1 and lowers spin 2.

So, acting on | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩, we get (S1^+ | ↓ ⟩) ⊗ (S2^- | ↑ ⟩) ⊗ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩.

Wait, that's the result. So, S1^+ S2^- | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩.

Similarly, let's see what each term in ψ becomes when S1^+ S2^- is applied.

First term: | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩

S1^+ S2^- | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ = (S1^+ | ↑ ⟩) | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ = 0, because S1^+ | ↑ ⟩ =0.

Second term: | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩

S1^+ S2^- | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = (S1^+ | ↑ ⟩ ) | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = 0

Third term: | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩

Which we saw becomes | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩

So, S1^+ S2^- | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ = | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩

So, the result is | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩.

But in ψ, this is one of the terms. Specifically, ψ is 1/√3 ( | ↑ ↑ ↓ ⟩ + | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ + | ↓ ↑ ↑ ⟩ )

So, | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ is one of the terms.

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- ψ = | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ / √3

Similarly, ⟨ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ ⟩ is the coefficient of | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ in ψ, which is 1/√3. But with a complex conjugate, so 1/√3 * 1/√3 = 1/3.

Wait, but actually, the inner product ⟨ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ ⟩ is equal to the coefficient of | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ in ψ, which is 1/√3, but scaled by the normalization of ψ, so 1/√3 * 1/√3 = 1/3.

Wait, but S1^+ S2^- is an operator, so it's not just a scalar; we have to compute the expectation value.

Wait, to compute ⟨ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ ⟩, it's equal to the inner product of ψ and (S1^+ S2^- ψ).

But S1^+ S2^- ψ = | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ / √3

And ψ = ( | ↑ ↑ ↓ ⟩ + | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ + | ↓ ↑ ↑ ⟩ ) / √3

So, the inner product is (1/√3) * ⟨ ↑ ↑ ↓ | + ⟨ ↑ ↓ ↑ | + ⟨ ↓ ↑ ↑ | ) * ( | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ / √3 )

Only the ⟨ ↑ ↓ ↑ | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ term survives, which is 1.

So, the expectation value is (1/√3)(1/√3)(1) = 1/3.

Therefore, ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩ = 1/3 ħ (since the operator S1^+ S2^- has dimensions of ħ, the spin is in units of ħ, so S_i have eigenvalues in terms of ħ. But wait, the spin matrices have eigenvalues in terms of ħ/2, etc. Wait, maybe I need to be careful with units.

Wait, the spin operators S_i have eigenvalues in units of ħ/2. So, for spin 1/2, the eigenvalues of S_i^z are ± ħ/2.

But when we compute S1^+ S2^-, this operator has eigenvalues in terms of ħ. Because S1^+ raises spin 1 by 1 unit, and S2^- lowers spin 2 by 1 unit. So, the product S1^+ S2^- can create a transition from | ↓ ⟩ | ↑ ⟩ to | ↑ ⟩ | ↓ ⟩, which is a spin-flip. So, the expectation value should be in terms of ħ.

Wait, in our case, acting with S1^+ S2^- on the state ψ, which is symmetric, gives 1/√3 | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩.

So, the inner product ⟨ψ | S1^+ S2^- | ψ ⟩ = (1/√3) * (1/√3) = 1/3.

But since the operator S1^+ S2^- has units of ħ, the expectation value ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩ is (1/3) ħ.

Similarly, the same goes for ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩.

Because of symmetry, each term like ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩, ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩, etc., will have the same expectation value.

So, for each pair (i,j), ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ and ⟨S_i^- S_j^+⟩ will have the same expectation value.

Now, how many such terms are there?

In the term (1/2)(⟨S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ + ... ) we have six terms:

⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩, ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩, ⟨S1^+ S3^-⟩, ⟨S1^- S3^+⟩, ⟨S2^+ S3^-⟩, ⟨S2^- S3^+⟩

Each of these six terms has the same expectation value, which is 1/3 ħ.

Therefore, each ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ = 1/3 ħ

So, the sum (1/2)(6*(1/3)ħ) = (1/2)(2 ħ) = ħ

So, the second part of X is ħ.

Therefore, total X = -3/4 ħ² + ħ

Wait, no. Remember, X = (1/2)(sum of ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ terms ) + sum of ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ terms

Which is (1/2)(6*(1/3)ħ) + (-3/4)ħ²

So, (1/2)(6*(1/3)ħ) = (1/2)(2 ħ) = ħ

And sum of ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ is -3/4 ħ²

Thus, X = ħ - (3/4)ħ²

Wait, but wait, units are getting mixed here. Because S_i^z S_j^z is in terms of (ħ/2)^2, but X is supposed to be in units of (ħ)^2?

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no, each S_i^z is in units of ħ/2, so S_i^z S_j^z is in units of (ħ/2)^2, which is ħ² /4.

Similarly, S_i^+ S_j^- is in terms of ħ, since S_i^+ raises spin by 1, which is ħ, and S_j^- lowers spin by 1, which is -ħ.

So, the product has units of ħ^2.

Wait, no. Wait, operator S_i^+ has units of ħ, and S_j^- also has units of ħ, so their product has units of ħ^2.

But the expectation value ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ would have units of ħ^2.

But earlier, when we computed ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩, we saw that the inner product gave 1/3, which would be in units of ħ^2.

Wait, no, because the state ψ is a spin state, so when we compute ⟨ S_i^+ S_j^- ⟩, it's an expectation value of an operator with units of ħ^2.

But when we computed ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩, it gave 1/3, which must be in units of ħ^2.

Wait, but our final answer will have to be in terms of ħ², right? Because H is given in terms of A and ħ².

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should assign some scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think.

Wait, if all spin operators are in units of ħ, then S_i^z has eigenvalues +1/2, -1/2 in units of ħ. Therefore, S_i^z S_j^z has eigenvalues (1/2)(1/2) and similar, so (1/4)ħ².

Similarly, S_i^+ has eigenvalue +1 in units of ħ, and S_i^- has eigenvalue -1.

Therefore, S_i^+ S_j^- has eigenvalues +1*(-1) = -1 in units of ħ², but acting on a particular state.

Wait, no. Wait, S_i^+ S_j^- is a product of two operators, each of which has units of ħ.

Therefore, S_i^+ S_j^- has units of ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ is in units of ħ².

But when we computed ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩, we saw that acting on ψ gives | ↑ ↓ ↑ ⟩ / √3, so the inner product is 1/3, which is dimensionless, but we
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a given Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The system's state is given as ψ = (1/√3)*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H and, if so, what the energy would be. If not, I need to find the expectation value of the energy. The answer is supposed to be that it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue (2/3)*A*hbar², but I need to work through it step by step.

First, let me recall some properties of spin-½ particles and their operators. Each spin operator S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. For spin-½ particles, these satisfy the relation S_i^2 = (ħ²)(S(S+1)) where S = ½. So S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ² for each particle.

The given Hamiltonian is a sum of dot products of spin operators: H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). The dot product of two spin operators Si·Sj is equal to (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. Alternatively, another expression is Si·Sj = (1/2)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ). That might be a useful identity here.

So, maybe I can express H in terms of the total spin squared operator. Let me define S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, H can be rewritten as:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ) = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - 3*(S1^2)).

Wait, since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ² each, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

So, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²).

Therefore, H = (A/2)*S_total^2 - (A/2)*(9/4)ħ².

But perhaps more importantly, H is related to the total spin. So, for eigenstates of S_total^2, which have eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ², H would act on those states in a particular way.

In our problem, we have the state ψ. I need to figure out whether this state is an eigenstate of S_total^2. If it is, then it would also be an eigenstate of H, since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2.

Alternatively, I can compute the action of H on ψ directly, but that might be more complicated. Let's see what ψ looks like.

ψ = 1/√3*(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑).

So, all possible states where two spins are up and one is down, each with a coefficient of 1/√3.

Wait, that's a symmetric state under permutation of the particles. So, is it symmetric? It seems so because all permutations are included. So, the state is symmetric with respect to exchange of particles.

That could be helpful because symmetric states often have particular total spin properties.

Alternatively, I can consider the possible total spins of this state. The state ψ has two spins up and one spin down. Let me think about the possible total spin S for such a state.

But first, let's think about how the total spin operator S_total = S1 + S2 + S3 acts on ψ.

If I can compute S_total^2 ψ, and see if it's proportional to ψ, then ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, and hence H.

Alternatively, I can compute H acting on ψ. Either approach could work, but perhaps computing S_total^2 ψ is more straightforward.

So, let me try that.

First, express S_total^2 in terms of individual spins:

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Which is the same as before. So, since we already have H in terms of S_total^2, if I can compute S_total^2 ψ, then I can figure out how H acts.

But maybe it's better to compute the expectation value of H in this state, even if it's not an eigenstate.

Wait, but the key question is whether ψ is an eigenstate of H.

Since H is a function of S_total^2, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H will act on ψ as a scalar multiple.

So, to test whether ψ is an eigenstate, I need to check if S_total^2 ψ is proportional to ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the state ψ is a singlet under cyclic permutations but has a particular symmetry.

Alternatively, I can think of the state as a combination of states with different total spin.

Wait, let's think about how to construct such a state. It's two spin-ups and one spin-down, right? So, the state is (↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑)/√3.

Hmm, so all permutations where two spins are up and one is down.

What is the total spin of such a state?

Wait, another approach: think about the possible total spin states.

In three spin-½ particles, the possible total spin S can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

The state ψ is symmetric under exchange, so it must be a symmetric state in the basis of total spin states.

Wait, but is ψ symmetric under exchange? Let's see: each term is a permutation of two ups and one down.

Yes, under exchange of particles, each term is cycled to another term, so the state is symmetric.

Thus, it's part of the symmetric subspace.

In the symmetric subspace, the possible total spin states are the triplet states for S=1/2 and the singlet state for S=3/2.

Wait, no, actually, for three spin-½ particles, the symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, let me recall: for three spins, the possible total spin states are:

- S=3/2: which is a symmetric state.

- S=1/2: which is symmetric as well, because the symmetric subspace includes these.

Wait, but S=1/2 is actually a triplet? Wait, no: for three particles, the symmetric states can have S=3/2 and S=1/2.

For two particles, symmetric spin states correspond to triplet (S=1) and singlet (S=0). For three particles, the symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the symmetric states can be built.

So, the totally symmetric subspace is four-dimensional (since the total dimension is 2^3 = 8, and the symmetric subspace under permutation has dimension 1 + 3 = 4). So, it's spanned by the singlet state (all spins up, but that's not quite the case for three spins. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused).

Wait, actually, for three spin-½ particles, the totally symmetric subspace is four-dimensional, consisting of states that are symmetric under permutation of particles.

But the singlet state (all spins paired, but with three particles, the singlet state is different). Wait, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

So, S_total^2 is the sum of the squares of each spin plus twice the sum of the dot products: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

So, S_total^2 ψ = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) ψ.

Since S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are each 3/4 ħ², so their sum is 9/4 ħ².

Thus, S_total^2 ψ = (9/4 ħ²) ψ + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ψ.

But H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H ψ = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ψ.

So, from the above, S_total^2 ψ = (9/4 ħ²) ψ + 2*( (H/A) ψ ).

Therefore, if we can compute S_total^2 ψ, we can solve for how H acts on ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute S_total^2 ψ in another way.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, expanding it gives:

S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, if I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in state ψ, then I can express it in terms of H and the expectation values of S1^2, etc.

But wait, maybe I can compute S_total^2 ψ directly.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the action of each S_i on the state ψ.

Since ψ is a combination of states where two spins are up and one is down, let me try to see how each S_i operator acts on ψ.

But this might get complicated because S_i has x, y, z components.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H, which is the average energy, without worrying about eigenstates.

But the problem specifically asks whether ψ is an eigenstate of H.

Alternatively, let's think about the eigenvalues of H.

Since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, which has eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ².

So, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's an eigenstate of H, with eigenvalue (A/2)*(S(S+1)ħ² - 9/4 ħ²).

If ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's not an eigenstate of H.

So, let's try to compute S_total^2 ψ.

Wait, another idea: the state ψ is a member of the symmetric subspace, which is spanned by states that are symmetric with respect to permutation of the particles. In the symmetric subspace, S_total^2 commutes with the permutation group, so perhaps S_total^2 acts on ψ in a particular way.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute S_total^2 ψ by expanding the action of each S_i on ψ.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to note that each term in ψ is a state with two spins up and one spin down. So, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on each term.

Wait, but S_total^2 is an operator that can change the spin configuration.

So, let's write ψ as a sum:

ψ = (1/√3)(a + b + c),

where a = ↑↑↓, b = ↑↓↑, c = ↓↑↑.

Compute S_total^2 ψ:

S_total^2 ψ = S_total^2 (a + b + c)/√3.

So, S_total^2 ψ = (1/√3)(S_total^2 a + S_total^2 b + S_total^2 c).

Let me compute S_total^2 a, S_total^2 b, S_total^2 c.

First, S_total^2 a, where a = ↑↑↓.

Compute S_total^2 a:

Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2,

So S_total^2 a = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 a.

But S_i^2 a = (3/4)ħ² a, because S_i^2 acting on any spin state just gives a multiple of the identity.

Similarly, S_i · S_j a = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_i^2 a + S_j^2 a) ?

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to compute S_total^2 a using the formula:

S_total^2 a = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) a.

Since each S_i^2 a = (3/4)ħ² a, so:

= (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) a

= (9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) a.

Therefore, S_total^2 a = (9/4 ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) a.

Similarly, S_total^2 b and S_total^2 c will have the same structure.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute each term individually, focusing on the cross terms.

Alternatively, maybe compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 a.

But (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 a = S1^2 a + S2^2 a + S3^2 a + 2*(S1·S2 a + S1·S3 a + S2·S3 a).

So, as above, each S_i^2 a = (3/4)ħ² a, so that's 3*(3/4)ħ² a = 9/4 ħ² a.

Then, the cross terms: 2*(S1·S2 a + S1·S3 a + S2·S3 a).

So, S_total^2 a = 9/4 ħ² a + 2*(S1·S2 a + S1·S3 a + S2·S3 a).

Therefore, to compute S_total^2 a, we need to compute S1·S2 a, S1·S3 a, S2·S3 a.

So, let's compute each S_i·S_j a.

First, S1·S2 a: this is (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z, acting on state a.

But since a is ↑↑↓, let's see how S1·S2 acts on a.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

Let me compute each term:

First, S1^+ S2^- a: S1^+ is the spin raise operator for particle 1, S2^- is the spin lower operator for particle 2.

So, S1^+ acting on ↑↑↓: it would raise spin 1 from ↑ to ↗, but since it's spin ½, it can't go higher, so S1^+ a = 0.

Similarly, S2^- acting on ↑↑↓: it lowers spin 2 from ↑ to ↓, so S2^- a = ↓↑↓.

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- a = 0.

Next, S1^- S2^+ a: S1^- acting on ↑↑↓ lowers spin 1 from ↑ to ↓, resulting in ↓↑↓.

S2^+ acting on ↓↑↓ raises spin 2 from ↓ to ↑, resulting in ↓↑↑.

So, S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- a ⊗ S2^+ a.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, S1^- S2^+ acting on a.

Let me clarify:

S1^- S2^+ a = (S1^- a) ⊗ (S2^+ a).

Wait, S1^- a is S1^- |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1^- |↑↑↓⟩: it lowers spin 1 from ↑ to ↓, so it becomes |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2^+ acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is raising spin 2 from ↑ to ↗, but spin can't go beyond ↑, so S2^+ |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- a ⊗ S2^+ a = |↓↑↓⟩ ⊗ |↑↑↑⟩.

Wait, but that's a product state, but here we're dealing with three particles. So, is this a correct way?

Wait, actually, perhaps I should think of S1^- S2^+ as acting on the combined state a.

Wait, S1^- is on particle 1, S2^+ is on particle 2. So S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- a ⊗ S2^+ a.

But S1^- a is |↓↑↓⟩ and S2^+ a is |↑↑↑⟩.

Wait, but that would give a state |↓↑↑↑⟩, which is not correct because a is three particles.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me step back.

The state a is |↑↑↓⟩, which is a product state with particles 1 and 2 up, and particle 3 down.

So, S1^- acts only on particle 1, S2^+ acts only on particle 2.

So, S1^- acting on a gives |↓↑↓⟩, because it lowers spin 1.

Similarly, S2^+ acting on a gives |↑↑↑⟩, because it raises spin 2.

But since a is a tensor product of particles 1, 2, 3, S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- a ⊗ S2^+ a = |↓↑↓⟩ ⊗ |↑↑↑⟩.

Wait, but that's a four-particle state, but we only have three particles. So, actually, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, actually, S1^- acts on particle 1, so |↑↑↓⟩ becomes |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2^+ acts on particle 2, |↑↑↓⟩ becomes |↑↓↑⟩.

Wait, if I have S1^- S2^+ acting on a, I need to see what it does.

Wait, more precisely, S1^- S2^+ is a product of operators, so it's equivalent to S1^- acting first and then S2^+.

But when you act S1^- on a, you get |↓↑↓⟩, and then acting S2^+ on that would be raising spin 2 of |↑↓↓⟩ to |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but S2^+ acting on |↑↓↓⟩: spin 2 is ↑, so S2^+ acting on it would raise it to ↗, but since it's spin ½, it can't go higher, so S2^+ |↑↓↓⟩ = 0.

Wait, no, wait: S2^+ acting on |↑↓↓⟩: spin 2 is ↓, so S2^+ acting on ↓ would give ↑. Therefore, S2^+ |↑↓↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

So, putting it together:

S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- (S2^+ a) = S1^- |↑↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, because S2^+ a = S2^+ |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, right?

Wait, no, if a is |↑↑↓⟩, then S2^+ a would raise spin 2 from ↓ to ↑, so it's |↑↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ a = S1^- |↑↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

But S1^- acting on |↑↑↑⟩ gives |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ a = |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, then S1·S2 a = (S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) a = 0 + |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, S1^+ S2^- a = 0, as we saw earlier, because S1^+ can't raise spin 1, which is already up, and S2^- acting on a gives |↑↑↓⟩, but then S1^+ acting on that would do nothing because S1 is already up.

Wait, no, S1^+ S2^- a is (S1^+ a) ⊗ (S2^- a). S1^+ a = 0, because S1 is up, can't be raised. S2^- a = S2^- |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↓⟩.

But since S1^+ a = 0, the entire term is 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ a = |↓↑↑⟩ as above.

So, S1·S2 a = (0 + |↓↑↑⟩) = |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, but S1·S2 a is an operator; it's not a state, unless it's acting on a state.

Wait, no, I think I messed up.

Wait, S1·S2 is an operator, so S1·S2 a is an operator acting on a state a, giving a vector.

Wait, no, S1·S2 is a scalar operator, so S1·S2 a is a scalar acting on a. So, S1·S2 a is equal to (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) a + S1^z S2^z a.

So, S1^z S2^z a is (↑↑↓) evaluated at S1^z S2^z.

So, S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (+1/2) |↑↑↓⟩, and S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (+1/2) |↑↑↓⟩. So, S1^z S2^z a = (1/2)(1/2) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Then, S1^+ S2^- a = 0 as before, and S1^- S2^+ a = |↓↑↑⟩ as before.

Therefore, S1·S2 a = (0 + |↓↑↑⟩) + (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, but |↓↑↑⟩ is orthogonal to a = |↑↑↓⟩, so S1·S2 a is (1/4) a plus a vector in a different direction.

But this is a bit confusing because S1·S2 is an operator, not a scalar.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the matrix element ⟨b | S1·S2 | a ⟩, where b is another state.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ⟨b | (S1·S2) | a ⟩.

But this might be a better approach because S1·S2 is a Hermitian operator, so it has matrix elements between states.

So, perhaps I need to express a, b, c in terms of a basis and compute the matrix elements.

Wait, but this could take a while, as there are 8 states for three spin-½ particles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of expectation values.

Wait, given that ψ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, what is the expectation value of S_i·S_j for i ≠ j?

Well, for any two particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j in a state where two are up and one is down.

Alternatively, let's think about the singlet and triplet states for two spin-½ particles.

But in this case, it's three particles, so it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, let's note that the sum over i < j S_i·S_j is related to S_total^2.

Indeed, as we saw before, sum_{i < j} S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - sum_i S_i^2)/2.

Given that, if I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in ψ, and knowing that sum_i S_i^2 is fixed, I can find the expectation value of H.

Wait, but let me see:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, the expectation value of H in ψ is A*(⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S1·S3|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S2·S3|ψ⟩).

But due to the symmetry of ψ, all these terms will have the same expectation value.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = 3*A*⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩.

So, if I can compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩.

First, write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩ = (1/2)⟨ψ|S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩.

Compute each term.

First term: ⟨ψ|S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+|ψ⟩.

Second term: ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩.

Let's compute the second term first because it's simpler.

⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩.

Each S_i^z |↑⟩ = (+1/2)|↑⟩, S_i^z |↓⟩ = (-1/2)|↓⟩.

So, S1^z S2^z acting on a product state |s1 s2 s3⟩ = (s1^z)(s2^z)|s1 s2 s3⟩.

Thus, ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩ = sum_{s1, s2, s3} 1/√3 * 1/√3 * (s1^z)(s2^z) * ⟨s1 s2 s3 | ψ ⟩.

But ψ is a combination of three terms: a = |↑↑↓⟩, b = |↑↓↑⟩, c = |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩ = (1/3) [⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|] S1^z S2^z [ |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ ].

Compute each term:

⟨a| S1^z S2^z |a⟩: in state a = |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

So, ⟨a| S1^z S2^z |a⟩ = 1/4.

Similarly, ⟨b| S1^z S2^z |b⟩: b = |↑↓↑⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

⟨c| S1^z S2^z |c⟩: c = |↓↑↑⟩, S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Thus, ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩ = (1/3)(1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12.

Now, the first term: (1/2)⟨ψ|S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+|ψ⟩.

Let me compute ⟨ψ|S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ|S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩.

First, ⟨ψ|S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩.

Note that S1^+ S2^- is the operator that acts on particle 1 and 2.

So, let's see: S1^+ S2^- |s1 s2 s3⟩ = S1^+ |s1⟩ ⊗ S2^- |s2⟩ ⊗ |s3⟩.

Compute this for each component of ψ.

So, ψ = 1/√3 (a + b + c), and we can compute ⟨ψ| (S1^+ S2^-) ψ.

Note that S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0, because it's spin ½. So, S1^+ acting on any state where s1 is ↑ will give 0.

Looking at ψ:

ψ = (a + b + c)/√3 = (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

So, S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ = S1^+ S2^- ψ.

But since S1^+ |↑↑↓⟩ = 0, and S1^+ |↑↓↑⟩ = 0, because S1 is ↑ in both, so S1^+ acting on either gives 0.

Only S1^+ |↓↑↑⟩ could give something, but S1^+ |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Wait, but in ψ, the third term is |↓↑↑⟩, so S1^+ S2^- acting on |↓↑↑⟩.

Compute S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑⟩ = S1^+ |↓⟩ ⊗ S2^- |↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩.

S1^+ |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, S2^- |↑⟩ = |↓⟩.

So, S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- ψ = (0 + 0 + |↑↓↑⟩)/√3 = |↑↓↑⟩ / √3.

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|) |↑↓↑⟩.

But |↑↓↑⟩ is the same as |b⟩.

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(⟨a|b⟩ + ⟨b|b⟩ + ⟨c|b⟩).

But ⟨a|b⟩, ⟨a|c⟩, etc., are zero because a, b, c are orthogonal.

Wait, a = |↑↑↓⟩, b = |↑↓↑⟩, c = |↓↑↑⟩. They are all different, so their inner products are zero.

So, ⟨ψ| S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(0 + 1 + 0) = 1/√3.

Similarly, compute ⟨ψ| S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩.

S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩ = S1^- S2^+ ψ.

Looking at ψ, which is (a + b + c)/√3.

Compute S1^- S2^+ |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^- |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^+ |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩.

S1^- |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, S2^+ |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ (since it's spin ½, can't go up). Wait, no: S2^+ |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ + |↓⟩, but actually, no, S2^+ is raising operator, so S2^+ |↑⟩ = 0.

Wait, no, S2^+ |↑⟩ is the spin-up state, which is already the highest, so S2^+ |↑⟩ = 0.

Wait, perhaps I messed up. Let me think:

S1^- S2^+ |s1 s2 s3⟩ = (S1^- |s1⟩) ⊗ (S2^+ |s2⟩) ⊗ |s3⟩.

So, for a = |↑↑↓⟩:

S1^- |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, S2^+ |↑⟩ = 0, so S1^- S2^+ a = |↓⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ |↓⟩ = 0.

Similarly, for b = |↑↓↑⟩:

S1^- |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, S2^+ |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so S1^- S2^+ b = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

For c = |↓↑↑⟩:

S1^- |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, S2^+ |↑⟩ = 0, so S1^- S2^+ c = |↑⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ |↑⟩ = 0.

Therefore, S1^- S2^+ ψ = (0 + |↓↑↑⟩ + 0)/√3 = |↓↑↑⟩ / √3.

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(⟨a| + ⟨b| + ⟨c|) |↓↑↑⟩.

|↓↑↑⟩ is c.

Thus, ⟨ψ| S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(⟨a|c⟩ + ⟨b|c⟩ + ⟨c|c⟩).

But ⟨a|c⟩ = ⟨b|c⟩ = 0, and ⟨c|c⟩ = 1.

Therefore, ⟨ψ| S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)(0 + 0 + 1) = 1/√3.

Therefore, putting it all together:

⟨ψ| (S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ| S1^+ S2^- |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ| S1^- S2^+ |ψ⟩ = (1/√3) + (1/√3) = 2/√3.

Therefore, the first term in ⟨S1·S2⟩ is (1/2)*(2/√3) = 1/√3.

Adding the second term which we found earlier, ⟨ψ|S1^z S2^z|ψ⟩ = -1/12.

Thus, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/√3) + (-1/12) = (4/12√3 - 1/12) = (4 - √3)/12? Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, wait: (1/√3) is approximately 0.577, and -1/12 is approximately -0.0833, so adding them gives about 0.494. But let me compute it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, no, actually
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if so, find its energy. If not, I should calculate the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall some basics about spin systems. Spin operators S1, S2, S3 act on their respective particles. The Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of these spin operators. Each term S_i·S_j is the scalar product, which can be expanded as (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But maybe for this problem, there's a smarter way to handle it without expanding everything.

The state psi is symmetric in a way: each term has two spins up and one spin down, and the down spin is on the third particle in each term. So, it's like all possible configurations where two particles are up and one is down, with the down particle cycling through the three positions. That symmetry might help in simplifying the calculations.

I remember that for multiple spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3. The square of the total spin is S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I rearrange this, I get S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Since each S_i^2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ² for spin-1/2 particles, each S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ².

So substituting, H = A*( (S^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( (S^2 - (9/4) ħ² ) / 2 ). Therefore, H = (A/2) S^2 - (9/8) A ħ². Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me recheck:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So H = A*( (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ).

Since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

Thus, H = A*( S^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ² ) / 2 = (A/2) S^2 - (9/8) A ħ².

But maybe instead of expressing H in terms of S^2, I should think about whether the state psi is an eigenstate of S^2, or if it's an eigenstate of H.

Alternatively, since H is a sum of pairwise spin interactions, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term in the state psi and then sum them up.

Let me first compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each pair (i,j) in the state psi. Let's denote E_ij = <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>.

So, H = A*(E12 + E13 + E23). Therefore, if I can compute E12, E13, E23, I can find the expectation value of H.

So, E_ij = <psi| S_i·S_j |psi> = <psi| (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z |psi>.

But perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I can express S_i·S_j in terms of the total spin S^2 and the individual spins.

Wait, but earlier I saw that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2, so H = A*(S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2.

But maybe I should think in terms of eigenvalues. Let me consider the total spin S^2 acting on the state psi. If I can determine the eigenvalue of S^2 for psi, then I can compute H.

But first, what is the possible total spin S for three spin-1/2 particles? For two particles, we have spin 1 and spin 0 (singlet and triplet). For three particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me think: for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are either S=3/2 or S=1/2. Let me confirm: when you combine three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. So, the state psi must be either part of the triplet (S=3/2) or the singlet (S=1/2) state.

But looking at psi, it's symmetric in a certain way. Let me compute the total spin of psi.

Wait, perhaps I can find the eigenvalue of S_z for the state psi. Since in each term of psi, exactly two spins are up and one spin is down. So the total Sz = 2*(1/2) - 1*(1/2) = (1 - 1/2) = 1/2. So the state psi has Sz = 1/2.

Wait, but is that an eigenvalue? If the state is an eigenstate of S_z, then it's an eigenstate of Sz, but that doesn't necessarily make it an eigenstate of S^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if psi is symmetric under spin permutations. Let me think: psi is a symmetric combination of all possible states with two up and one down. So, it's symmetric under permutations of the particles. Therefore, it's in the symmetric representation, likely corresponding to the triplet state with S=3/2.

Wait, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation would form the triplet states with S=3/2, and the antisymmetric would form the singlet with S=1/2. Hmm, but psi is symmetric, so perhaps it's part of the triplet.

Wait, but let me think again: for two particles, the triplet states are symmetric, and the singlet is antisymmetric. For three particles, the situation is more complicated. Let me try to see what the possible states are.

The triplet state with S=3/2 would consist of all symmetric states under permutation, whereas the singlet with S=1/2 would be antisymmetric. So, if psi is symmetric, it should be part of the triplet with S=3/2.

Therefore, perhaps the state psi is an eigenstate of S^2 with eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (15/4) ħ².

If that's the case, then H = A*(S^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 = A*((15/4 ħ²) - (9/4 ħ²))/2 = A*(6/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(3/2 ħ²)/2 = (3/4) A ħ². But the user says the eigenvalue is 2/3 A ħ², so I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again:

H = A*(S^2 - 3*(3/4 ħ²))/2.

If S^2 for the triplet state is (S(S+1))ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = (15/4) ħ².

So, S^2 = 15/4 ħ².

Then, H = A*((15/4 ħ²) - 3*(3/4) ħ² ) / 2.

Compute numerator inside the brackets: (15/4) - (9/4) = 6/4 = 3/2.

So, H = A*(3/2 ħ²) / 2 = A*(3/4) ħ².

Hmm, that's (3/4) A ħ², but the answer given is (2/3) A ħ². So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe my assumption that psi is part of the S=3/2 triplet is incorrect. Let me check the total spin again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S^2 for the state psi.

Compute <psi| S^2 |psi> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>.

Expanding S^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, <S^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ² each, so sum is 9/4 ħ².

Now, what is <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>?

That's (1/2)(<S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+> + ... ) + <S1^z S2^z + ... >. But maybe it's easier to compute each term.

Alternatively, since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), then the expectation value of H is A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

So, if I can compute each <S_i·S_j>, I can sum them and multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

Let me compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> + <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> ) + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

Similarly for the other terms.

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> can be computed using the identity:

<S_i·S_j> = (1/4)(<S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+> + <S_i^z S_j^z>).

But perhaps a smarter way is to consider the singlet and triplet states. For two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S=0 and <S1·S2> = -3/4 ħ², while the triplet states have S=1 and <S1·S2> = 1/2 ħ².

Wait, but in this problem, we have three particles, but I can perhaps consider each pair separately and use the two-spin states.

Wait, but the state psi is a three-particle state, so each pair's state is entangled with the third particle. Hmm, perhaps it's better to calculate each pairwise expectation value.

Let me try computing <S1·S2>.

Each term in psi is a product state of two ups and one down. Let's list all three terms:

Term 1: up1 up2 down3

Term 2: up1 down2 up3

Term 3: down1 up2 up3

Each term is a product state with two ups and one down. The state psi is (1/sqrt(3)) times the sum of these three terms.

Now, let's compute <S1·S2>:

We can write S1·S2 as (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> + <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi>) + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

First, let's compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

In each term of psi, S1^z and S2^z are both up in two terms and down in one.

Wait, for each basis state in psi:

Term 1: up1 up2 down3: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (+1/2)^2 = +1/4.

Term 2: up1 down2 up3: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Term 3: down1 up2 up3: S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Since each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(3), the expectation value is:

(1/3)[ (+1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12.

Wait, that can't be right because the expectation value of S1^z S2^z in a state with two ups and one down should average to something else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how I compute it.

Wait, each term in psi is a product state where two are up and one is down. Let me check each term:

In Term 1: up1 up2 down3. So S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = +1/4.

Term 2: up1 down2 up3. S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Term 3: down1 up2 up3. S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

So, the sum of S1^z S2^z over the three terms is +1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Then, the expectation value <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> is (1/3)(-1/4) = -1/12.

Wait, but I thought the state has two ups and one down, but perhaps the calculation is correct. Now, moving on to the other terms.

Compute <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi>:

This operator S1^+ S2^- flips the spin of S2 from down to up and S1 from up to down.

So, let's see what each term in psi becomes when we apply S1^+ S2^-.

Term 1: up1 up2 down3.

Applying S1^+ S2^- to this term: S1^+ up1 = 0 (since up is already up), S2^- down2 = 0. So the entire term becomes 0.

Term 2: up1 down2 up3.

S1^+ up1 = 0, S2^- down2 = up2. So the term becomes up1 up2 up3, multiplied by sqrt(3)/1, but wait, let me think carefully.

Wait, applying S1^+ to up1 gives zero, and S2^- to down2 gives up2. So the result is |up1 up2 up3>, which is a different state. But how does this contribute to the expectation value? Wait, the expectation value is <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi>.

So, let's compute the action of S1^+ S2^- on each term in psi and see if any of them project onto psi.

Term 1: up1 up2 down3.

After S1^+ S2^-: S1^+ up1 = 0, S2^- down2 = up2. So the result is 0.

Term 2: up1 down2 up3.

After S1^+ S2^-: S1^+ up1 = 0, S2^- down2 = up2. So the state becomes |up1 up2 up3>.

Term 3: down1 up2 up3.

After S1^+ S2^-: S1^+ down1 = up1, S2^- up2 = 0. So the result is |up1 down2 up3>.

So, when we apply S1^+ S2^- to psi, we get (1/sqrt(3)) [ 0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

Now, the inner product <psi| (S1^+ S2^- psi) is (1/sqrt(3)) [ <up1 up2 down3| + <up1 down2 up3| + <down1 up2 up3| ] acting on (1/sqrt(3)) [ 0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

So, let's compute each component:

<up1 up2 down3| S1^+ S2^- psi> = 0, because S1^+ S2^- psi has |up1 up2 up3> and |up1 down2 up3>, and <up1 up2 down3| acting on these would give zero since they don't have down3 in the same position.

Similarly, <up1 down2 up3| S1^+ S2^- psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + (1/sqrt(3)) <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3>.

But <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> = 0 because down2 vs up2. Similarly, <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3> = 1.

Similarly, <down1 up2 up3| S1^+ S2^- psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) <down1 up2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + (1/sqrt(3)) <down1 up2 up3| up1 down2 up3>.

Again, the first term is zero because down1 vs up1. The second term is zero because up2 vs down2.

So the total <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> is (1/3)(0 + 0 + 0) = 0. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I apply S1^+ S2^- to Term2, I get |up1 up2 up3>, which is orthogonal to psi. Similarly, applying to Term3 gives |up1 down2 up3>, which is also orthogonal to psi. So, the expectation value <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> is zero.

Wait, that can't be right because in some cases there could be non-zero contributions, but perhaps in this specific state, it's zero.

Similarly, let's compute <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi>.

S1^- S2^+ flips spin of S1 from down to up and S2 from up to down.

So, let's apply S1^- S2^+ to each term in psi:

Term1: up1 up2 down3.

S1^- up1 = 0, S2^+ up2 = 0. So Term1 becomes 0.

Term2: up1 down2 up3.

S1^- up1 = 0, S2^+ down2 = up2. So Term2 becomes |up1 up2 up3>.

Term3: down1 up2 up3.

S1^- down1 = up1, S2^+ up2 = 0. So Term3 becomes |up1 down2 up3>.

So, S1^- S2^+ psi is (1/sqrt(3))[ 0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

Now, <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> is (1/sqrt(3)) [ <up1 up2 down3| + <up1 down2 up3| + <down1 up2 up3| ] acting on (1/sqrt(3)) [ 0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

So, again, each component:

<up1 up2 down3| S1^- S2^+ psi> = 0, because we have |up1 up2 up3> and |up1 down2 up3>, and the overlap with up1 up2 down3 is zero.

<up1 down2 up3| S1^- S2^+ psi> = (1/sqrt(3))( <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3> )

Again, <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> = 0, and <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3> = 1, so this gives 1/sqrt(3) * 1/sqrt(3) * 1 = 1/3.

Similarly, <down1 up2 up3| S1^- S2^+ psi> = (1/sqrt(3))( <down1 up2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + <down1 up2 up3| up1 down2 up3> ) = 0 + 0 = 0.

So, total <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (1/3)(1/3 + 0 + 0) = 1/9. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when we compute <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi>, we have:

|psi> = (1/sqrt(3))(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3).

So S1^- S2^+ |psi> is (1/sqrt(3))[0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

Then, <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> is (1/sqrt(3))[ <up1 up2 down3| + <up1 down2 up3| + <down1 up2 up3| ] * (1/sqrt(3))[0 + |up1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

So, the inner product is:

(1/3) [ <up1 up2 down3| up1 up2 up3> + <up1 up2 down3| up1 down2 up3> + <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3> + <down1 up2 up3| up1 up2 up3> + <down1 up2 up3| up1 down2 up3> ].

But let's compute each term:

1. <up1 up2 down3| up1 up2 up3> = 0, because down3 vs up3.

2. <up1 up2 down3| up1 down2 up3> = 0, because down2 vs up2.

3. <up1 down2 up3| up1 up2 up3> = 0, because down2 vs up2.

4. <up1 down2 up3| up1 down2 up3> = 1.

5. <down1 up2 up3| up1 up2 up3> = 0, because down1 vs up1.

6. <down1 up2 up3| up1 down2 up3> = 0, because up2 vs down2.

So, the total expectation value is (1/3)(0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0) = 1/3.

Wait, that seems better. So, <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> = 1/3.

Similarly, earlier, <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> = 0.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(0 + 1/3) + (-1/12).

Wait, earlier, I computed <S1^z S2^z> as -1/12.

So, putting it all together:

<S1·S2> = (1/2)(0 + 1/3) + (-1/12) = (1/2)(1/3) - 1/12 = (1/6) - (1/12) = (2/12 - 1/12) = 1/12 ħ²? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, S_i·S_j is in units of ħ², right?

Wait, actually, S_i and S_j are spin operators, so S_i·S_j has units of ħ². So, when we compute expectation values, they should be in units of ħ².

Wait, but in my previous calculations, I was treating S_i^z as units of 1/2 ħ. So, when I compute S_i^z S_j^z, it's (1/2 ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ², and similarly for the other terms.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me correct that.

So, in the previous calculation, <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/12) ħ², because each S_i^z is in units of 1/2 ħ, so their product is (1/2 ħ)² = (1/4) ħ².

Wait, but in the calculation, I found <S1^z S2^z> = -1/12 in terms of (1/4) ħ². So, that would be <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/12) * (1/4) ħ²? No, I think I'm confusing myself.

Wait, let me take a step back.

Each S_i^z is an operator whose eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So, the product S1^z S2^z has eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2, (ħ/2)^2, (-ħ/2)^2, etc.

But when I computed the expectation value <S1^z S2^z>, I got -1/4 for each term in the sum, but that was in units of (1/2)^2, so the actual expectation value is (-1/4) * (ħ/2)^2 per term? Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, actually, S1^z S2^z is an operator whose eigenvalues are (s1^z)(s2^z) where s1^z and s2^z are ±1/2. So, when I compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>, I have to calculate it as the sum over the states in psi.

Each term in psi is a product state, so when you compute S1^z S2^z, it's just the product of the individual spins. So, for each term:

Term1: up1 up2 down3: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (+1/2)(+1/2) = +1/4.

Term2: up1 down2 up3: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (+1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Term3: down1 up2 up3: S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, so S1^z S2^z = (-1/2)(+1/2) = -1/4.

So, the sum over the three terms is 1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4 = -1/4.

Then, the expectation value is (1/3)(-1/4) = -1/12 in units of (1/4) ħ²? Wait, no, no, because S1^z is in units of ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z has units of (ħ^2)/4. So, <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/12) * (1/4) ħ²? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the expectation value in terms of ħ². So, each S_i^z S_j^z contributes (1/2)^2 ħ², which is (1/4) ħ². So, for each term, the average of S1^z S2^z is (1/4) for up-up, (-1/4) for up-down, and (-1/4) for down-up.

Wait, but in the three terms of psi, how many up-ups, up-downs, and down-ups are there?

In the three terms:

Term1: up-up-down. So S1^z S2^z = +1/4.

Term2: up-down-up. So S1^z S2^z = -1/4.

Term3: down-up-up. So S1^z S2^z = -1/4.

Thus, each of the three terms contributes +1/4, -1/4, -1/4. So, the average is (1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) = -1/4, multiplied by 1/3 (since each term is weighted by 1/sqrt(3)), so <S1^z S2^z> = (-1/4) * (1/3) = -1/12 in units of (1/4) ħ², which is - ħ²/12 * (1/4)? No, wait.

Wait, I think the confusion is in the units. Let me correct this.

Each S_i^z is (1/2)ħ, so S_i^z S_j^z = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) = (1/4) ħ². So, when I compute the expectation value, I should multiply the numerical value by (1/4) ħ².

So, from the three terms, the sum of S1^z S2^z is 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4, which in terms of (1/4) ħ² is (-1/4) * (1/4) ħ² = (-1/16) ħ². Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the S1^z S2^z operator already includes the (1/2)^2 factor, so each term is in (1/4) ħ².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute <S1^z S2^z> as (sum of individual terms) * (1/4) ħ².

So, the expectation value is (sum of S1^z S2^z over the terms) times (1/4) ħ² divided by 3, since the state is normalized.

Wait, so each term in psi contributes:

Term1: +1/4,

Term2: -1/4,

Term3: -1/4.

So, the sum is -1/4, and the expectation value is (-1/4) * (1/4) ħ² = (-1/16) ħ²? That seems too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead note that in two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (s(s+1) - 3/4) ħ², where s is the total spin.

But in this case, we have three particles, so each pair is part of a larger system. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 for the state psi.

But maybe a better approach is to note that for the state psi, each pair has a certain number of up-up, up-down, and down-up configurations. Wait, but in our state, each term has exactly two ups and one down, so for each pair, how often does it have both up, both down, or one up and one down.

Wait, for the three terms in psi:

Term1: up1 up2 down3 → S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 +1/4 = 1/2, but that's not correct because S·S is not just the product of spins; it's the sum of their products.

Wait, perhaps I'm better off using the identity that for any two spins, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

But since we have three spins, maybe considering the total spin is better.

Wait, let me think again. So, for each pair, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> in the state psi can be found.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of H and determine if psi is an eigenstate.

Wait, perhaps the key is that psi is symmetric under permutation of the particles, so it's part of the triplet state with total spin S=3/2, which would be an eigenstate of S^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1) ħ² = (3/2)(5/2) ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

If that's the case, then H = A*(S^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2.

So, substituting S^2 = 15/4 ħ²,

H = A*(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(6/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(3/2 ħ²)/2 = (3/4) A ħ².

But the answer given is 2/3 A ħ², which doesn't match. So, perhaps my assumption that psi is part of the S=3/2 triplet is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the state psi is part of the S=1/2 singlet, which would have S^2 = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Then, H = A*(3/4 ħ² - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2 = A*(-9/4 ħ²)/2 = (-
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and S_i are the spin operators for each particle. The state provided is psi = (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, I should recall what eigenfunctions and eigenvalues mean. An eigenfunction of an operator H is a function that only changes by a scalar factor when H is applied to it. In other words, H acting on the eigenfunction gives the eigenvalue multiplied by the function. So, if I can apply H to psi and see if I get a multiple of psi, then it's an eigenfunction, and that multiple is the eigenvalue.

The Hamiltonian H is a sum of pairwise spin interactions: S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. Each of these terms is a dot product of two spin operators. Since each S_i is a spin-1/2 operator, their dot product will involve the Pauli matrices for each particle.

I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared (S_total)^2. The relation is S_i·S_j = (S_total)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 all over 2. So, maybe that could be useful in simplifying H.

Let me write that down:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)

Wait, but actually, (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + 2 S_i·S_j + S_j^2, so solving for S_i·S_j gives:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2]

Yes, that's correct. Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ^2 - (3/4)ħ^2] = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2)ħ^2].

Therefore, each term in H can be written in terms of S_total squared.

But wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S_total squared is S1 + S2 + S3)^2, which expands to S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2.

But since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, this becomes [S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2]/2.

Thus, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2]/2 ) = A/2 (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2).

So, H is proportional to S_total^2. Therefore, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, it will also be an eigenstate of H.

Wait, what is the eigenvalue for S_total^2? For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can range from 3/2 to -3/2 in integer steps. However, three spin-1/2 particles can combine into various total spins. Let me recall how three spin-1/2 particles combine.

Each pair can combine to spin 0 or 1. For three particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be obtained by combining two particles first, then combining the result with the third.

First, combine particles 1 and 2: they can form a singlet (spin 0) or a triplet (spin 1). Then, combine that with particle 3.

If particles 1 and 2 form a singlet (spin 0), then combining with particle 3 (spin 1/2) can result in spin 1/2.

If particles 1 and 2 form a triplet (spin 1), then combining with particle 3 (spin 1/2) can result in spin 3/2 or spin 1/2.

Therefore, the possible total spins for three spin-1/2 particles are 3/2 and 1/2.

So, the total spin states can have S_total = 3/2 or S_total = 1/2. Thus, S_total^2 can have eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ^2, so for S=3/2, it is (3/2)(5/2)ħ^2 = (15/4)ħ^2, and for S=1/2, it is (1/2)(3/2)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, if psi is a state with total spin S, then S_total^2 |psi> = S(S+1)ħ^2 |psi>.

But what is the state psi in terms of total spin? Let's look at it.

psi is given as a symmetric combination of up-up-down, up-down-up, and down-up-up. So, in terms of spin configurations, each term has two spins up and one spin down.

Wait, that's an interesting point. Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, in terms of total spin, is this state symmetric under permutation of the particles? Let me see.

The state psi is symmetric because swapping particles 1 and 2, 1 and 3, or 2 and 3 would just permute the terms, but since the coefficients are all the same, it remains the same. So, psi is symmetric under particle exchange.

Therefore, if the state is symmetric, then perhaps it has total spin 1, because for symmetric states, spin 1 is symmetric, and spin 0 is antisymmetric. But wait, in our case, we have three particles, so when combining spins, the symmetry of the state depends on the total spin.

Wait, for two particles, spin 1 is symmetric and spin 0 is antisymmetric. For three particles, the symmetry of the state with respect to permutation is determined by the total spin. I think that if the total spin S is such that S = 1/2 or 3/2, then the states with that spin have certain symmetries.

Wait, maybe I need to recall that for symmetric states, the total spin S can only be 1/2 or 3/2? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think about it. For three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (total spin 0) is antisymmetric under particle exchange. The triplet states (total spin 1) are symmetric.

Wait, but for three particles, the spin states can be more complicated. Because for three particles, you can have symmetric and antisymmetric states for different total spins.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's better to compute the total spin squared operator on the state psi and see its eigenvalue. If I can compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>, then since H is proportional to S_total^2, I can find the expectation value of H.

Yes, that might be a feasible approach.

So, if I can compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>, that would give me the expectation value of H up to the constant.

Given that, let me compute this expectation value.

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, since S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is part of H, I can write H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

But maybe it's better to compute <psi|S_total^2|psi> directly.

Given that each S_i is a vector operator, S_total^2 can be computed as:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, <psi | S_total^2 | psi> = <psi|S1^2|psi> + <psi|S2^2|psi> + <psi|S3^2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S3|psi> + 2<psi|S2·S3|psi>

Now, let's compute each term.

First, each S_i^2 for spin 1/2 is (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, <psi| S1^2 |psi> = (3/4)ħ^2 <psi| psi> = (3/4)ħ^2 * 1, since psi is normalized.

Similarly, <psi| S2^2 |psi> = <psi| S3^2 |psi> = (3/4)ħ^2 each.

So, summing these up: 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

Now, the next terms are the cross terms: 2<psi| S1·S2 |psi>, 2<psi| S1·S3 |psi>, and 2<psi| S2·S3 |psi>. Let me compute each of these.

First, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). Similarly for the other terms. So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we can compute the expectation value of each component.

Let me compute <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi>, <psi| S1^y S2^y |psi>, and <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>, and then add them up.

Similarly for the other cross terms.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, note that the state psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. So, it's an equally weighted combination of the three possible configurations with two up and one down.

Therefore, let's think about the expectation value of S1·S2 in this state.

Since the state is symmetric under permutation of particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 should be the same as S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, the expectation value of each cross term will be equal.

So, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = E, and then <psi| S1·S3 |psi> = E, and <psi| S2·S3 |psi> = E. Therefore, the total cross terms contribute 2E + 2E + 2E = 6E.

So, now I need to compute E = <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

To compute E, let me note that S1·S2 can be written as (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ^2, as we derived earlier.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value directly.

Alternatively, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). So, the expectation value E can be written as:

E = (1/2) [ <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi> + <psi| S1^y S2^y |psi> + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> ]

So, I need to compute each of these three terms.

Given that, let's recall that the Pauli matrices for the spin operators are:

S_i^x = (ħ/2) σ_i^x, S_i^y = (ħ/2) σ_i^y, S_i^z = (ħ/2) σ_i^z.

Therefore, S1^x S2^x = (ħ^2 /4) σ1^x σ2^x, and similarly for the others.

So, E = (ħ^2 /8) [ <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> + <psi| σ1^y σ2^y |psi> + <psi| σ1^z σ2^z |psi> ]

So, if I can compute each of these matrix elements, I can find E.

Let me note that the state psi is a symmetric combination of the three basis states with two up and one down.

Let me denote the basis states as |a b c>, where a, b, c are the spin states of particles 1, 2, 3, respectively, either up or down.

So, psi is (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Therefore, to compute <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi>, I need to take the inner product of psi with σ1^x σ2^x psi.

Similarly for the others.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that σ1^x and σ2^x are spin exchange operators.

Wait, let me first compute <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi>.

First, note that σ1^x is the spin exchange operator between particles 1 and 2, flipping their spins. Similarly for σ2^x.

Wait, actually, σ1^x acting on particle 1 and σ2^x acting on particle 2. So, σ1^x σ2^x is the operator that flips the spin of particle 1 and particle 2 simultaneously.

Wait, the product of σ1^x and σ2^x can be represented as a tensor product: σ1^x ⊗ I3 ⊗ I3 for σ1^x σ2^x σ3^x? Hmm, no, perhaps.

Wait, actually, S1^x = (ħ/2) σ1^x, acting only on particle 1, and similarly for S2^x on particle 2.

Therefore, σ1^x and σ2^x are operators acting on different particles, so their product σ1^x σ2^x acts on particles 1 and 2, leaving particle 3 unchanged.

Therefore, to compute <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi>, I can consider the action of σ1^x σ2^x on each term in psi.

Let me write psi as |a b c> where a, b, c ∈ {↑, ↓}.

But for simplicity, let me represent each state in terms of their spin components.

Each term in psi is a product state with two up spins and one down spin.

So, |↑↑↓⟩: particle 1 up, particle 2 up, particle 3 down.

|↑↓↑⟩: particle 1 up, particle 2 down, particle 3 up.

|↓↑↑⟩: particle 1 down, particle 2 up, particle 3 up.

Let me compute σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩.

First, σ1^x flips the spin of particle 1. So, acting on |↑↑↓⟩, it becomes |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, σ2^x flips the spin of particle 2. So, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = σ1^x (σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ ) = σ1^x |↑↓↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩: first, σ2^x acts on |↑↓↑⟩, which gives |↑↑↑⟩, then σ1^x acts, flipping the first spin: |↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩: σ2^x acts on |↓↑↑⟩, giving |↓↓↑⟩, then σ1^x acts, flipping the first spin: |↑↓↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1^x σ2^x psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ + σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ ] = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ].

Wait, let me write that out:

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = σ1^x (σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ ) = σ1^x |↑↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩

σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ = σ1^x (σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ ) = σ1^x |↓↓↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩

Therefore, σ1^x σ2^x psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ].

Now, let's compute the inner product <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi>:

<psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] * (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ]

So, that's (1/3) times the sum over the inner products of each basis state with the transformed states.

Let me compute each term:

<↑↑↓| ↓↑↓> = 0, because only the first and second particles are flipped. The third is down in both.

Wait, no, actually, each basis state is three particles. Wait, no— wait, each state is a product of three spins. So, |a b c> and |d e f> are both three-spin states.

So, for the first term:

<↑↑↓| ↓↑↓> = <↑↑↓| ↓↑↓> = (↑|↓) * (↑|↑) * (↓|↓) = 0 * 1 * 1 = 0

Similarly, <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑> = <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑> = 0 * 1 * 1 = 0

And <↑↑↓| ↑↓↑> = <↑↑↓| ↑↓↑> = 1 * 0 * 1 = 0

Similarly, for the second term:

<↑↓↑| ↓↑↓> = <↑↓↑| ↓↑↓> = 0 * 1 * 1 = 0

<↑↓↑| ↓↑↑> = 0 * 1 * 1 = 0

<↑↓↑| ↑↓↑> = <↑↓↑| ↑↓↑> = 1 * 0 * 1 = 0

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no.

Wait, <↑↓↑| ↑↓↑> is actually 1, because each component matches.

Wait, let me clarify. Each state is |a b c> where a, b, c are the spin of particle 1, 2, 3.

So, |↑↑↓> is (↑, ↑, ↓), |↓↑↓> is (↓, ↑, ↓), |↓↑↑> is (↓, ↑, ↑), |↑↓↑> is (↑, ↓, ↑).

So, for <↑↑↓| ↓↑↓>:

The first spin is ↑ vs. ↓: 0.

Second spin is ↑ vs. ↑: 1.

Third spin is ↓ vs. ↓: 1.

So, it's 0 * 1 * 1 = 0.

Similarly, <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑>:

First spin ↑ vs. ↓: 0.

Second spin ↑ vs. ↑: 1.

Third spin ↓ vs. ↑: 0.

So, 0 * 1 * 0 = 0.

<↑↑↓| ↑↓↑>:

First spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Second spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

Third spin ↓ vs. ↑:0

Thus, 1 * 0 * 0 = 0.

Similarly, <↑↓↑| ↓↑↓>:

First spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

Second spin ↓ vs. ↑:0

Third spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

So, 0.

<↑↓↑| ↓↑↑>:

First spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

Second spin ↓ vs. ↑:0

Third spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Thus, 0 * 0 *1=0.

<↑↓↑| ↑↓↑>:

All spins match: 1.

Similarly, <↓↑↑| ↓↑↓>:

First spin ↓ vs. ↓:1

Second spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Third spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

So, 1*1*0=0.

<↓↑↑| ↓↑↑>:

First spin ↓ vs. ↓:1

Second spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Third spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Thus, 1*1*1=1.

<↓↑↑| ↑↓↑>:

First spin ↓ vs. ↑:0

Second spin ↑ vs. ↓:0

Third spin ↑ vs. ↑:1

Thus, 0*0*1=0.

So, putting it all together, the inner product becomes:

(1/3) times [ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 ] = (1/3)*1 = 1/3.

Wait, let me count again.

Wait, the inner product is:

Sum over i,j of <a b c|d e f> where d e f are the images under σ1^x σ2^x.

So, for each term in psi's dual, which is <↑↑↓|, <↑↓↑|, <↓↑↑|, and the transformed |psi> is |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩, so the dual is projecting onto these. So, each dual is:

<↑↑↓|, which is (↑, ↑, ↓), dot product with (↓, ↑, ↓): that's 0*1*1 = 0.

Similarly, <↑↑↓| with (↓, ↑, ↑): 0*1*0=0.

<↑↑↓| with (↑, ↓, ↑): 0*0*0=0.

Similarly for the next dual vector: <↑↓↑|, which is (↑, ↓, ↑). Dot product with (↓, ↑, ↓): 0*1*0=0. With (↓, ↑, ↑): 0*0*1=0. With (↑, ↓, ↑): 1*0*1=0.

Third dual vector: <↓↑↑|, which is (↓, ↑, ↑). Dot product with (↓, ↑, ↓):1*1*0=0. With (↓, ↑, ↑):1*0*1=0. With (↑, ↓, ↑):0*0*1=0.

Wait a minute, hold on, that can't be right because earlier when I computed σ1^x σ2^x psi, I thought it was (1/sqrt(3))[ |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ], but when computing the inner product, it seems that all the overlaps are zero except for one.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check what each term is.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

When σ1^x σ2^x acts on |↑↑↓⟩, it becomes |↓↑↓⟩. Similarly, acting on |↑↓↑⟩ gives |↓↑↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩ gives |↑↓↑⟩.

So, the transformed state is (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ].

Now, the original psi is (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Therefore, the inner product is the sum over each term in psi's dual times each term in the transformed psi.

So, <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> is (1/3) [ <↑↑↓|↓↑↓> + <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> + <↓↑↑|↑↓↑> + <↑↑↓|↓↑↑> + <↑↓↑|↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑|↓↑↓> ]

Wait, not quite. Each term in the dual is multiplied by each term in the transformed |psi>, so it's (1/3) times the sum over i, j of <a b c|d e f>, where |a b c> are the original states and |d e f> are the transformed states.

So, the six terms are:

1. <↑↑↓| ↓↑↓> = 0
2. <↑↑↓| ↓↑↑> = 0
3. <↑↑↓| ↑↓↑> = 0
4. <↑↓↑| ↓↑↓> = 0
5. <↑↓↑| ↓↑↑> = 0
6. <↑↓↑| ↑↓↑> = 1
7. <↓↑↑| ↓↑↓> = 0
8. <↓↑↑| ↓↑↑> = 1
9. <↓↑↑| ↑↓↑> = 0

Wait, that's nine terms? Wait, no, the correct expansion is:

Each dual basis vector is multiplied by each transformed basis vector.

So, for <psi| which is (1/sqrt(3))( <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ) and |psi> transformed is (1/sqrt(3))( |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ), then the inner product is:

(1/3) [ <↑↑↓|↓↑↓⟩ + <↑↑↓|↓↑↑⟩ + <↑↑↓|↑↓↑⟩ + <↑↓↑|↓↑↓⟩ + <↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ + <↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ + <↓↑↑|↓↑↓⟩ + <↓↑↑|↓↑↑⟩ + <↓↑↑|↑↓↑⟩ ]

Now, as I compute each of these:

1. <↑↑↓|↓↑↓> = 0
2. <↑↑↓|↓↑↑> = 0
3. <↑↑↓|↑↓↑> = 0
4. <↑↓↑|↓↑↓> = 0
5. <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> = 0
6. <↑↓↑|↑↓↑> = 1
7. <↓↑↑|↓↑↓> = 0
8. <↓↑↑|↓↑↑> = 1
9. <↓↑↑|↑↓↑> = 0

So, only two terms survive: term 6 and term 8, both give 1. Therefore, the inner product is (1/3)(1 + 1) = 2/3.

Therefore, <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = 2/3.

Wait, but wait, in the previous calculation, I thought it was 1/3, but now I get 2/3. I think I made a mistake earlier.

Because when you have each term in psi's dual multiplied by each term in the transformed psi, you have 3x3 = 9 terms, but only two of them give 1, so total is 2, multiplied by (1/3), so 2/3.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with my previous result. Let me confirm again.

Yes, because each of the dual vectors is (1/sqrt(3)) times three basis states, and the transformed psi is also (1/sqrt(3)) times three basis states. So, when you take the inner product, it's (1/3) times the sum over all overlaps.

Each overlap where the original and transformed basis states match is 1, and there are two such overlaps: <↑↓↑|↑↓↑> and <↓↑↑|↓↑↑>, right? So, each contributes 1, so total is 2, multiplied by 1/3, gives 2/3.

Therefore, <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = 2/3.

But wait, hang on, no. Let me see:

Wait, the inner product is:

<psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓|↓↑↓> + <↑↑↓|↓↑↑> + <↑↑↓|↑↓↑> + <↑↓↑|↓↑↓> + <↑↓↑|↓↑↑> + <↑↓↑|↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑|↓↑↓> + <↓↑↑|↓↑↑> + <↓↑↑|↑↓↑> ]

Which, as above, gives two terms equal to 1, so 2*(1) + 7*0 = 2.

Thus, 2*(1/3) = 2/3. So, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x is 2/3.

Similarly, we can compute for σ1^y σ2^y and σ1^z σ2^z.

But wait, hold on. For the expectation values of σ1^y σ2^y and σ1^z σ2^z, we need to compute similar terms.

But for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ_i·σ_j for the singlet state is -3, but in our case, we're dealing with a triplet-like state.

Wait, but our state is not the singlet, it's a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down.

Wait, another approach: for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S=0, so S·S = 0(0+1)ħ^2 = 0, and the triplet states have S=1, so S·S = 2ħ^2.

Wait, but in our case, we are dealing with three particles, so it's not just two particles. So, perhaps we can't directly apply the two-particle result.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

But for two-particle states, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

Given that S1·S2 has expectation value (S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 * ħ^2, where S is the total spin of the two particles.

But in our case, the two particles are 1 and 2, and their combined spin is entangled with particle 3.

Wait, but since the state is symmetric, maybe the two-particle subsystems have the same properties as a singlet or triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps for the two-particle part, the average spin is 1/2 for each.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, going back, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of the particles. Therefore, each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) should have the same expectation value for S_i·S_j.

Therefore, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = <psi| S1·S3 |psi> = <psi| S2·S3 |psi> = same value, say E.

Therefore, the cross terms in the expectation value of S_total^2 are 6E.

We computed E for σ1^x σ2^x, which is 2/3. However, that was for the Pauli matrices, so let's relate that.

Wait, actually, in the computation above, I found that <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = 2/3. However, S1^x S2^x is (ħ/2)^2 σ1^x σ2^x, so the expectation value is (ħ^2 /4) * 2/3 = ħ^2 /6.

Wait, but hold on, I think I messed up somewhere.

Wait, let me recap: S1^x = (ħ/2) σ1^x, so S1^x S2^x = (ħ^2 /4) σ1^x σ2^x.

Therefore, <psi| S1^x S2^x |psi> = (ħ^2 /4) <psi| σ1^x σ2^x |psi> = (ħ^2 /4)*(2/3) = ħ^2 /6.

Similarly, for S1^y S2^y and S1^z S2^z.

Wait, but do these have the same expectation value?

Wait, for σ1^y σ2^y, let's compute <psi| σ1^y σ2^y |psi>.

Wait, using the same approach as above, compute σ1^y σ2^y |↑↑↓⟩.

σ1^y flips the spin of particle 1 from up to down with a phase factor of -i, and σ2^y flips the spin of particle 2 from up to down with a phase factor of -i.

So, acting on |↑↑↓⟩: σ1^y turns ↑ into -i ↓, and σ2^y turns ↑ into -i ↓.

Therefore, σ1^y σ2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i)^2 |↓↓↓⟩ = (-1) |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, let's compute σ1^y σ2^y |↑↓↑⟩:

σ1^y turns ↑ into -i ↓, σ2^y turns ↓ into -i ↑.

So, σ1^y σ2^y |↑↓↑⟩ = (-i)(-i) |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1) |↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y |↓↑↑⟩:

σ1^y turns ↓ into -i ↑, σ2^y turns ↑ into -i ↓.

So, σ1^y σ2^y |↓↑↑⟩ = (-i)(-i) |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1) |↑↓↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1^y σ2^y psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ (-1)|↓↓↓⟩ + (-1)|↓↑↑⟩ + (-1)|↑↓↑⟩ ] = (-1/sqrt(3)) [ |↓↓↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ].

Therefore, <psi| σ1^y σ2^y |psi> is (1/sqrt
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall what spin operators do. Each Si is a vector operator, which in spin 1/2 particles, can be expressed as vectors. For spin 1/2 particles, the spin operator S_i has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z, each of which can take values ±ħ/2 for up and down. 

The dot product S_i·S_j is equal to (1/2)(S_i^+S_j^- + S_i^-S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But for spin 1/2, the dot product can also be expressed in terms of the total spin. Wait, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2. Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, so S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ^2 each, but actually, wait, no. Wait, S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2]. Yeah, that's the identity. So for two spin 1/2 particles, since S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, then (S_i + S_j)^2 can be (0 or 1)ħ^2 for singlet or triplet. 

But in our case, H is a sum of three such dot products: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So maybe I can express H in terms of the total spin squared.

Wait, let's define S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So from that equation, we can solve for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So then H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ).

Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, so H = A*( (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2 ) / 2 ) = A*(S_total^2/(2) - 9A/8 * ħ^2 ). Wait, no, let me do that step by step.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ) / 2 )

Each S_i^2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

So H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2 ) / 2 ). Therefore, H = (A/2)*S_total^2 - (9A/8)ħ^2.

Thus, H can be expressed in terms of S_total^2.

Now, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the given state psi, I can find the eigenvalue of H.

The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). Let's see what the total spin of this state is.

Each term in psi is a product of spins, with two up and one down. So, each term has two spins up and one spin down. Let's try to write this state in terms of total spin eigenstates.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute S_total^2 acting on psi and see if it's an eigenvalue, which would confirm whether psi is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note the symmetry of the state. Let's see: the state is symmetric under permutation of particles 1, 2, and 3. Because the state is a sum of all cyclic permutations where two are up and one is down. So, swapping any two particles would just permute the terms in the sum, so the state is symmetric.

So, the state has total spin symmetry. Let's think about the possible total spin states. For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

Wait, the maximum total spin is 3/2, and the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2 because adding three 1/2 spins.

But, if the state is symmetric under permutation, does that mean it's in a higher total spin state?

Wait, when the state is symmetric under permutation, it's likely part of the triplet state. Let me recall that.

When all three spins are up, that's a symmetric state with maximum total spin 3/2. Similarly, other symmetric states can have total spin 1/2.

But our state has two ups and one down. Hmm, so it's a state with two spins up and one spin down.

Wait, if the state is symmetric, meaning that all particles are treated equally, so having two up and one down can be part of the symmetric subspace. Let me think.

Wait, for three particles, the subspace with two spins up and one down can be either symmetric or antisymmetric. Hmm, in the case of three particles, the two up and one down state can be either symmetric or antisymmetric depending on how the down is arranged.

Wait, but our state is symmetric. So, how does that work?

Wait, no, the state is written as a sum of terms where each term has one down and two ups, each in a different position. So, it's symmetric under permutation because permuting particles 1,2,3 just cycles the terms.

So, the state is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. What's the total spin of such a state?

Hmm. Let me think in terms of how total spin acts on this state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S_total^2 acting on psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider acting on each term in psi with S_total^2.

Wait, let's take a term, say up1 up2 down3. Let's compute S_total^2 acting on this.

First, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, so S_total^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 + 2*(sum of dot products). Which is the same as 9/4 ħ^2 + 2H, because H is A*(sum of dot products). Wait, no: H = A*(sum of dot products). So, sum of dot products is H / A.

Wait, from earlier, we have that sum of dot products = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2. So, 2*(sum of dot products) = S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2.

Thus, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(sum of dot products).

But in any case, maybe it's better to compute S_total^2 acting on a term.

So, let's take a term in psi, say |up1 up2 down3>. Let's compute S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3>.

First, S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so let's expand that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

Wait, so let's compute S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Now, since each S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ^2, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ^2.

Now, let's compute S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 on the state |up1 up2 down3>.

Compute S1·S2 |up1 up2 down3>:

First, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) + S1^z S2^z.

So, let's compute each part.

Compute S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^z |up1> = (ħ/2)|up1>, and S2^z |up2> = (ħ/2)|up2>, so S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2)|up1 up2 down3> = (ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3>.

Now, S1^+ S2^- |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^+ |up1> = 0, since it's spin up. S2^- |up2> = ħ|down2>. So, S1^+ S2^- |up1 up2 down3> = 0 * |down1> |down2> = 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^- |up1> = ħ|down1>, S2^+ |up2> = 0. So, S1^- S2^+ |up1 up2 down3> = ħ|down1> * 0 = 0.

Therefore, S1·S2 |up1 up2 down3> = (ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3>.

Similarly, compute S1·S3 |up1 up2 down3>:

This is (S1^+ S3^- + S1^- S3^+ )/2 + S1^z S3^z.

Compute each part.

First, S1^z S3^z |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^z |up1> = ħ/2, S3^z |down3> = -ħ/2, so their product is -ħ^2/4. Thus, S1^z S3^z |up1 up2 down3> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3>.

Now, S1^+ S3^- |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^+ |up1> = 0, so this term is 0.

S1^- S3^+ |up1 up2 down3>:

S1^- |up1> = ħ|down1>, S3^+ |down3> = ħ|up3>. So, this gives ħ |down1 up2 up3>.

Therefore, (S1^+ S3^- + S1^- S3^+ )/2 |up1 up2 down3> = (0 + ħ |down1 up2 up3>)/2 = (ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3>.

Therefore, S1·S3 |up1 up2 down3> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3>.

Similarly, compute S2·S3 |up1 up2 down3>:

Again, (S2^+ S3^- + S2^- S3^+ )/2 + S2^z S3^z.

Compute each part.

S2^z S3^z |up1 up2 down3>:

S2^z |up2> = ħ/2, S3^z |down3> = -ħ/2, so their product is (-ħ^2/4). So, S2^z S3^z |up1 up2 down3> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3>.

S2^+ S3^- |up1 up2 down3>:

S2^+ |up2> = 0, so this term is 0.

S2^- S3^+ |up1 up2 down3>:

S2^- |up2> = ħ |down2>, S3^+ |down3> = ħ |up3>. So, this gives ħ |up1 down2 up3>.

Therefore, (S2^+ S3^- + S2^- S3^+ )/2 |up1 up2 down3> = (0 + ħ |up1 down2 up3>)/2 = (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>.

Thus, S2·S3 |up1 up2 down3> = (-ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>.

Now, putting it all together, the action of S_total^2 on |up1 up2 down3> is:

S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |up1 up2 down3>

= (9/4 ħ^2) + 2[ (ħ^2/4)|up1 up2 down3> + (-ħ^2/4 + ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> + (-ħ^2/4 + ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3> ]

Wait, hold on. Wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, no, let me approach it step by step.

Wait, S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2] |up1 up2 down3> + 2[S1·S2 |up1 up2 down3> + S1·S3 |up1 up2 down3> + S2·S3 |up1 up2 down3>]

We have already computed S1·S2 |...> = (ħ^2/4)|...>

S1·S3 |...> = (-ħ^2/4)|...> + (ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3>

S2·S3 |...> = (-ħ^2/4)|...> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>

Therefore, adding them together:

[ (ħ^2/4) + (-ħ^2/4 + ħ/2) + (-ħ^2/4 + ħ/2) ] |...>

So, combining the terms:

For |up1 up2 down3>:

(ħ^2/4) + (-ħ^2/4) + (-ħ^2/4) = ( - ħ^2/4 )

And the cross terms:

( ħ/2 |down1 up2 up3> + ħ/2 |up1 down2 up3> )

So, overall:

S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = (9/4 ħ^2 - ħ^2 /4 ) |up1 up2 down3> + ( ħ/2 |down1 up2 up3> + ħ/2 |up1 down2 up3> )

Simplify:

(9/4 - 1/4) = 8/4 = 2, so 2 ħ^2 |up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> )

So, S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = 2 ħ^2 |up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> )

Similarly, if we compute S_total^2 acting on |down1 up2 up3> and |up1 down2 up3>, we can see a pattern.

Let me compute S_total^2 |down1 up2 up3>:

Similarly, compute each S_i·S_j term.

Compute S1·S2 |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^z S2^z |down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>

S1^+ S2^- |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^+ |down1> = ħ |up1>, S2^- |up2> = ħ |down2>. So, it becomes ħ |up1 down2 up3>.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^- |down1> = 0, so this term is 0.

So, (S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ )/2 |...> = (ħ |up1 down2 up3>)/2.

Therefore, S1·S2 |down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>.

Similarly, compute S1·S3 |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^z S3^z |down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>.

S1^+ S3^- |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^+ |down1> = ħ |up1>, S3^- |up3> = ħ |down3>. So, ħ |up1 down2 down3>.

S1^- S3^+ |down1 up2 up3>:

S1^- |down1> = 0, so 0.

Thus, (S1^+ S3^- + S1^- S3^+ )/2 |...> = (ħ |up1 down2 down3>)/2.

Therefore, S1·S3 |down1 up2 up3> = (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 down3>.

Similarly, compute S2·S3 |down1 up2 up3>:

S2^z S3^z |down1 up2 up3> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> = (ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3>.

S2^+ S3^- |down1 up2 up3>:

S2^+ |up2> = 0, so 0.

S2^- S3^+ |down1 up2 up3>:

S2^- |up2> = ħ |down2>, S3^+ |up3> = ħ |down3>. So, ħ |down1 down2 down3>.

Thus, (S2^+ S3^- + S2^- S3^+ )/2 |...> = (ħ |down1 down2 down3>)/2.

Therefore, S2·S3 |down1 up2 up3> = (ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|down1 down2 down3>.

So, putting it all together:

S_total^2 |down1 up2 up3> = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |down1 up2 up3>

= (9/4 ħ^2) + 2[ (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3> + (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 down3> + (ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|down1 down2 down3> ]

Wait, let me correct that. Wait, the terms are:

From S1·S2: (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>

From S1·S3: (-ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 down3>

From S2·S3: (ħ^2/4)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|down1 down2 down3>

So, adding them together:

For |down1 up2 up3>:

(-ħ^2/4 - ħ^2/4 + ħ^2/4 ) = (-ħ^2/4)

For |up1 down2 up3>:

(ħ/2)

For |up1 down2 down3>:

(ħ/2)

For |down1 down2 down3>:

(ħ/2)

Thus, S_total^2 |down1 up2 up3> = (9/4 ħ^2 - ħ^2 /4 ) |down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |up1 down2 up3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> )

Similarly, 9/4 - 1/4 = 8/4 = 2, so 2 ħ^2 |down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |up1 down2 up3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> )

Similarly, if we compute S_total^2 on |up1 down2 up3>, we'd get the same result:

S_total^2 |up1 down2 up3> = 2 ħ^2 |up1 down2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> )

So, now, going back to the original state psi: (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) / sqrt(3).

Therefore, let's compute S_total^2 |psi>:

S_total^2 |psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) [ S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> + S_total^2 |up1 down2 up3> + S_total^2 |down1 up2 up3> ]

From above, each S_total^2 term is:

2 ħ^2 |term> + (ħ/2)( sum of other terms )

So, let's write each component:

First term: S_total^2 |up1 up2 down3> = 2 ħ^2 |up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> )

Second term: S_total^2 |up1 down2 up3> = 2 ħ^2 |up1 down2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> )

Third term: S_total^2 |down1 up2 up3> = 2 ħ^2 |down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |up1 down2 up3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> )

Now, summing them up:

Sum = [2 ħ^2 |up1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ) ] +

[2 ħ^2 |up1 down2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> ) ] +

[2 ħ^2 |down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)( |up1 down2 up3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> ) ]

Let's factor out the constants:

First, the terms with 2 ħ^2:

2 ħ^2 ( |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> )

Then, the terms with (ħ/2):

For the first term: (ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3>

Second term: (ħ/2)|down1 up2 up3> + (ħ/2)|down1 up2 down3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 down3>

Third term: (ħ/2)|up1 down2 up3> + (ħ/2)|up1 down2 down3> + (ħ/2)|down1 down2 down3>

So, let's collect all (ħ/2) terms:

For |down1 up2 up3>:

(ħ/2) from first term and (ħ/2) from second term: total ħ.

For |up1 down2 up3>:

(ħ/2) from first term and (ħ/2) from third term: total ħ.

For |down1 up2 down3>:

(ħ/2) from second term.

For |up1 down2 down3>:

(ħ/2) from second term and (ħ/2) from third term: total ħ.

For |down1 down2 down3>:

(ħ/2) from third term.

So, in total, the (ħ/2) terms add up to:

|down1 up2 up3> * ħ + |up1 down2 up3> * ħ + |down1 up2 down3> * ħ + |up1 down2 down3> * ħ + |down1 down2 down3> * (ħ/2)

Wait, actually, let's list all:

- |down1 up2 up3> appears in first and second terms: 2*(ħ/2) = ħ

- |up1 down2 up3> appears in first and third terms: 2*(ħ/2) = ħ

- |down1 up2 down3> appears in second term: (ħ/2)

- |up1 down2 down3> appears in second and third terms: 2*(ħ/2) = ħ

- |down1 down2 down3> appears in third term: (ħ/2)

So, total (ħ/2) terms:

= ħ |down1 up2 up3> + ħ |up1 down2 up3> + (ħ/2)|down1 up2 down3> + ħ |up1 down2 down3> + (ħ/2)|down1 down2 down3>

So, combining everything, S_total^2 |psi> is:

(2 ħ^2) * |psi> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> )

But note that |psi> is (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) / sqrt(3)

So, let's write S_total^2 |psi> as:

2 ħ^2 |psi> + (ħ/2)( |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> )

Wait, to check, let me write this as:

= 2 ħ^2 |psi> + (ħ/2)[ (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) + (|down1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 down3> + |down1 down2 down3> ) ]

But note that the first group is |psi> times sqrt(3). So:

= 2 ħ^2 |psi> + (ħ/2)[ |psi> * sqrt(3) + (|down1 down2 down3> ) ]

Wait, let me see. The first group is indeed |psi> multiplied by sqrt(3). Let me check: |psi> is (|a> + |b> + |c>)/sqrt(3), where |a> = |up1 up2 down3>, |b> = |up1 down2 up3>, |c> = |down1 up2 up3>. So, |a> + |b> + |c> = sqrt(3)|psi>.

Therefore, the first group [ |a> + |b> + |c> ] = sqrt(3) |psi>.

So, we have:

S_total^2 |psi> = 2 ħ^2 |psi> + (ħ/2)( sqrt(3) |psi> + |d> )

Where |d> = |down1 down2 down3>.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (2 ħ^2 + (ħ sqrt(3))/2 ) |psi> + (ħ/2)|d>.

Hmm. So, unless |d> is part of the span of |psi>, which it isn't, because |d> has all three spins down, while |psi> has two up and one down.

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> is not a scalar multiple of |psi>, which suggests that |psi> is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, and hence not an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but the answer says it is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 2/3 A ħ^2. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe instead of computing S_total^2, I can compute H directly on |psi>.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j in state |psi>, then sum them up.

Let me try that.

First, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Similarly, compute <psi| S1·S3 |psi> and <psi| S2·S3 |psi>, then multiply by A and sum them.

So, the expectation value of H is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

First, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So, expectation value <psi| S1·S2 |psi> is:

(1/2)( <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> + <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> ) + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>

Compute each term.

First term: <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi>

S1^+ acting on |psi> will lower spin 1: S1^+ |up1> = 0, since it's spin up. So S1^+ |psi> = S1^+ ( |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) / sqrt(3)

= 0 + 0 + S1^+ |down1 up2 up3> / sqrt(3)

= [ ħ |up1 up2 up3> ] / sqrt(3)

Then, S2^- acting on this gives S2^- |up1 up2 up3> = ħ |up1 down2 up3> / sqrt(3)

Thus, <psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> = <psi| ħ |up1 down2 up3> / sqrt(3)

= (ħ / sqrt(3)) <psi | up1 down2 up3> = (ħ / sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(3)) = ħ / 3

Because <psi | up1 down2 up3> is the coefficient of |up1 down2 up3> in psi, which is 1/sqrt(3).

Similarly, the second term: <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi>

S1^- acting on |psi> will raise spin 1: S1^- |up1> = ħ |down1>, so S1^- |psi> = (1/sqrt(3))[ S1^- |up1 up2 down3> + S1^- |up1 down2 up3> + S1^- |down1 up2 up3> ]

= (1/sqrt(3))[ ħ |down1 up2 down3> + 0 + 0 ]

= ħ |down1 up2 down3> / sqrt(3)

Then, S2^+ acting on this gives S2^+ |down1 up2 down3> = ħ |down1 up2 up3> / sqrt(3)

Thus, <psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> = (ħ / sqrt(3)) <psi | down1 up2 up3> = (ħ / sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(3)) = ħ / 3

So, the first two terms contribute (1/2)( ħ/3 + ħ/3 ) = (1/2)(2ħ/3) = ħ/3.

Now, compute the third term: <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>

S1^z S2^z |psi> = S1^z S2^z ( |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ) / sqrt(3)

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |up1 up2 down3> = ( ħ/2 )( -ħ/2 ) |up1 up2 down3> = (- ħ^2 /4 ) |up1 up2 down3>

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |up1 down2 up3> = ( ħ/2 )( ħ/2 ) |up1 down2 up3> = ( ħ^2 /4 ) |up1 down2 up3>

S
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H and if so, find its energy. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state ψ is provided as ψ = (1/√3)*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). 

First, I recall that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are for each particle, and their dot products S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of spin states. I remember that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. Maybe that could help, but not sure yet.

Alternatively, another way to think about S_i·S_j is that it's related to the total spin squared operator: S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding this gives S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, that means S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, substituting back into H, we have H = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Similarly, S2^2 and S3^2 are also (3/4)ħ² each. Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 9/4 ħ². 

So then, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ). Therefore, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²). Now, if the state ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it would be an eigenstate of H. So the crucial question is: Is ψ an eigenstate of S_total^2?

To figure this out, I need to find the total spin S_total. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The state ψ is symmetric under exchange of particles? Wait, let's check. The state ψ is a sum of three terms: each term has two up spins and one down spin. The particles are distinguishable by their indices, but the state is symmetric under permutation of particles. Because each term has two spins up and one down, and permuting particles doesn't change the number of up and down spins. So, the state is symmetric under permutation.

For three particles, the symmetric states are either the totally symmetric state (which is the all-up state), or states with two up and one down, which is our case. The symmetric states with two up and one down can have total spin S=1/2 or S=3/2. Wait, how do I figure that out?

I think that the total spin S can be determined by considering the possible pair couplings. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute S_total^2 acting on ψ and see whether it gives an eigenvalue.

Alternatively, we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state ψ, which might help determine the possible eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since all the terms in ψ have two spins up and one spin down, the total spin z-component (S_total^z) is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So the state ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^z with eigenvalue (1/2)ħ.

But the eigenstates of S_total^2 are the states with definite total spin S, which are the eigenstates of S_total^2 with eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ². So, if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it must correspond to a state with a specific S.

Given that ψ is symmetric, it can't be a triplet state (which is symmetric) with S=1/2 or S=3/2. Wait, triplet states (S=1/2) for three particles? No, wait. For two particles, triplet states have S=1, but for three particles, the symmetric states can have S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The state ψ is a sum of three configurations, each with two up spins and one down. Let me try to find the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

Recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But since we have the expression for H in terms of S_total^2, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the eigenvalue of S_total^2 on the state ψ by looking at the number of ways to add spins.

Wait, since each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down, the total spin S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So the possible S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But if all the three particles are spin-up, then S_z is 3/2. But our state has S_z = 1/2, so it's a state with lower S.

But to find the exact S, maybe we can use the fact that S_total^2 ψ = S(S+1)ħ² ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state ψ, which might help us determine the eigenvalue.

So, let's compute ⟨ψ| S_total^2 |ψ⟩.

First, let's note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). 

We already know that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ² each, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = (9/4)ħ².

Then, S_total^2 = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (H + (A/2)*(9/4 ħ²))/A = H/(A) + (9/8)ħ².

But perhaps this is getting more complicated. Maybe it's better to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩ directly.

But computing S_total^2 is going to involve terms like S1·S2, which might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe we can find ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩, then sum them up and multiply by 2.

So, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩). 

We already know ⟨S1^2⟩ = ⟨S2^2⟩ = ⟨S3^2⟩ = (3/4)ħ² each, so their sum is (9/4)ħ².

Thus, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Therefore, if I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩, I can find ⟨S_total^2⟩.

Note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Alternatively, for the expectation value, it's easier to compute ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = ⟨S_i^x S_j^x⟩ + ⟨S_i^y S_j^y⟩ + ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩. 

Given that, maybe I can compute each of these terms.

Given the state ψ, which is (1/√3)(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑). So, each term is a product state with two up spins and one down spin.

Since the state is symmetric, permutations of particles don't affect the state. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ should be the same as ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩, due to the symmetry.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩. Because of the symmetry, this will be the same as ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩.

To compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, let's note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ + ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ + ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩.

We can compute each of these expectation values.

First, let's compute ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩. In the state ψ, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, for S1^z S2^z, we have:

For each term in ψ, say ↑↑↓, the first two spins are up, the third is down. So, for the term ↑↑↓:

- S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩
- S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, for the term ↑↓↑:

- S1^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↓↑⟩
- S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/2)ħ |↑↓↑⟩

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. S2 acts on the second particle. In the term ↑↓↑, S2^z acts on the second spin, which is down, so S2^z ↓ = (-1/2)↓.

So, S1^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↓↑⟩
S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/2)ħ |↑↓↑⟩

Thus, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, for the term ↓↑↑:

- S1^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)ħ |↓↑↑⟩
- S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↓↑↑⟩

Thus, S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2)ħ² |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↓↑↑⟩.

So, when we compute the expectation value ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩, we have:

(1/3) [ ⟨↑↑↓ | S1^z S2^z | ↑↑↓ ⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑ | S1^z S2^z | ↑↓↑ ⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑ | S1^z S2^z | ↓↑↑ ⟩ ]

From above, each term inside the brackets is (1/4), (-1/4), and (-1/4) respectively, multiplied by |term⟩.

But since ψ is a normalized state, the expectation value is (1/3) times the sum of these:

(1/3)[ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] = (1/3)( -1/4 ) = -1/12.

Therefore, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (-1/12)ħ².

Wait, but hold on, in each term:

Wait, no. Wait, in the term ↑↑↓, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, but when we take the inner product with ψ, which is (1/√3)(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑), we have to compute the expectation value.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me think again. The expectation value ⟨ψ| S1^z S2^z |ψ⟩ is equal to (1/3) [ ⟨↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Each term is:

⟨↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2)ħ² = (1/4)ħ²,

⟨↑↓↑| S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ²,

⟨↓↑↑| S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2)(1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

So, summing these: (1/4 - 1/4 -1/4)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

Then, the expectation value is (1/3)*(-1/4)ħ² = (-1/12)ħ².

So, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (-1/12)ħ².

Now, we need to compute ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ and ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩.

Hmm, this is more complicated. Let's recall that the expectation value of S_i^x S_j^x and S_i^y S_j^y can be expressed in terms of the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, and the triplet states are |↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, and |↓↓⟩.

In the triplet state, S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

Wait, perhaps not exactly, but maybe we can use this to find the expectation values.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that S_i^x S_j^x = (S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+)/4 + S_i^z S_j^z - (S_i^+ S_j^+ + S_i^- S_j^-)/4.

Wait, no, that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps we can express S_i^x S_j^x and S_i^y S_j^y in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the spin operators can be written as S_i^x = (ħ/2) σ_i^x, and similarly for S_i^y and S_i^z.

So, S_i^x S_j^x = (ħ^2/4) σ_i^x σ_j^x, and similarly for S_i^y S_j^y.

Thus, ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ = (ħ^2/4) ⟨σ1^x σ2^x⟩, and same for S1^y S2^y.

So, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation values of σ1^x σ2^x and σ1^y σ2^y.

The state ψ can be written in terms of the computational basis states. Let's write ψ as a vector in the basis |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, etc. Wait, but our state only includes the states with two up and one down spin. There are three such states: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

But in the computational basis, each state is a product of individual spins, so maybe we can compute the expectation values directly.

Let me represent the state ψ as a vector:

ψ = (1/√3)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

So, let's write this as a column vector:

ψ = (1/√3)[
        1, 1, 1,
        1, 1, 1,
        1, 1, 1
      ] ?

Wait, no, actually, wait. Each term corresponds to a different permutation. Wait, actually, each state |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ is a unique state in the 3-particle basis.

But for the purpose of computing the expectation value, perhaps it's better to map these states into a 3-dimensional space where each basis vector corresponds to one of these three states.

So, let's define the basis as:

|1⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩,

|2⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩,

|3⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Then, the state ψ is (1/√3)(|1⟩ + |2⟩ + |3⟩).

Now, let's compute the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x in ψ.

Note that σ1^x and σ2^x are Pauli matrices acting on the first and second qubits respectively. But in the 3-particle system, we have to consider the tensor product structure.

Wait, actually, for each basis vector |a b c⟩, where a, b, c are spins up or down, σ1^x acts on the first spin, σ2^x on the second, and σ3^x on the third. But in our case, we are only interested in σ1^x and σ2^x.

So, for each basis state |a b c⟩, σ1^x |a b c⟩ = (σ^x |a⟩) ⊗ |b⟩ ⊗ |c⟩.

Similarly, σ2^x |a b c⟩ = |a⟩ ⊗ (σ^x |b⟩) ⊗ |c⟩.

Thus, σ1^x σ2^x |a b c⟩ = (σ^x |a⟩) ⊗ (σ^x |b⟩) ⊗ |c⟩.

Therefore, in the basis |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, the action of σ1^x σ2^x can be represented as a matrix.

Let me compute the matrix elements of σ1^x σ2^x.

First, note that σ^x is a 2x2 matrix:

σ^x = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| = [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, σ1^x is acting on the first spin, σ2^x on the second.

So, for the basis |1⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, σ1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩, σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↓⟩.

Thus, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩⊗|↑↓↓⟩.

But wait, in the 3-particle basis, this would be |↓↑↓⟩⊗|↑↓↓⟩? Wait, no.

Wait, σ1^x acts on the first spin, changing |↑⟩ to |↓⟩, and σ2^x acts on the second spin, changing |↑⟩ to |↓⟩.

So, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩ (σ^x |↑⟩) ⊗ |↓⟩ (σ^x |↑⟩) ⊗ |↓⟩.

So, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓⟩|↓⟩|↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓⟩ (σ^x |↑⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩ (σ^x |↓⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩.

= |↓⟩|↑⟩|↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

And σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑⟩ (σ^x |↓⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩ (σ^x |↑⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩.

= |↑⟩|↓⟩|↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

So, in the basis |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, the action of σ1^x σ2^x is as follows:

σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = |3⟩,

σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = |1⟩,

σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = |2⟩.

Wait, let me confirm:

Wait, σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩, which corresponds to |3⟩? Wait, no, |3⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩.

Wait, no, hold on. The basis ordering is |1⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |2⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |3⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, |↓↓↓⟩ is actually not part of our basis. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is not the best. Maybe instead of working in the 3-particle basis, I can write the operators in terms of the individual spins.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x in the state ψ.

Given that ψ is (1/√3)(|1⟩ + |2⟩ + |3⟩), then ψ is a symmetric combination of the three basis states.

So, the expectation value ⟨ψ| σ1^x σ2^x |ψ⟩ is (1/3) [⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ + ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ + ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ + ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ + ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ + ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ + ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ + ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ + ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ ].

But given the action of σ1^x σ2^x, let's compute each term.

First, compute ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩:

From earlier, σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩. But |1⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩. So, the inner product ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ is ⟨↑↑↓| ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0, since they differ in all three spins.

Similarly, ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, which is |3⟩. So, ⟨2| 3 ⟩ = 0.

⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨3| 2 ⟩ = 0.

Now, the diagonal terms are zero.

Now, compute the cross terms:

⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, which is |3⟩. So, ⟨1| 3 ⟩ = 0.

⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨1| 2 ⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩, which is not in our basis, so ⟨2| ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0.

⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨2| 2 ⟩ = 1.

Wait, no: σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = ⟨2|2⟩ = 1.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me write down all the cross terms:

Compute the 9 terms:

1. ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = 0,

2. ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩.

But σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, which is |3⟩. So, ⟨1|3⟩ = 0.

3. ⟨1| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = ⟨↑↑↓| σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨1|2⟩ = 0.

4. ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩, which is not in our basis. So, ⟨2| ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0.

5. ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = 0,

6. ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = ⟨↑↓↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, which is |2⟩. So, ⟨2|2⟩ = 1.

7. ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |1⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↓↓⟩, which is not in our basis. So, ⟨3| ↓↓↓ ⟩ = 0.

8. ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = ⟨↓↑↑| σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩.

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, which is |3⟩. So, ⟨3|3⟩ = 1.

9. ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = 0.

So, summing up all the non-zero terms:

From the cross terms, only ⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ and ⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ give non-zero contributions.

Specifically:

⟨2| σ1^x σ2^x |3⟩ = 1,

⟨3| σ1^x σ2^x |2⟩ = 1.

Therefore, the total expectation value is:

(1/3)[0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0] = (1/3)(2) = 2/3.

But remember, this is for the Pauli matrices, not the spin operators. So, ⟨σ1^x σ2^x⟩ = 2/3.

But wait, no, actually, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so in terms of spin operators:

⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ = (ħ^2/4) ⟨σ1^x σ2^x⟩ = (ħ^2/4)*(2/3) = (ħ^2/6).

Similarly, ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ can be computed the same way. Let's compute it.

Compute ⟨σ1^y σ2^y⟩.

Using the same approach, let's find ⟨ψ| σ1^y σ2^y |ψ⟩.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y |a b c⟩ = (σ^y |a⟩) ⊗ (σ^y |b⟩) ⊗ |c⟩.

σ^y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so σ^y |↑⟩ = -i |↓⟩, σ^y |↓⟩ = i |↑⟩.

Thus, σ1^y σ2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-i |↓⟩) ⊗ (-i |↓⟩) ⊗ |↓⟩ = (-i)^2 |↓↓↓⟩ = (-1) |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y |↑↓↑⟩ = (-i |↓⟩) ⊗ (i |↑⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩ = (-i)(i) |↓↑↑⟩ = (1) |↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y |↓↑↑⟩ = (i |↑⟩) ⊗ (-i |↓⟩) ⊗ |↑⟩ = (i)(-i) |↑↓↑⟩ = (1) |↑↓↑⟩.

So, in our basis:

σ1^y σ2^y |1⟩ = |3⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |2⟩ = |1⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |3⟩ = |2⟩.

Therefore, similar to σ1^x σ2^x, the operator σ1^y σ2^y maps:

|1⟩ → |3⟩,

|2⟩ → |1⟩,

|3⟩ → |2⟩.

So, applying this to ψ = (|1⟩ + |2⟩ + |3⟩)/√3, we get:

σ1^y σ2^y ψ = (|3⟩ + |1⟩ + |2⟩)/√3 = ψ.

Wait, that's interesting. So, σ1^y σ2^y ψ = ψ. Therefore, ⟨ψ| σ1^y σ2^y |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1.

But wait, that can't be, because ψ is a normalized state, but σ1^y σ2^y is a Hermitian operator, so its expectation value must be real.

Wait, but let me check. If σ1^y σ2^y is acting on ψ and giving ψ again, then the expectation value is 1. But that would imply that σ1^y σ2^y has eigenvalue 1 on ψ. But wait, ψ is a symmetric state, while σ1^y σ2^y may have some symmetry.

Wait, let's verify:

Compute σ1^y σ2^y |1⟩ = |3⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |2⟩ = |1⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |3⟩ = |2⟩.

So, σ1^y σ2^y is a permutation operator that cycles the basis states |1⟩ → |3⟩ → |2⟩ → |1⟩.

So, in matrix form, it's a permutation matrix:

[0 0 1;

1 0 0;

0 1 0]

Which is a permutation matrix with a 3-cycle. So, it's a unitary operator, but not Hermitian. Wait, no, σ1^y and σ2^y are Hermitian, so their product is also Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the action on the state ψ.

Given that σ1^y σ2^y |1⟩ = |3⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |2⟩ = |1⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |3⟩ = |2⟩.

So, σ1^y σ2^y ψ = σ1^y σ2^y (|1⟩ + |2⟩ + |3⟩)/√3 = (|3⟩ + |1⟩ + |2⟩)/√3 = ψ.

Therefore, σ1^y σ2^y ψ = ψ. So, ψ is an eigenvector of σ1^y σ2^y with eigenvalue 1.

Therefore, ⟨σ1^y σ2^y⟩ = 1.

But wait, again, this seems odd because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1, but σ1^y σ2^y is a product of two Pauli matrices, so it's a 4x4 matrix with trace 0. But when restricted to the subspace spanned by ψ, it's acting as 1.

But perhaps over the entire Hilbert space, it's not, but on the subspace spanned by ψ, it acts as 1. So, in our case, the expectation value is 1.

Therefore, ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ = (ħ^2 /4) * 1 = ħ² /4.

Wait, this is possible because we have restricted ourselves to a subspace, so the expectation value can be 1.

Okay, so summarizing:

⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (-1/12)ħ²,

⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ = (ħ^2 /6),

⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ = (ħ^2 /4).

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ + ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ + ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = (ħ²/6 + ħ²/4 - ħ²/12).

Let me compute this:

First, find a common denominator, which is 12.

So,

(2/12) + (3/12) - (1/12) = (2 + 3 - 1)/12 = 4/12 = 1/3.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/3)ħ².

Similarly, due to the symmetry, ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = (1/3)ħ² each.

Therefore, the total expectation value of S1·S2 + S
--------------------------------------------------
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles, and I need to figure out if the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. If it is, I need to find its energy, and if not, calculate the expectation value of energy. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me recall the Hamiltonian given: H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The spin state is given as psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). Each term in psi seems to have two spins up and one spin down, but arranged in a symmetric way where each particle takes turn being down once.

Okay, so to determine if psi is an eigenfunction of H, I need to check if H acting on psi just scales psi by some eigenvalue. If not, then I have to compute the expectation value of H, which involves <psi|H|psi>.

But first, I should recall that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators S_i have components. Since we’re dealing with dot products, which involve S1·S2 = S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z, maybe it's helpful to express these in terms of total spin operators or find some symmetry.

Wait, actually, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is related to the total spin squared operator. Specifically, I remember that for three spins, the square of the total spin operator S_total is given by S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I rearrange this, I get S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, H can be rewritten as H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Since each S_i^2 is (ħ^2)s(s+1) for spin s, and here each particle is spin 1/2, so S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2. So, substituting, H becomes H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2. Hmm, that might be useful.

But wait, I need to find out what is the state psi. Let me write it out: psi is a symmetric combination where each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, for three particles, the number of states with two up and one down is C(3,1) = 3, which matches the expression given. So, psi is an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator?

Hmm, let me check. The state psi is symmetric in the spins. Each term has two spins up and one down, but each permutation is considered. So, is this state an eigenstate of S_total^2? Because if it is, then knowing the eigenvalue would help me figure out the expectation value of H.

Wait, to figure out if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, I need to see how S_total^2 acts on psi. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the square of the total spin, which for a state with total spin S, gives S(S+1)ħ^2.

But to do that, I need to find the total spin S of the state psi. Let me think about how the spins combine. Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin would be the combination of two up spins and one down spin.

Wait, but for two spin-up particles, their total spin can be 1 or 0 (for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states). Then the third spin is down. So, perhaps the total spin can be adding a spin-up pair (either spin 1 or 0) to the spin-down.

But is the state psi symmetric in all three particles? Let me check: if I swap any two particles, does the state remain the same? For example, swapping particle 1 and 2: the first term becomes up2*up1*down3, which is the same as the original first term. Similarly, the second term becomes up2*down1*up3, which is the same as the original third term. The third term becomes down2*up1*up3, which is the same as the original second term. So, yes, the state is symmetric under permutation of the spins. Therefore, the state is symmetric in all three spins.

This suggests that the state might be an eigenstate of S_total^2. Because symmetric states often correspond to higher total spin states.

Wait, another approach: the given state has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2? Let me think: if you have two spin-up and one spin-down, the total spin could be 1/2 or 3/2. How?

Wait, for two spin-up particles, their combined spin is 1 (triplet state) or 0 (singlet state). If you add a spin-down particle, then the total spin could be 1 + 1/2 or 0 + 1/2, but actually, you can't just add them like that. The total spin is obtained by combining all three.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the total spin squared operator acting on psi. Let me recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

But wait, earlier, I had H expressed in terms of S_total^2, so maybe using that expression for H, and then trying to compute <psi|H|psi> would be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

But first, let's try to compute the expectation value of S_total^2. Since S_total^2 is a Casimir operator, it returns eigenvalues for states with definite total spin S.

So, if I can figure out the eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ^2 for the state psi, that would give me <S_total^2>. Then, since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, I can substitute that in.

So, let's try to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi.

Given that the state psi is symmetric in all three spins, as we saw earlier, and each term has two spins up and one spin down.

But wait, what is the possible total spin S for such a state?

Wait, when you have two spins up and one spin down, how does the total spin add up? For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But given that the state is symmetric, it's more likely to have higher spin. Because symmetric states tend to have higher spin.

Wait, let me think about how the combination of spins produces the total spin.

If I have two spin-up particles and one spin-down, their combined spin could be 1 (triplet) plus spin-down 1/2.

But how do you combine the triplet (S=1) with a spin-down (S=1/2)? The result can be S=3/2 or S=1/2.

So, the possible total spins are 3/2 or 1/2.

But I need to figure out which one it is for the state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi and see if it's an eigenstate.

But computing S_total^2 explicitly might be complicated. Maybe another approach is to note that the state psi is an eigenstate of the operator N, which counts the number of spin-up particles. But since H involves dot products of spin operators, perhaps using the properties of spin states is better.

Wait, maybe if I can write the state psi in terms of the total spin states, that would help. The total spin states with S=3/2 and S=1/2.

But since the state psi is symmetric, it's more likely to be in the S=3/2 subspace.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are:

- S=3/2: there is only one state, which is symmetric and has all possible combinations of spins.

Wait, no, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2, but the number of states for each is different.

Specifically, for S=3/2, there are 5 states, and for S=1/2, there are 3 states. But wait, our state psi is a symmetric state with two spin-ups and one spin-down. So, perhaps it's in the S=1/2 subspace?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

If I have two spin-up and one spin-down, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstates of S_total^2 are the states with definite total spin S. So, to find <S_total^2> for psi, I can compute <psi|S_total^2|psi>.

But S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Since S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 are all (3/4)ħ^2, the sum is 9/4 ħ^2.

So, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2.

But earlier, I had that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so H = A*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2)/2.

Therefore, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ^2).

So, if I can compute <S_total^2> for the state psi, then I can find <H> as (A/2)(<S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ^2).

So, let's try to compute <S_total^2> for psi.

But S_total^2 is the Casimir operator, so for a state with total spin S, it gives S(S+1)ħ^2. So, if I can figure out the eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ^2 that psi has, that would be <S_total^2>.

So, is psi an eigenstate of S_total^2? If it is, then it is an eigenstate of H as well, and the energy would be (A/2)(S(S+1)ħ^2 - 9/4 ħ^2).

Wait, but I need to see if psi is in an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can figure this out by looking at the action of S_total^2 on psi. If it's an eigenstate, then S_total^2 psi = S(S+1)ħ^2 psi.

But computing S_total^2 psi would involve expanding all the terms, which might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another idea: the given state psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. So, perhaps it's an eigenstate of the permutation group.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately and then sum them up.

Since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), the expectation value of H would be A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

So, if I can compute each <Si·Sj>, I can add them up and multiply by A to get the expectation value.

Given that, let me compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

Recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<S1·S2 + S2·S1>) = (1/2)(2 <S1z S2z + (S1x S2x + S1y S2y)).

But wait, actually, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2.

So, perhaps using that identity is better.

Wait, yes, for any two operators A and B, we have A·B = (1/2)(A + B)^2 - (A^2 + B^2)/2.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2)<S1 + S2)^2 - (1/2)(<S1^2> + <S2^2>).

But since each S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, we have:

<S1·S2> = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (1/2)(3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2) = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4 ħ^2).

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so substituting back, we have a circular argument.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute <S1·S2> directly.

Wait, another approach: for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators have expectation values. For a given state, the expectation value of S1z is the probability of spin-up minus probability of spin-down, multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, the expectation value of S1x and S1y can be computed, but they are a bit trickier because they involve transitions between spin-up and spin-down.

But since our state psi is a combination of different terms, maybe it's better to compute the expectation values directly by expanding the state.

But that might be time-consuming, but let's try.

First, let's note that the state psi is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). So, it's a symmetric combination where each term has exactly two up spins and one down spin.

To compute <S1·S2>, I can write it as (1/4)(S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z). Then, the expectation value would involve the expectation of each component.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write S1·S2 in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Recall that for spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. Therefore, S1·S2 = (ħ^2/4) (σ1 · σ2).

So, <S1·S2> = (ħ^2/4) <σ1 · σ2>.

And since σ1 · σ2 = 2 S1·S2 / ħ^2, but wait, that's going back. Alternatively, σ1 · σ2 = 2 S1·S2 / (ħ^2/4). Wait, no, better to compute <σ1 · σ2>.

Wait, if I write S1·S2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ1 · σ2), so σ1 · σ2 = (4 S1·S2)/(ħ^2). Therefore, <σ1 · σ2> = (4/ħ^2) <S1·S2>.

But perhaps I can compute <σ1 · σ2> for the state psi.

So, let me note that σi are the Pauli matrices for each spin.

For spin 1, σ1 acts on the first particle, σ2 on the second, etc.

So, let's write the state psi in terms of tensor products of spin states.

Let me denote |↑> = [1; 0], |↓> = [0; 1], but since we have three particles, each spin state is a two-dimensional vector. So, the state psi can be written as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ]

Where ↑ and ↓ are 2x2 vectors for each spin.

So, to compute <σ1 · σ2>, I need to compute the expectation value of σ1 · σ2 in the state psi.

But σ1 · σ2 is a tensor product operator acting on the first and second spins, and the third spin is unaffected. So, when calculating <psi| σ1 · σ2 |psi>, it can be broken down into parts where the first two spins are acted upon, and the third spin is independent.

Wait, no, because the state psi is entangled across all three spins, so I might need to compute the expectation value by considering all possible overlapping terms.

But perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to note that the spin state psi is symmetric, so the expectation value of any symmetric function of the spins will be easier to compute.

Wait, another approach: for each pair (i,j), the expectation value <S_i · S_j> can be computed using the formula:

<S_i · S_j> = (1/2) [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> ]

Since S_i and S_j are spin-1/2 particles, <S_i^2> = (3/4) ħ^2.

So, for each pair (i,j), <S_i · S_j> = (1/2) [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - (3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2) ]

But (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i · S_j, so substituting, we have:

<S_i · S_j> = (1/2) [ <S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i · S_j> - (3/4 ħ^2 + 3/4 ħ^2) ]

But this seems circular because S_i · S_j appears on both sides.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the formula I have is:

<S_i · S_j> = [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> ] / 2

So, <(S_i + S_j)^2> = <S_i^2> + <S_j^2> + 2 <S_i · S_j>

So, rearranged, <S_i · S_j> = [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> ] / 2

Hence, using that, I can compute <S_i · S_j> if I can compute <(S_i + S_j)^2>.

But S_i + S_j is the total spin operator for particles i and j, and (S_i + S_j)^2 is the Casimir operator for the combined system of particles i and j.

So, for two spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 1 (triplet) and 0 (singlet). So, the eigenvalues of (S_i + S_j)^2 are 2ħ^2 (for S=1) and 0 (for S=0).

Therefore, if I can find the probability of the pair (i,j) being in a triplet state or a singlet state, I can compute <(S_i + S_j)^2> as (2ħ^2) * P(triplet) + (0) * P(singlet).

So, to compute <(S_i + S_j)^2>, I can find the probability that particles i and j are in a triplet state.

Wait, for the state psi, which is symmetric in all three particles, but how does it look for the first two particles?

Wait, let me write psi as (|↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>)/sqrt(3).

So, if I consider only the first two particles, the state is a mixture of |↑↑>, |↑↓>, and |↓↑>, each appearing once.

Each of these is a term in the state.

But wait, in the entire state, each particle is in a superposition, so it's not straightforward to compute the expectation value.

Wait, but given that the state is symmetric, perhaps the pair (1,2) is in a symmetric state as well.

Wait, let me compute the reduced density matrix for particles 1 and 2, obtained by tracing out particle 3.

But since psi is a symmetric combination, maybe the reduced state is symmetric as well.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value <S1 · S2> directly.

So, <S1 · S2> = (ħ^2/4) <σ1 · σ2>

And <σ1 · σ2> = Tr(ρ σ1 σ2), where ρ is the density matrix of the state.

Since the state is psi, the density matrix is |psi><psi|.

So, <σ1 · σ2> = Tr(|psi><psi| σ1 σ2).

But this Tr can be computed as sum_{a,b,c} <a|psi><psi|b><b|σ1 σ2|c><c|a>.

Wait, maybe it's too involved, but let's try.

First, let me note that σ1 and σ2 act on different particles, so when multiplying σ1 σ2, it's a tensor product operator acting on particles 1 and 2.

So, when computing <psi| σ1 σ2 |psi>, we can think of it as the sum over all possible basis states for particles 1,2,3, of the coefficients in psi, multiplied by the corresponding sigma products.

Alternatively, perhaps an easier way is to compute the expectation value <σ1 · σ2> by considering the individual terms.

Wait, another approach: since the state psi is symmetric, the expectation value of any symmetric spin operator can be computed by considering the symmetric nature.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps note that the expectation value of S1 · S2 can be found by considering the probabilities of the different spin configurations.

Given that the state psi is in a superposition of three states where each state has two up spins and one down spin. So, in each term, the first two spins can be both up, up and down, or down and up.

So, for each term, let's compute the value of S1 · S2.

First, for the term |↑↑↓>:

S1·S2 = (ħ^2/4)(|↑> <↑| + |↓> <↓|) (same for S2?)

Wait, no, S1·S2 is (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z). So, for |↑↑↓>, S1z = +ħ/2, S2z = +ħ/2, so S1z S2z = (ħ/2)^2.

For S1x S2x, since Sx is (ħ/2)(|↑><↓| + |↓><↑|), so S1x S2x acting on |↑↑↓> gives (ħ/2)^2 (|↑><↓| + |↓><↑|) |↑> |↑> = (ħ/2)^2 (|↑><↓| |↑> + |↓><↑| |↑>).

But wait, perhaps another way: the expectation value of S1x S2x in |↑↑↓> is (ħ/2)^2 times the probability of being in a state where spins are opposite, which in this case, |↑↑> is both up, so S1x S2x would have an expectation value of 0, because |↑><↓| acting on |↑> would give zero, similarly for |↓><↑| acting on |↑>.

Wait, actually, more accurately, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state |↑↑> is (ħ^2/4)(1 + 0 + 0) = (ħ^2/4)*(1), because S1z S2z = (ħ/2)^2, and S1x S2x and S1y S2y have zero expectation because the spins are aligned.

Similarly, for the term |↑↓↑>, the expectation value of S1·S2 would be (ħ^2/4)*( (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) )? Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the expectation value in each term and then average.

So, in each term of psi, we have three different states: |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, and |↓↑↑>. Each term is orthogonal, so the expectation value is the average of the expectation values in each term.

Therefore, <psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3) [<↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓> + <↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> + <↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑>].

So, let's compute each of these.

First term: <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓>

As I thought earlier, S1·S2 = (ħ^2/4)(σ1·σ2). In the state |↑↑↓>, σ1·σ2 = |↑><↑| + |↓><↓| + 2 Re(|↑><↓| + |↓><↑|). Wait, no, σ1·σ2 is equal to 2|↑><↑| + 2|↓><↓| -1, because σ1·σ2 = 2 I - 2 |↑><↑| - 2 |↓><↓|, but wait, actually, σ1·σ2 = 2 S1·S2 / (ħ^2/4). Wait, no, let's recall:

Wait, S1·S2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ1·σ2). So, σ1·σ2 = 4 S1·S2 / ħ^2. But I might have confused that earlier.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = (ħ/2)^2 (σ1 · σ2). Therefore, σ1 · σ2 = 4 S1·S2 / ħ^2.

But regardless, let's compute σ1 · σ2 for the state |↑↑↓>.

The state |↑↑↓> is |↑> ⊗ |↑> ⊗ |↓>.

So, σ1·σ2 is a product of σ1 and σ2 acting on the first two spins. So, when acting on |↑↑↓>, σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓> = (σ1 ⊗ σ2) |↑↑> ⊗ |↓>.

Compute (σ1 ⊗ σ2) |↑↑>:

σ1 |↑> = i|↓>, and σ2 |↑> = i|↓>. Therefore,

σ1 ⊗ σ2 |↑↑> = (i|↓>) ⊗ (i|↓>) = (i^2)|↓↓> = (-1)|↓↓>.

Therefore, σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓> = (-1)|↓↓> ⊗ |↓> = -|↓↓↓>.

So, <↑↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓> = <↑↑↓| (-1)|↓↓↓> = - <↑↑↓| ↓↓↓> = 0, because |↑↑↓> and |↓↓↓> are orthogonal.

Wait, that seems strange. So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in |↑↑↓> is zero? But that contradicts with my previous thought that it should be positive because both spins are up.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute σ1·σ2 again.

σ1·σ2 = σ1x σ2x + σ1y σ2y + σ1z σ2z.

So, let's compute each term.

First, σ1z σ2z |↑↑> = (1)(1)|↑↑> = |↑↑>.

σ1x σ2x |↑↑> = (i|↓>)(i|↓>) = (i^2)|↓↓> = (-1)|↓↓>.

Similarly, σ1y σ2y |↑↑> = (i|↓>)(-i|↓>) = (-i^2)|↓↓> = (1)|↓↓>.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = (-1)|↓↓> + |↓↓> = 0.

Wait, so σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = 0? That can't be.

Wait, no, wait, hold on: σ1x σ2x |↑↑> = (-1)|↓↓>, as σ1x |↑> = |↓>, and σ2x |↑> = |↓>, so product is |↓↓>, multiplied by (i)(i) = -1.

Similarly, σ1y σ2y |↑↑> = (σ1y |↑>)(σ2y |↑>) = (-i|↓>)(-i|↓>) = (-i)^2 |↓↓> = (-1) |↓↓>.

Wait, hold on, let me recall:

σx |↑> = |↓>, σx |↓> = |↑>.

σy |↑> = -i|↓>, σy |↓> = i|↑>.

So, σ1y σ2y |↑↑> = (-i|↓>) ⊗ (i|↑>) = (-i)(i)|↓↓> = (-i^2)|↓↓> = (1)|↓↓>.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with the previous step.

Wait, let me do it carefully.

σ1y |↑> = -i|↓>, σ2y |↑> = -i|↓>.

Therefore, σ1y σ2y |↑↑> = (-i|↓>) ⊗ (-i|↓>) = (-i)^2 |↓↓> = (-1)|↓↓>.

Similarly, σ1x σ2x |↑↑> = (i|↓>) ⊗ (i|↓>) = (i^2)|↓↓> = (-1)|↓↓>.

So, putting it together:

σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = σ1x σ2x |↑↑> + σ1y σ2y |↑↑> + σ1z σ2z |↑↑>

= (-1)|↓↓> + (-1)|↓↓> + (1)|↑↑>

= (-2)|↓↓> + |↑↑>

So, <↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = <↑↑| (-2)|↓↓> + |↑↑> = 0 + 1 = 1.

Wait, but that's not correct because in the state |↑↑>, σ1·σ2 should be 1 because S1z S2z is 1 and the others might average to zero? Wait, but in reality, S1·S2 is (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z).

Wait, for two spin-up particles:

S1z S2z = (ħ/2)^2.

S1x S2x and S1y S2y, when acting on |↑↑>, give (ħ/2)^2 (|↓↓> + |↑↑>), but when you take expectation value in |↑↑>, only the |↑↑> term contributes.

Wait, let me think in terms of expectation values.

Wait, for a state |↑↑>, the expectation value of S1x S2x is <↑| S1x |↑> <↑| S2x |↑> = 0 * 0 = 0, similarly for S1y S2y. So, <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑> = <↑↑| S1z S2z |↑↑> = (ħ/2)^2.

But according to the earlier calculation, σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = (-2)|↓↓> + |↑↑>, which when taking inner product with <↑↑| gives 1. So, seems like <σ1·σ2> is 1 in |↑↑>.

But in that case, S1·S2 = (ħ^2/4)(σ1·σ2). So, in the state |↑↑>, <S1·S2> = (ħ^2/4)*1.

But wait, this seems contradictory because for two spin-up particles, I thought that S1·S2 would be (ħ^2/4)*(1 + 0 + 0) = ħ^2/4.

But according to the calculation, it is indeed ħ^2/4, which seems correct.

Wait, but then when we computed σ1·σ2 |↑↑> = (-2)|↓↓> + |↑↑>, so in the outer product, the diagonal term is 1, and the off-diagonal terms are -2.

Therefore, when you have a state like |↑↑↓>, which is |↑↑> ⊗ |↓>, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is the same as in |↑↑>, because the third spin is not involved in σ1·σ2.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we have |↑↑↓>, and we apply σ1·σ2, it's acting only on the first two spins, and the third spin is left as is.

Wait, so in |↑↑↓>, the first two spins are |↑↑>, and the third is |↓>. So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is the same as in |↑↑>, which is 1.

Wait, hold on, no. Because when we have a product state, the expectation value factorizes. So, in |↑↑↓>, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is the same as in |↑↑> times |↓>, which is just the expectation value in |↑↑>.

So, <↑↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↑↓> = <↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑> * <↓| ↓> = 1 * 1 = 1.

Similarly, in the state |↑↓↑>, the first two spins are |↑↓>, so the expectation value of σ1·σ2 is <↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓>.

Compute that: <↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓>.

Again, let's compute σ1·σ2 |↑↓>:

σ1z σ2z |↑↓> = (1)(-1)|↑↓> = -|↑↓>.

σ1x σ2x |↑↓> = (i|↓>)(i|↑>) = (i^2)|↓↑> = (-1)|↓↑>.

σ1y σ2y |↑↓> = (-i|↓>)(-i|↑>) = (-i)^2 |↓↑> = (-1)|↓↑
