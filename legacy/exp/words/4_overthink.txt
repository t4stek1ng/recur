Okay, so I have this problem about a nurses’ station ordering bandages. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many bandages they started with on the first day, and apparently, the correct answer is 38. But I want to understand why that is.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

"A nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?"

Hmm, okay. So, they order bandages in packs of 50. That means each time they order, they get 50 bandages. But each day, they might use some and have to order more if they run out.

Let me try to model each day step by step.

Let’s denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as \( x \). So, \( x \) is the initial number we need to find.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- So, at the end of the first day, they have \( x - 38 \) bandages left.
- Since they used 38, which is less than 50, they must have had enough bandages to not need a new pack. Therefore, they ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages) during the day. So, they end up with \( (x - 38) + 50 \) bandages at the end of day one.

Wait, hold on. Is the ordering done before using or after using? The wording says, "On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages." So, they used 38, then ordered one pack. So, at the end of day one, they have 38 used, and then they added 50 from the new pack. So, total bandages after day one: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \).

Wait, so if they started with x, used 38, and then ordered 50, so total is x - 38 + 50, which is x + 12.

But does this make sense? So, if they started with x, used 38, so they had x - 38 left, and then they ordered 50, so they have x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 at the end of the first day.

Okay, moving on to the second day.

**Second Day:**
- They used ten fewer bandages than the first day. So, on the first day, they used 38, so on the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- How many bandages did they have at the start of the second day? That would be the end of the first day: x + 12.
- So, they used 28, so they have x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left at the end of the second day.
- Now, we don't know if they ordered more bandages on the second day. The problem says on the second day, they used ten fewer bandages, but doesn't mention ordering. So, do they have enough bandages to last the day without ordering? Let's see, they used 28, so if they had at least 28, they might not need to order.

Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't specify if they ordered on the second day. Let me check again. It only mentions that on the first day, they used 38 and ordered one pack. On the second day, it just says they used ten fewer bandages. So maybe they had to order more bandages on the second day.

But wait, let me think. If they had x + 12 at the end of the first day, and they used 28 on the second day, so they have x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 left.

If x - 16 is negative, that doesn't make sense, so x must be at least 16. But if x - 16 is positive, then they have that many left, but since 28 is less than 50, maybe they didn't need to order another pack.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say they ordered on the second day. It only mentions ordering on the first and third days. Hmm, so perhaps on the second day, they didn't need to order, and they just used 28 from the previous stock.

So, moving on to the third day.

**Third Day:**
- They used half a pack, so half of 50 is 25 bandages.
- Also, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages on the third day. So, they added 2 * 50 = 100 bandages on that day.
- So, at the start of the third day, they had x - 16 bandages left from the second day.
- They used 25 bandages, so they have x - 16 - 25 = x - 41 bandages left.
- Then they ordered 100 bandages, so they have x - 41 + 100 = x + 59 bandages at the end of the third day.

But the problem says they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, x + 59 = 78. Then, solving for x:

x + 59 = 78

x = 78 - 59

x = 19.

Wait, but that can't be right because 19 is less than the number they used on the first day, which was 38. So, starting with 19, using 38 on the first day is impossible because they don't have enough. So, something's wrong here.

Let me go back and check my steps.

**First Day:**
Used 38, ordered 1 pack (50), so ended with x - 38 + 50 = x + 12. That seems fine.

**Second Day:**
Used 28, ended with x + 12 - 28 = x - 16. So, they have x - 16 left.

**Third Day:**
Used half a pack, which is 25, and ordered two packs, which is 100.

So, starting with x - 16, using 25, so have x - 16 -25 = x - 41 left.

Then, adding 100, so x - 41 + 100 = x + 59.

And the problem says they have 78 left, so x + 59 = 78, so x = 19.

But 19 is less than 38, which is impossible because they used 38 on the first day. So, must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe my interpretation of when they order is wrong.

Is the ordering done at the beginning or the end of the day?

If they use bandages during the day, and then at the end, they order more if needed.

But the problem says on the first day, they used 38 and ordered one pack.

So, perhaps the order is done after using the bandages.

So, on the first day: Start with x.

Use 38, so left with x - 38.

Since x - 38 is less than 50, they order one pack, so they have x -38 + 50 = x + 12.

Similarly, on the second day: they start with x + 12.

Use 28, so left with x + 12 - 28 = x - 16.

Since 28 is less than 50, they don't need to order another pack. So, they just have x -16 at the end of the day.

Third day: they start with x -16.

They used 25 (half a pack), so left with x -16 -25 = x -41.

Since they ordered two packs, 100, so they have x -41 + 100 = x + 59 left.

So, they have 78 left: x +59 =78 => x=19.

But again, this is a problem because starting with 19, on the first day, they used 38, which is impossible.

Hence, my initial model must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps when they order at the end of the day, the next day they have the new stock. So, perhaps I need to model the stock correctly.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by tracking the stock each day.

Let me define:

Let S0 be the stock at the beginning of day 1.

They use 38 on day 1, so after use, they have S0 -38.

Then, they order 50, so stock becomes S0 -38 +50 = S0 +12.

So, stock at end of day 1: S0 +12.

Day 2:

They use 28 bandages (10 fewer than 38), so stock becomes S0 +12 -28 = S0 -16.

They don't need to order more because 28 < 50, so they have S0 -16 at the end of day 2.

Day 3:

They use half a pack, which is 25, so stock becomes S0 -16 -25 = S0 -41.

They order two packs, so 100, so stock becomes S0 -41 +100 = S0 +59.

At end of day 3, stock is S0 +59, which is given as 78.

So, S0 +59 =78 => S0=19.

But as before, starting with 19, first day they use 38, which is impossible.

Therefore, my model is inconsistent.

Wait, another thought. Maybe when they order, they don't add the bandages unless needed. So, perhaps on the first day, they used 38, which is below 50, so they have 50 -38=12 left in the pack, plus the remaining stock. Wait, no, that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps they order a pack each day before using the bandages, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages."

Hmm, so they used 38, then ordered one. So, perhaps after using 38, they realized they needed more, so they ordered one.

Similarly, on the third day, they used half a pack, which is 25, so they had 25 used, and then they ordered two packs.

So, perhaps the process is:

Each day, they use a certain number of bandages, then if they don't have enough left, they order more to cover the next day.

But the problem is, the problem statement doesn't specify whether the ordering is before or after using.

But since on the first day, they used 38 and then ordered one, that suggests that after using 38, they ordered one.

Similarly, on the third day, they used half a pack (25) and then ordered two packs. So, process is: use some, then order if needed.

So, if this is the case, then the stock after usage is (current stock - used) + ordered.

So, let's try modeling this.

Let S0 be the initial stock.

Day 1:

Used: 38

So, stock after use: S0 -38

Then, ordered: 50

So, stock at end of day 1: S0 -38 +50 = S0 +12

Day 2:

Used: 38 -10=28

Stock after use: (S0 +12) -28= S0 -16

Then, ordered: ?

If after using 28, do they need to order? The problem doesn't say they did on day 2. It only says on day 1 and day 3.

So, maybe on day 2, they didn't order any more because 28 is less than 50.

So, stock at end of day 2: S0 -16

Day 3:

Used: half a pack, which is 25.

Stock after use: (S0 -16) -25 = S0 -41

Then, ordered: two packs, 100.

So, stock at end of day 3: S0 -41 +100 = S0 +59

Given that at end of day 3, stock is 78:

S0 +59=78 => S0=19

But again, starting with 19, day 1 they used 38, which is impossible.

Therefore, there must be a flaw in the model.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ordering is done at the beginning of the day, not after using.

So, let me try that.

Day 1:

Start with S0.

Order 50 at the beginning.

Used 38, so left with 50 -38=12.

So, stock at end of day1: 12.

But problem says they ordered one bulk pack on day 1, and used 38, so maybe their initial stock was 38, but then they ordered 50 to have more.

Wait, maybe it's the other way: On day1, they ordered one pack, so they have 50.

They used 38, so left with 12. So, starting on day2, they have 12.

But the problem says on the second day, they used ten fewer, so 38 -10=28.

But if they only had 12 at the start of day2, they can't use 28. So, that can't be.

Hmm, conflicting interpretations.

Wait, perhaps the key is that after day1, they have some in stock, and they can order more as needed.

Wait, maybe the ordering is based on the number needed for the next day.

But the problem isn't explicit about that.

Alternatively, perhaps all ordering is done upfront.

Wait, maybe the first day, they start with some stock, use 38, then since they need to have enough for the next day, which is 28, they order enough to cover the next day's usage.

So, they used 38 on day1, so they need 28 on day2, so in total, they need 38 +28=66 bandages.

Since they order in 50 packs, they need to order two packs (100 bandages) to have enough for the next two days.

But wait, the problem says they ordered one pack on day1. So, maybe not.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up equations.

Let me try to define variables.

Let’s let S0 be the initial stock.

On day1:

- Start with S0.

- Used 38, so have S0 -38 left.

- Then, they ordered 50, so total at end of day1: S0 -38 +50= S0 +12.

On day2:

- Start with S0 +12.

- Used 28, so have S0 +12 -28= S0 -16.

- Since 28 is less than 50, perhaps they didn't order. So, stock at end of day2: S0 -16.

On day3:

- Start with S0 -16.

- Used 25, so have S0 -16 -25= S0 -41.

- Then, they ordered two packs (100), so at end of day3: S0 -41 +100= S0 +59.

Given that at end of day3, stock is 78:

S0 +59=78 => S0=19.

But again, this is a problem because S0=19, which is less than 38 used on day1.

So, this suggests a contradiction.

This must mean that my interpretation is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe they order bandages at the beginning of the day, not after using.

So, let's try:

Let’s assume they order at the beginning of the day.

So, on day1:

- Order 50.

- Start day1 with 50.

- Used 38, so left with 12.

At end of day1, they have 12.

But problem states that on day2, they used ten fewer, which would be 28.

But if they have only 12 left at end of day1, they can't use 28 on day2.

Thus, that contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the ordering is done at the end of the day.

Wait, perhaps the initial stock is more than 38, but with my equations, it's not adding up.

Wait, another thought: The problem says they "had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day." Maybe that's the total, including unused portions of the packs.

But in my model, I assumed that when they order a pack, they get 50, regardless of how much they use. So, if they use half a pack, 25, and then order two packs, so they have 25 + 100=125.

But in the problem, they only have 78 left. So, perhaps the 78 includes the leftovers from previous packs.

Wait, maybe each time they order a pack, they only get 50 if they order one, but if they order two, they get two full packs, 100.

But the leftover isn't cumulative. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the 78 bandages at the end of day3 includes the leftovers from day1 and day2.

Wait, but in the model, the stock is 78 at the end of day3, so that includes all the unused bandages from all days.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when they order, they can have leftover bandages from previous orders.

But I need to think about it differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the stock as the total bandages at each day, including any leftover from previous orders.

Wait, let's try this:

Let’s say that each time they order, they get 50, but if they have leftover from previous orders, they can use that.

So, let me try step by step.

Let’s denote:

Start with S0 bandages.

**Day1:**
- They use 38, so left with S0 -38.
- Then, they order 50, so they now have (S0 -38) +50= S0 +12.

But they also have 50 bandages from the order, but they used 38 on that day.

Wait, maybe I need to model the stock as a combination of ordered and unused.

Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler. The stock is either the bandages they have in the station or the bandages they have on hand.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous in wording.

Alternatively, think of it as:

Each day, they use a certain number of bandages, and order more if needed, such that they don't run out.

So, on day1:

Start with S0.

Use 38, so they have S0 -38 left.

They need to make sure they have enough for the next day.

But the problem doesn't specify that they order for the next day, only that on the third day, they ordered two packs.

Wait, perhaps the key is that they have to have enough bandages to cover their usage each day, so they order the necessary packs each day.

But the problem doesn't explicitly say that they order every day, only on the first and third days.

So, perhaps my initial model is correct, but then the fact that starting with 19 is impossible suggests that maybe the initial stock is higher, and I'm misapplying the usage.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that on the first day, they start with S0, use 38, and then since they need to cover future days, they order 50.

On the second day, they start with S0 +12 (from day1), use 28, and don't need to order because 28 is less than 50. So, they have S0 +12 -28= S0 -16.

On the third day, they have S0 -16, use 25, and then order two packs (100) because they need to cover not only the current day but future days.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that they are trying to cover future days, just that on the third day, they used half a pack and ordered two bulk packs.

So, maybe on the third day, they didn't need to order because 25 is less than 50, but they chose to order two packs regardless.

But that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps when they ordered on day1, it was for day2. So, on day1, they used 38, then ordered one pack (50) to have enough for day2.

But day2 they used 28, so they still have some left.

Then, on day3, they used 25, and ordered two packs (100) because they wanted to have enough for the next days.

But the problem says at the end of day3, they had 78 bandages left.

So, if they ordered two packs on day3, which is 100, and used 25, so they have 100 -25=75.

Plus, from day2, they had some left over.

Wait, let me try this.

**Day1:**
Start with S0.

Used 38, have S0 -38 left.

Ordered 50, so total bandages: S0 -38 +50 = S0 +12.

**Day2:**
Started with S0 +12.

Used 28, have S0 +12 -28 = S0 -16 left.

Since 28 <50, they don't need to order.

**Day3:**
Started with S0 -16.

Used 25, have S0 -16 -25= S0 -41 left.

Ordered two packs (100), so total bandages: S0 -41 +100= S0 +59.

Given that at end of day3, they have 78.

So, S0 +59=78 => S0=19.

But again, S0=19, which is less than 38.

Thus, impossible.

Wait, so perhaps my assumption that they only need to order when they don't have enough for the next day is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the order on day1 was not just for day2, but for day1 and day2.

Meaning, on day1, they used 38, and then ordered 50 to cover day1 and day2.

But on day2, they used 28, so from the 50, they used 38 on day1, and 28 on day2, so total 66, leaving 50-66= -16, which is not possible.

Wait, another angle: Maybe they have cumulative usage.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the initial stock is 38, but they ordered 50 on day1, so total 38+50=88, but that seems not.

Wait, perhaps when they order, they get 50, regardless of usage.

Wait, let me try this:

Suppose that the initial stock is S0.

**Day1:**
Used 38, so have S0 -38.

They then order 50, so they have S0 -38 +50= S0 +12.

But during day1, they used 38, so they used 38 out of their initial S0, then added 50.

So, at the end of day1, they have S0 +12.

**Day2:**
Used 28, so have S0 +12 -28= S0 -16.

They don't need to order because 28 <50, so they have S0 -16 at the end.

**Day3:**
Used 25, so have S0 -16 -25= S0 -41.

Ordered two packs, 100, so have S0 -41 +100= S0 +59.

End of day3: S0 +59=78 => S0=19.

Same result.

Therefore, starting with 19 is impossible because day1 requires 38.

Therefore, my model is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the key is that on day3, they used half a pack, meaning they had a partial pack.

So, perhaps they had a partial pack, and when they ordered two packs, it's 100, regardless of the partial.

But the problem says they had 78 bandages left, which is an exact number, 78, so 78 is a multiple of... 78 is 50 + 28, but not necessarily.

Wait, maybe they had 78 left, which includes some partial packs.

Wait, another angle: Let's think that the ordering is done at the beginning of the day.

So, day1:

Start with S0.

Order 50, so have 50.

Use 38, so left with 12.

End of day1:12.

Day2:

Start with 12.

They need to use 28. But they only have 12, so they need to order more.

So, they need 28 -12=16 more. So, they order 50, which is more than needed.

Wait, but the problem says on day2, they used ten fewer, so 38-10=28.

So, they used 28 on day2.

But they started with 12 from day1, and 12 <28, so they must have ordered more.

So, they have 12 at the end of day1, then on day2, they start with 12.

They need to use 28, so they have to order 16 more, but since they order in packs of 50, they have to order one pack.

So, they have 12 +50=62.

They use 28, so left with 62 -28=34.

End of day2:34.

Day3:

Start with 34.

They use half a pack, which is 25, so left with 34 -25=9.

Then, they order two packs, 100, so total at end of day3:9 +100=109.

But problem says they had 78 left at the end of day3.

This contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe they order two packs at the end of day3, which is 100, but used 25, so they have 75.

But they also had 34 from day2, but wait, that's 34 used before.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, let me try this:

If ordering is done at the beginning of the day, then:

**Day1:**
Start with S0.

Order 50.

Use 38, have 12 left.

End of day1:12.

**Day2:**
Start with 12.

Order 50 (since they need to use 28, and have only 12, they need 16 more, so order 50).

Total at start of day2:12 +50=62.

Use 28, left with 62 -28=34.

End of day2:34.

**Day3:**
Start with 34.

Order 100 (two packs).

Use 25, left with 34 -25=9.

End of day3:9 +100=109.

But problem says end with78.

Conflict.

Alternative approach: Maybe they don't order unless they run out.

So, if they have any bandages left, they don't need to order.

So, day1:

Start with S0.

Use 38, left with S0 -38.

If S0 -38 <0, they need to order, but the problem says on day1, they ordered one pack.

So, they must have S0 -38 >=0, but since they ordered one pack, perhaps regardless.

Wait, perhaps the ordering is based on the next day's usage.

So, on day1, they used 38, and they know they need 28 on day2, so they order 50 to cover day2.

So, after day1, they have 50 -38=12, plus whatever was left.

Wait, but this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the stock is being tracked, and each day, they use a certain number, then order as needed.

So, if they have stock left, they can use it; otherwise, they order.

So:

Let’s define:

Start with S0.

**Day1:**
Used 38. So, if S0 >=38, then have S0 -38 left. If S0 <38, they need to order (50 - (S0 - unused)).

But the problem says on day1, they used 38 and ordered one. So, they must have had S0 >=38, because they didn't need to order before using.

So, they had S0 >=38, used 38, so left with S0 -38.

Then, ordered 50, so total is S0 -38 +50= S0 +12.

**Day2:**
They used 28, so from S0 +12, they subtract 28, so have S0 +12 -28= S0 -16.

If S0 -16 >=0, they have that left.

But the problem says on day2, they used ten fewer, so 28, but doesn't mention ordering.

So, perhaps they didn't need to order.

So, at end of day2, S0 -16.

**Day3:**
Used 25, so from S0 -16, subtract25, so have S0 -16 -25= S0 -41.

Then, they ordered two packs, so add 100.

So, total at end of day3: S0 -41 +100= S0 +59.

Given that they have78 left, so:

S0 +59=78 => S0=19.

Again, same result.

But starting with 19, day1: used38 impossible.

Therefore, the only way for this to make sense is if the initial stock is 38 plus something.

Wait, perhaps the initial stock is 38, and they order one pack on day1, so 38 +50=88.

Then, day2: use28, end with88 -28=60.

Day3: use25, end with60 -25=35. Then, order two packs, 100, so total 35 +100=135. But problem says they have78 left. So, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, initial stock is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The problem says: "On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages."

So, that means that on day1, they had enough to use38, and then they ordered one, so they must have had at least38.

Similarly, on day3, they used half a pack (25) and ordered two.

But regardless, in my model, starting with19 is needed, which is impossible.

Therefore, perhaps the initial model is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 50 is a bulk pack, but they can order multiple packs at once.

Wait, but the problem says "ordered one bulk pack of bandages" on day1.

So, on day1, they ordered one pack (50), used38, so have12 left.

On day2, they used28, so from12, they can't do that. So, they must have had stock from day1 plus day2's order.

Wait, this is too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the first day: they started with S0.

They used38, then ordered one pack, so they have S0 -38 +50= S0 +12.

Second day: they used28, so S0 +12 -28= S0 -16.

Third day: they used25, so S0 -16 -25= S0 -41.

Then, they ordered two packs, so S0 -41 +100= S0 +59.

Given that S0 +59=78, so S0=19.

But again, S0=19 <38, which is invalid.

Therefore, the only conclusion is that the problem is flawed or I'm misapplying.

Wait, but the problem says the correct answer is38, so perhaps my entire model is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the starting stock is38, and they had to order more.

Wait, if they started with38, on day1, they used38, then ordered50, so total is38 +50=88.

Day2: used28, so88 -28=60.

Day3: used25, so60 -25=35.

Ordered two packs, 100, so total35 +100=135.

But problem says ended with78, so not matching.

Alternatively, starting with38, at day3, they have78.

Wait, 78 is the total bandages, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought.

Perhaps the initial stock is38, and they have a reorder system.

Each day, they use a certain number, and if they run out, they order more.

But the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, think of it as the stockpile:

They start with x.

Each day, they use a certain number, and if they need to, order more.

But the problem says on day1, they used38 and ordered1.

So, if they started with x, they used38, so they have x -38.

Then, they ordered1, so x -38 +50= x +12.

On day2, they used28, so x +12 -28= x -16.

If they have x -16 >=0, they don't need to order.

On day3, they used25, so x -16 -25= x -41.

They ordered two, so x -41 +100= x +59.

End with78, so x +59=78 =>x=19.

Again, same result.

But 19 is less than38.

Wait, so perhaps the starting stock is38, but when they used38, they had to order one more to cover the usage.

But this is getting too circular.

Wait, given that the problem says the correct answer is38, but when I try modeling, I can't get it.

Thus, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose that the initial stock is38.

On day1: used38, so have0 left. Then, ordered50, so at end of day1:50.

Day2: used28, so have50 -28=22.

Day3: used25, so have22 -25= -3. Wait, that can't be.

So, negative, so they need to order.

But the problem says they ordered two packs on day3, so +100.

Thus, at end of day3: -3 +100=97.

But problem says78. So, not matching.

Alternatively, starting with38, day1: used38, ordered50, so end with50.

Day2: used28, end with22.

Day3: used25, end with-3. So, negative, need to order, but the problem says they ordered two, so +100, so 97.

Not78.

Wait, if they used25 on day3, they might have had some stock left.

Wait, maybe they had some leftover from previous days.

Wait, if on day3, they had, say,12 left from day1, and on day2, they had22, and on day3, they used25, starting from12 +22=34.

Wait, 34 -25=9, then ordered100, so total109. Again, not78.

This is really confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the initial stock is78, but that is the end.

Wait, no, problem says at end of day3, they had78.

Perhaps, let's think in reverse.

At the end of day3, they have78.

On day3, they used25, then ordered two packs.

So, at the start of day3, they had78 -25=53.

Wait, but they ordered two packs on day3, so before using, they had to have stock plus what they ordered.

Wait, no, reverse.

Wait, if on day3, they ended with78, which is after using25 and ordering two packs.

So, before using, they had78 +25=103.

And they had103 at start of day3, which was after day2.

So, at end of day2, they had103.

On day2, they used28, so at end of day2, they had103.

Which was after day1.

So, on day1, they ended with103 -28=75.

On day1, they used38 and ordered one pack.

So, at start of day1, they had75.

Then, used38, so75 -38=37.

Then, ordered50, so37 +50=87.

Wait, but we have a contradiction.

Wait, no, reverse.

Wait, let me think:

End of day3:78.

Before using on day3, they had78 +25=103.

At the start of day3, they had103.

Which was after day2's usage.

On day2, they used28, so at end of day2, they had103 -28=75.

On day1, they ended with75.

On day1, they used38, so at end of day1,75 -38=37.

Then, they ordered50, so37 +50=87.

But at the beginning of day1, they started with87.

But the problem doesn't say anything about the initial stock, so maybe that's not the way.

Wait, alternatively, think of the stock as:

End of day3:78.

On day3, they used25 and ordered two packs.

So, before using on day3, they had78 +25=103.

That 103 was after day2.

So, on day2, they used28, so at end of day2, they had103 -28=75.
