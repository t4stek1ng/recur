Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of an MA process. The question is asking about the roots of the MA process given by the equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

And the options are:
A. 1 and 2
B. 1 and 0.5
C. 2 and -0.5
D. 1 and -3

The correct answer is supposed to be C. 2 and -0.5, but I need to figure out why that's the case. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for Moving Average (MA) processes, the characteristic roots are found by setting up the characteristic equation derived from the MA polynomial. In general, an MA(q) process can be written as:

\( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

So, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z - \theta_2 z^2 - \dots - \theta_q z^q = 0 \)

In the given equation, I notice that the coefficients are not in the standard order. Let me rewrite the given equation to match the MA(q) form.

The given process is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me rearrange the terms by the lag of u:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, comparing this with the standard MA(q) form:

\( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

Here, the coefficients are:
- \( \theta_0 = 1 \) (coefficient of \( u_t \))
- \( \theta_1 = -3 \) (coefficient of \( u_{t-1} \))
- \( \theta_2 = 1 \) (coefficient of \( u_{t-2} \))

So, it's an MA(2) process because the highest lag is 2.

Now, the characteristic equation for this MA(2) process is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z - \theta_2 z^2 = 0 \)

Plugging in the values:

\( 1 - (-3)z - (1)z^2 = 0 \)

Simplify that:

\( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \)

Wait, let me write that correctly:

The standard form is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z - \theta_2 z^2 = 0 \)

So, substituting:

\( 1 - (-3)z - (1)z^2 = 0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \)

Let me rearrange the terms to make it a standard quadratic equation:

\( -z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

\( z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation is:

\( z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \)

Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation to find the roots. Let me use the quadratic formula:

For an equation \( az^2 + bz + c = 0 \), the roots are:

\( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -1 \).

Plugging into the formula:

\( z = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \)

Simplify:

\( z = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}}{2} \)

Because \( (-3)^2 = 9 \) and \( -4ac = -4(1)(-1) = 4 \).

So, inside the square root: \( 9 + 4 = 13 \)

Hence,

\( z = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2} \)

Hmm, so the roots are \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \) and \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \).

Still, so the roots are \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \) and \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \).

Thus, so the roots are \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \) and \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \).
