<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Consider a system of 3 spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian, H, given by A*(S1*S2+S1*S3+S2*S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators of particle i. The spin-state can be represented by psi=1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3+up1*down2*up3+down1*up2*up3), where upi and downi represent the spin-up and spin-down state of particle i. Is this state an eigenfunction of H? If it is, what is its energy? If it is not, what is the expectation value of E?
Why the correct answer is It is not an eigenstate of H, with expectation value 2/3*A*hbar^2?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state is given as ψ = (1/√3)(|↑1↑2↓3 + |↑1↓2↑3 + |↓1↑2↑3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value. The answer is given as not an eigenstate with expectation value (2/3)Aħ², but I need to understand why.

First, I should recall that for spin systems, the dot product of two spin operators can be expressed using the total spin operator. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i+j}² - S_i² - S_j²). Since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i² = (3/4)ħ² for each i. Also, the total spin S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I can find the value of S² for the state ψ, maybe I can relate it to the expectation value of H.

But wait, H is a sum of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. Let me write that:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

From the total spin formula:

S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, rearranging:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2

Therefore, the expectation value of H would be:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩)/2

I know that each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so the sum ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩ is 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². So, substituting back:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - (9/4)ħ²)/2

So, if I can compute ⟨S²⟩ for the state ψ, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

Now, what is S² for ψ? S² is the square of the total spin operator. The possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. I think ψ is a symmetric state under exchange of particles, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of S².

But let me think about the state ψ. It's a symmetric combination where exactly two spins are up and one is down. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, the total spin projection is 1/2.

Wait let me think about the state ψ. It's a symmetric combination where exactly two spins are up and one is down. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, the total spin projection is 1/2.

Hence let me think about the state ψ. It's a symmetric combination where exactly two spins are up and one is down. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, the total spin projection is 1/2.
