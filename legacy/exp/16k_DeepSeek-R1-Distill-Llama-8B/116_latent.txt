<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Consider a system of 3 spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian, H, given by A*(S1*S2+S1*S3+S2*S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators of particle i. The spin-state can be represented by psi=1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3+up1*down2*up3+down1*up2*up3), where upi and downi represent the spin-up and spin-down state of particle i. Is this state an eigenfunction of H? If it is, what is its energy? If it is not, what is the expectation value of E?
Why the correct answer is It is not an eigenstate of H, with expectation value 3/4*A*hbar^2?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is ψ = 1/√3*(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, find the expectation value of E. The answer is supposedly it's not an eigenstate with an expectation value of (3/4)*A*hbar². Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I recall that for spin systems, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed using the formula S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)² - (1/2)S_i² - (1/2)S_j². So, maybe I can use this identity to rewrite the Hamiltonian in a more manageable form.

But before that, let me note that each S_i is a vector operator with components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. For spin 1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of S_i² are (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², right? So each S_i² has eigenvalue (3/4)ħ².

Wait, but since we're dealing with a system of three particles, maybe I can think about the total spin. Let's define S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, the square of the total spin is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, I get S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That means that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, plugging this into the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ) = (A/2)*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²).

Alright, but since we're dealing with a system of three particles, maybe I need to re-examine whether ψ is indeed an eigenstate can think about the total spin. Let's define S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, the square of the total spin is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, I get S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That means that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, plugging this into the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ) = (A/2)*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²).

Now, but since we're dealing with a system of three particles, maybe I can compute S_total^2 acting on ψ can think about the total spin. Let's define S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, the square of the total spin is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, I get S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That means that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Yes, plugging this into the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ) = (A/2)*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²).
