[overthinking]
But what is Var(ε)? If the original counts y_i follow a Poisson distribution, then Var(y_i) = E[y_i] = λ t_i. But since y_i is the count, then ln(y_i) would have a different variance. Wait, actually, if y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i), then ln(y_i) is not normally distributed, so the ε_i are not normally distributed. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the measurements are counts with some uncertainty, and for the sake of estimation, treat the errors as normally distributed, which might be an approximation.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe instead of using the method of least squares on the counts, we can use the fact that the counts follow a Poisson process, and we can calculate the decay constant λ using the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson counts.

In that case, the maximum likelihood estimator for λ is given by the sum over i of y_i / t_i, where y_i are the counts and t_i are the times. So, that's the estimator.

But then, the variance of this estimator is Var(∑ y_i / t_i) = ∑ Var(y_i / t_i) = ∑ (y_i / t_i^2) * Var(y_i). But since y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i), Var(y_i) = λ t_i. So, Var(∑ y_i / t_i) = ∑ (y_i / t_i^2) * λ t_i = λ ∑ y_i / t_i. Therefore, Var(λ estimator) = λ * E[∑ y_i / t_i] = λ * (∑ y_i / t_i). So, the variance of the estimator is λ times the sum of y_i / t_i.

But wait, that seems a bit circular. Let me think again. The variance of the maximum likelihood estimator for λ is Var(∑ y_i / t_i) = ∑ Var(y_i / t_i). Since y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i), Var(y_i / t_i) = (λ t_i) / t_i^2 = λ / t_i. Therefore, Var(∑ y_i / t_i) = ∑ (λ / t_i) = λ ∑ (1 / t_i). So, the variance is λ times the sum of 1/t_i.

Thus, Var(λ estimator) = λ * ∑ (1 / t_i). But what's the uncertainty in λ? If we have an estimator for λ, say λ_hat = ∑ y_i / t_i, then Var(λ_hat) = λ * ∑ (1 / t_i). So, the standard error is sqrt(λ * ∑ (1 / t_i)).

But we need the uncertainty in λ, not in λ_hat. Wait, perhaps we need to consider the relationship between λ and λ_hat.

Alternatively, if we think that λ_hat is an unbiased estimator for λ, then Var(λ_hat) = Var(λ) = λ * ∑ (1 / t_i). So, if λ_hat is the MLE, then Var(λ_hat) = λ * ∑ (1 / t_i). So, the standard error is sqrt(λ * ∑ (1 / t_i)).

But in any case, we need to relate this to the required uncertainty. The question is about the rate (λ) having an uncertainty of 1%. So, the relative uncertainty in λ should be less than 1%. So, how do we find the number of measurements needed to achieve this?

Wait, but the student is making 10 measurements, so maybe we need to calculate the current uncertainty based on these 10 measurements and then determine how many more measurements are needed to reduce the uncertainty to 1%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the standard error in the decay constant, so that after a certain number of seconds, the standard error is less than 1% of λ.

Wait, the problem is asking "how long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent." So, it's about the number of seconds. Since the student is making 10 one-second measurements, the total time so far is 10 seconds? Or is it 9 seconds? Because the first measurement is at t=0, so maybe the total time is 9 seconds.

Wait, let me parse the question again: "A student makes 10 one-second measurements... How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?" So, is the student making 10 measurements at t=0, t=1, ..., t=9? So, that's 10 measurements over 10 seconds? Or over 9 seconds?

Wait, if they make a measurement every second, starting at t=0, then the number of seconds is the same as the number of measurements minus one. So, 10 measurements would be from t=0 to t=9, which is 9 seconds. So, perhaps the student has measured for 9 seconds so far. Then, how long should they continue counting?

Wait, but the question is about how long to count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1%. So, is it asking about the total time from the start, or the additional time?

Alternatively, maybe the 10 measurements are not the first 10 seconds, but spread over a longer time period. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so it's probably assuming that the student is making 10 one-second measurements consecutively, starting at t=0. So, the total time so far is 10 seconds?

Wait, wait, no. Let's think carefully. If the student makes 10 one-second measurements, starting at t=0, then each subsequent measurement is at t=1, t=2, ..., t=9. So, the total time is 10 seconds? No, because the first measurement is at t=0, so the time interval is from t=0 to t=9, which is 9 seconds. So, the student has already measured for 9 seconds, getting 10 data points.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:

If the student starts counting at t=0, and makes a measurement every second, then the first measurement is at t=0, which is the count at time 0. Then the next measurement is at t=1, which is the count after 1 second. So, the total time is 10 seconds, including the initial measurement at t=0.

But in radioactive decay, the decay process continues, so the count at t=0 is typically the initial number minus any decays that occurred in the first second. Wait, but if we're measuring each second, then each measurement is the count during that second. So, with 10 measurements, the times are t=0,1,2,...,9, covering 10 seconds.

So, the student has already made 10 measurements, over 10 seconds, and now wants to know how long to count further to get an uncertainty of 1% in the decay rate.

So, it's about the number of additional seconds needed beyond the initial 10 seconds. Or is it including the initial 10 seconds? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, 160 seconds, which is 16 seconds beyond 10, but 80 is less, 2000, 5000.

Wait, I think the key is that the student has 10 measurements and wants to know how many more to take, but the way the question is phrased is "how long should the student count"—so total time.

Wait, perhaps it's about the time needed to have a certain number of measurements to estimate λ with 1% uncertainty. So, perhaps it's a question of how many total measurements (i.e., seconds) are needed. But in any case, I need to find a way to relate the number of measurements to the uncertainty in λ.

Since I'm a bit stuck, maybe I should look for a standard method. In nuclear physics, when measuring radioactive decay, a common method is to fit the data using the least squares method and then calculate the uncertainty in λ.

Alternatively, another approach is to model the decay as a linear function on a semi-log scale and then calculate the slope, which is -λ. The uncertainty in λ would then relate to the scatter in the data points.

But since the counts can be considered as Poisson variables, the variance for each count is equal to the mean, which is λ t_i. So, for each time t_i, the variance is λ t_i.

Therefore, the overall variance of the sum of counts would be related to λ and the sum of t_i.

But wait, if we model it as a linear regression on the log scale, the variance of the slope (which is -λ) can be found using the formula I mentioned earlier: Var(λ) = Var(ε) / [sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2 / n].

But since ε_i are the errors in the log scale, which might not be normally distributed, but we can still use this formula as an approximation.

So, let's try to compute sum(t_i^2) and sum(t_i). The times are t=0,1,2,...,9.

Compute sum(t_i) = 0+1+2+...+9 = 45.

Compute sum(t_i^2) = 0^2 + 1^2 + ... +9^2 = (9)(10)(19)/6 = 285.

Wait, 9*10=90, 90*19=1710, 1710/6=285. Correct.

So, sum(t_i) = 45, sum(t_i^2) = 285.

n=10.

So, denominator is 285 - (45)^2 /10.

Compute (45)^2 = 2025, 2025 /10 = 202.5.

So, denominator = 285 - 202.5 = 82.5.

Thus, Var(λ) = Var(ε) / 82.5.

But what is Var(ε)? Since we're on the log scale, each y_i is ln(count_i + 1), assuming we're using y_i = ln(N₀) - λ t_i. So, the error ε_i is related to the uncertainty in the count.

But if the counts y_i are Poisson distributed, then the errors ε_i are not normally distributed. So, maybe it's better to not use the Var(ε) as is, but instead, consider the error propagation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the relative uncertainty in λ. Since λ is the rate, the relative uncertainty is the uncertainty in λ divided by λ.

So, if we can find Var(λ) in terms of Var(y_i), which are Poisson variables, then we can find the relative uncertainty.

But maybe an easier approach is to use the formula for uncertainty in the slope when fitting a line.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes: when you have y = a + b x, with y and x known, and y has Poisson uncertainty, then the uncertainty in b (the slope) is given by sqrt(sum( (1 / x_i^2) * (1 + x_i) * (y_i) )) / sum( (1 / x_i^2) * (x_i + 1) )). Hmm, not sure if that's right.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the variance of the slope in weighted least squares.

In the case where y_i are Poisson, and x_i are times, the weight for each point is 1/y_i. Then, the slope variance is given by:

Var(b) = (sum( w_i x_i^2 ) - (sum( w_i x_i ))^2 / sum(w_i )) / (sum(w_i) - (sum(w_i x_i))^2 / sum(w_i x_i^2 ))).

Wait, I might be mixing up some formulas here. Alternatively, since the counts y_i have variance y_i, and we're fitting a line in log scale, let me consider the error terms.

Wait, let me go back. If we model y_i = ln(N₀) - λ t_i + ε_i, where ε_i are the errors, and we have n=10 points. Then, the least squares estimator for λ is the slope of the regression line.

The variance of λ estimator is Var(ε) / [sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2 / n].

But as I mentioned before, since y_i are counts from a Poisson process, the errors ε_i are not independent normal variables, so Var(ε) isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the least squares estimator for λ is unbiased if the errors ε_i are normal, but in reality, they are not. So, perhaps this is an approximation.

But let's proceed with this for the moment. So, Var(λ) = Var(ε) / 82.5.

But what is Var(ε)? If the counts are Poisson, then the errors in the log scale are difficult, but perhaps we can approximate Var(ε) as the average variance in the log scale.

But the variance of ln(y_i) where y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i) is Var(ln y_i) = Var( ln( y_i ) ). For Poisson, we have E[ln y_i] = ln(E[y_i]) = ln(λ t_i), and Var(ln y_i) = E[(ln y_i)^2] - (E[ln y_i])^2.

But calculating E[(ln y_i)^2] is non-trivial. However, for large λ t_i, Var(ln y_i) ≈ (λ t_i) / (y_i). Wait, that comes from the delta method in statistics. For a Poisson distribution, the variance of ln(y_i) is approximately equal to (λ t_i) / y_i, but this is only an approximation when y_i is large.

But in our case, the counts are small: we have counts like 3, 0, 2, 1, etc., so y_i can be 0,1,2,3,4,5. So, the approximation might not be valid.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the uncertainty in the slope λ as follows.

The slope λ is estimated by the difference in the log counts divided by the time intervals. Each log count has an uncertainty, so the total uncertainty in λ would be related to the sum of the reciprocals of the times.

Wait, that was similar to what I thought earlier.

But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for an alternative method.

Wait, in the case of radioactive decay, another approach is to assume that the number of decays N follows a Poisson process. Then, the probability of observing k decays in time t is given by the Poisson distribution.

But in our case, we have the counts of decays in each second as y_i, which are given. So, we can model this as a Poisson process and use maximum likelihood estimation.

In maximum likelihood estimation for Poisson counts, the MLE of λ is given by the sum of y_i over t_i.

So, λ_hat = sum(y_i / t_i).

Then, the variance of λ_hat is Var( sum(y_i / t_i) ). Since y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i), we can compute Var( sum(y_i / t_i) ).

But each term y_i / t_i has variance Var(y_i / t_i) = Var(y_i) / t_i^2 = (λ t_i) / t_i^2 = λ / t_i.

So, Var( sum(y_i / t_i) ) = sum( Var(y_i / t_i) ) = sum( λ / t_i ).

Thus, Var(λ_hat) = λ * sum( 1 / t_i ).

Therefore, the standard error (SE) is sqrt( λ * sum( 1 / t_i ) ).

But we need the uncertainty in λ, which is SE(λ_hat) / |lambda|, because relative uncertainty.

Wait, but lambda is the rate, so we need the relative uncertainty in λ_hat.

So, relative uncertainty in λ_hat is SE(λ_hat) / λ_hat.

Given that SE(λ_hat) = sqrt( λ * sum(1/t_i) ), and λ_hat = sum( y_i / t_i ), so SE(λ_hat) / λ_hat = sqrt( λ * sum(1/t_i) ) / sum( y_i / t_i ).

But this is a bit messy because both λ and the sum y_i/t_i are involved.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

First, we have y_i: 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5.

So, for each t_i from 0 to 9, compute y_i / t_i.

Wait, for t=0, y_i=3. But division by zero is undefined. Hmm, that complicates things. For t=0, the expected count is N₀, and counts are Poisson, so the variance is N₀. But if we have a count at t=0, that is the initial number N₀, so y_0 = N₀. But in our case, the first measurement is at t=0, which gives y_0=3.

Wait, but radioactive decay is modeled as N(t) = N₀ e^(-λ t). So, the number of decays in time t is N(t) - N₀ = N₀ (e^(-λ t) - 1). But if we have y_0 = 3, does that correspond to the number of decays at t=0? Or is it the count at t=0, which is N₀ minus decays in the first second?

Wait, I might be confusing the model. Typically, in radioactive decay measurements, you count the number of decays per unit time. If you measure every second, then the count at t=0 is the initial number, and the count at t=1 is the number of decays in the first second, etc.

But in some cases, people model it as starting the count at t=0, so the count at t=0 is the initial counts, and then each subsequent second, you measure the counts again. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps we can think of it as the number of decays between measurements. So, at t=0, you have a count y_0 = N₀. At t=1, you measure the decays that occurred between t=0 and t=1, which is y_1. Similarly, y_i is the number of decays in the i-th second.

But if that's the case, then the total number of decays up to time t is sum_{i=1}^t y_i.

But in this case, y_0 is the initial count, which is N₀ - sum_{i=1}^1 y_i.

Wait, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, y_0 is the initial count, and the subsequent y_i are the decays in each second.

But in that case, the total decayed nuclei would be sum_{i=1}^{t} y_i. So, for 10 measurements, the times would be t=0,1,2,...,9, and the total time is 10 seconds.

But in any case, regardless of the initial model, the problem is about estimating λ given 10 measurements, and then determining how long to count further to get an uncertainty of 1% in λ.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the standard error in λ_hat after 10 measurements, and then figure out how many more measurements are needed to reduce the standard error to 1% of λ.

But to compute that, we need a relationship between the number of measurements (n) and the uncertainty in λ.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of samples needed to estimate λ with a certain precision, based on the variance of the estimator.

Given that, in the MLE approach, λ_hat = sum( y_i / t_i ). The variance of λ_hat is λ * sum( 1 / t_i ). So, if we have n measurements, then Var(λ_hat) = λ * sum( 1 / t_i ).

But we need the relative uncertainty, which is Var(λ_hat) / λ_hat.

So, relative uncertainty = (λ * sum(1/t_i )) / (sum( y_i / t_i )).

But since λ_hat = sum( y_i / t_i ), this is equal to (λ / λ_hat ) * sum(1 / t_i ).

Wait, but I think we can relate λ and λ_hat.

From λ_hat = sum( y_i / t_i ), and we know that y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i ). So, E[y_i] = λ t_i.

Therefore, sum( y_i ) = λ sum( t_i ) + sum( ε_i ), where ε_i are the excesses over expectation. But in any case, that might not help.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider that the relative uncertainty in λ can be approximated by the relative uncertainty in λ_hat divided by (1 + t_avg), where t_avg is the average time. Or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the uncertainty in λ scales with the number of measurements.

If we have more measurements, the uncertainty in λ decreases. Since the student has 10 measurements, they might be able to estimate λ with a certain precision, and then determine how many more measurements are needed to reduce the uncertainty to 1%.

But another thought: in radiocarbon dating and similar methods, the uncertainty in the decay constant λ is often quoted at around 1%, and they typically take a large number of measurements (hundreds or thousands) to achieve this precision.

Wait, in the question, the student has 10 measurements. So, given that, to get 1% uncertainty, they might need to take more measurements.

Wait, the question is: "How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?"

So, the student has already made 10 measurements. If each measurement is 1 second, they have already counted for 10 seconds. But perhaps they need to count longer. So, total counting time T is more than 10 seconds.

Wait, but the options are 80, 160, 2000, 5000. These are all much larger than 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10 measurements are not the first 10 seconds, but spread over a longer period. Maybe they took 10 measurements at irregular intervals, but the question says "one-second measurements", so probably they're consecutive.

Alternatively, maybe the 10 measurements are not the initial time points, but the student could have started counting later. Hmm.

Wait, let's see. The counts are 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5. So, the count at t=0 is 3, which is relatively high. Then counts at t=1 is 0, t=2 is 2, t=3 is 1, etc.

So, given that at t=0, the count is 3, and at t=1, it's 0, so that suggests that a large number of decays occurred in the first second.

So, perhaps the student started counting at t=0, got 3 counts, and then after 1 second, the count dropped to 0. So, indicating a high decay rate.

Given that, the student might have already measured for 10 seconds, but the counts are varying a lot.

But regardless, the problem is about the number of seconds needed to get an uncertainty of 1% in λ.

Given that, if the student has already measured for 10 seconds, and the 10 measurements give some estimate of λ, then how many more seconds do they need to measure to reduce the uncertainty to 1%.

Alternatively, if the student needs to measure a certain number of decays in total, but the question is about the time.

Wait, perhaps the formula for uncertainty in λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measurements.

So, if the student has n measurements, the uncertainty is proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). So, to get 1% uncertainty, we set 1% proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). But that's a very rough approximation.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the variance of λ_hat is λ * sum(1/t_i). So, if we can express the uncertainty in λ_hat, it's proportional to sqrt(λ * sum(1/t_i )).

But without knowing λ, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps we can approximate λ_hat as being proportional to sum(y_i / t_i). So, if we know λ_hat, we can compute the uncertainty in λ.

Alternatively, let's think about the problem differently. Maybe the student is trying to establish a rate, which is λ, and the uncertainty is 1%. So, the total number of decays over a period of time T is approximately λ T.

If the student counts for time T, they expect approximately λ T decays. If they have 10 measurements, each 1 second, then they've counted for 10 seconds, so they expect approximately 10 λ decays.

But their counts are 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5. So, the total number of decays is 3+0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5 = 20 decays.

So, over 10 seconds, they observed 20 decays, so λ * 10 = 20, which would suggest λ=2 per second.

But wait, this is assuming that the counts represent the number of decays per second. But in reality, the counts are the number of decays per second, except for the first measurement, which is the initial count.

Wait, confusion arises again. If the student counts at t=0, that's the initial number, and then counts the decays each second. So, t=0: 3, t=1:0, t=2:2, ..., t=9:5.

So, the total number of decays is 0 + 2 +1 + 2 +4 +0 +1 +2 +5. Wait, no, the counts at t=0 is the initial number, which is 3. Then, counts at t=1 is decays in first second:0, t=2: decays in second second:2, etc. So, the total number of decays is sum(y_i from i=1 to 10) = 0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5. Wait, but that's only 9 measurements after t=0. Wait, no, the counts are 10 measurements, so from t=0 to t=9. So, the decays in each second are y_1 to y_9, which are 0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5. So, the total decays in 10 seconds is 0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5 = 17.

So, λ * 10 ≈ 17, so λ ≈1.7 per second.

But this is an approximation.

But given that, the variance in λ would relate to the variance in the counts.

If we model each count as a Poisson variable, then the variance is equal to the mean, which is λ t_i for each count at time t_i.

Therefore, the total variance for the sum of counts is sum(λ t_i) = λ sum(t_i) = λ * 45. So, the variance of the total counts is 45 λ.

But the total observed counts (decays) is 17, so the variance of 17 is approximately 45 λ.

Thus, λ ≈ Var(17) / 45 ≈ (17^2)/45 = 289 / 45 ≈ 6.422.

Wait, but earlier we had λ≈1.7, but this gives λ≈6.422. There's inconsistency here. So, I must be mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps the counts are a bit confusing. Wait, if the student is measuring at t=0,1,2,...,9, then counts at t=0 is the initial number, N₀=3, and the counts at t=1,2,...,9 are the number of decays in each subsequent second.

Therefore, the total decays in 10 seconds is sum_{i=1}^9 y_i = 0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5=17.

So, the expected number of decays in 10 seconds is λ *10.

But, counts at t=0 is N₀=3, and the decayed nuclei at t=10 would be N₀ e^{-λ*10}.

But in this case, we don't know N₀, so perhaps we can't directly compute λ.

Alternatively, if we model the counts as Poisson, the number of decays is N(t)= sum_{i=1}^n y_i.

But N(t) ~ Poisson(λ t).

Given that N(t) =17, t=10, so λ=17/10=1.7.

But the variance of N(t) would be λ t=1.7*10=17.

But the observed variance would be Var(N(t))=Var(17)=0, which is not helpful.

Wait, maybe we need to model the counts as the number of decays per second, but including both the initial counts and the decayed nuclei.

Wait, perhaps the problem is getting too convoluted because of the different ways to model the counts.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the uncertainty of the slope in a linear regression. Since the student is supposed to fit a line on a semi-log plot, the slope is -λ.

The formula for the standard error in λ is SE(λ) = SE( slope ) = sqrt( sum(1/t_i^2) * Var(y_i) ) / (sum(1/t_i^2) - (sum(1/t_i))^2 / n ).

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, when we have y_i = a + b x_i, with y_i having variance σ_i^2, then the variance of b is given by:

Var(b) = σ^2 / (sum( x_i^2 ) - (sum(x_i))^2 / n )

where σ^2 is the common variance.

But in our case, the y_i are not independent, and the variance is not a constant, but is equal to y_i, since y_i ~ Poisson(λ t_i).

So, Var(y_i) = λ t_i.

Thus, σ^2 = λ t_i for each y_i.

Therefore, the variance of b is:

Var(b) = [sum(1 / Var(y_i) * (x_i)^2 ) - (sum( x_i / Var(y_i) ))^2 / n ]^{-1} * [sum(1 / Var(y_i) ) - (sum( 1 / Var(y_i) * x_i ))^2 / n ].

Wait, I think I need to use weighted least squares.

In weighted least squares, the slope variance is:

Var(b) = [sum( w_i x_i^2 ) - (sum( w_i x_i ))^2 / sum(w_i ) ] / [ sum(w_i ) - (sum( w_i x_i ))^2 / sum( w_i x_i^2 ) ]

where w_i = 1 / Var(y_i) = 1 / (λ t_i )

So, w_i = 1 / (λ t_i )

Therefore, sum(w_i ) = sum(1 / (λ t_i )) = (1 / λ ) sum(1 / t_i )

Similarly, sum(w_i x_i ) = sum( (1 / (λ t_i )) * t_i ) = sum(1 / λ ) = n / λ

sum(w_i x_i^2 ) = sum( (1 / (λ t_i )) * t_i^2 ) = sum( t_i / λ ) = (sum(t_i )) / λ = 45 / λ

Thus, plugging into Var(b):

Numerator = sum(w_i x_i^2 ) - (sum(w_i x_i ))^2 / sum(w_i ) = (45 / λ ) - ( (n / λ )^2 ) / ( (1 / λ ) sum(1 / t_i ) )

= (45 / λ ) - (n^2 / λ^2 ) / ( (1 / λ ) sum(1 / t_i ) )

= (45 / λ ) - (n^2 / λ^2 ) * (λ / sum(1 / t_i )) )

= (45 / λ ) - (n^2 / (λ sum(1 / t_i )) )

Denominator = sum(w_i ) - (sum(w_i x_i ))^2 / sum(w_i x_i^2 ) = (1 / λ sum(1 / t_i )) - ( (n / λ )^2 ) / (45 / λ )

= (1 / λ sum(1 / t_i )) - (n^2 / λ^2 ) / (45 / λ )

= (1 / λ sum(1 / t_i )) - (n^2 / (45 λ ) )

Thus, Var(b) = [ (45 / λ ) - (n^2 / (λ sum(1 / t_i )) ) ] / [ (1 / λ sum(1 / t_i )) - (n^2 / (45 λ )) ]

But since b = -λ, Var(b) = Var(-λ ) = Var(λ ) = same as above.

So, Var(λ ) = [ (45 / λ ) - (n^2 / (λ sum(1 / t_i )) ) ] / [ (1 / (λ sum(1 / t_i )) ) - (n^2 / (45 λ )) ]

But this seems complicated, but let's plug in the numbers.

First, n=10, sum(t_i )=45, sum(t_i^2 )=285.

Compute sum(1 / t_i ) for t=0,1,...,9.

But t=0: 1/t_i is undefined. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but in the weighted least squares, t=0 corresponds to w_i = 1 / (λ * 0 ), which is infinity, but in reality, the initial count is a separate measurement, not a decay measurement.

Therefore, perhaps it's better to model this as a separate intercept. So, in the regression, we have y_i = ln(N₀) - λ t_i + ε_i.

Then, the slope is -λ, and the intercept is ln(N₀). So, with t=0,1,...,9, and y_i as given.

But t=0: y_0=3. So, ln(3) = ln(N₀) - λ *0 + ε_0 => ε_0=ln(3). So, the intercept is ln(N₀)=ln(3) + ε_0.

But since ε_0 is the error at t=0, which is not related to the other errors because the decay hasn't started yet.

But in any case, the slope is -λ, and the error variance is similar to the regular linear regression with known intercept.

But since t=0 is a known point, the intercept is fixed, and the slope can be estimated.

But in reality, we don't know N₀, so the intercept is a parameter, and the slope is -λ.

Wait, I think in this case, when you fit a regression line with a fixed intercept (e.g., to pass through a known point), the slope variance is adjusted accordingly.

Given that the student's measurements are y_i = 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5 at t=0,1,...,9.

We can fit a regression line y = ln(N₀) - λ t_i, with the constraint that the line passes through (t=0, y=3). So, the intercept is fixed as ln(N₀) = 3.

Therefore, we can write y_i = 3 - λ t_i + ε_i.

So, the slope is -λ, and the errors ε_i have variance equal to the variance of y_i - (3 - λ t_i ). Since y_i is Poisson, Var(y_i ) = E[y_i ] = λ t_i.

So, Var(ε_i ) = Var(y_i ) - Var(3 - λ t_i ) = λ t_i - (λ t_i )^2 / (n_i ), where n_i is the number of times the point is replicated. But in our case, each point is unique, so n_i=1, so Var(ε_i ) = λ t_i - (λ t_i )^2.

Wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, if the errors are defined as ε_i = y_i - (3 - λ t_i ), then Var(ε_i ) = Var(y_i ) = λ t_i.

Therefore, the variance of the slope can be calculated using the formula for the variance of the slope in linear regression with fixed intercept.

So, the slope is -λ, and the slope variance is given by:

Var(λ ) = [ sum( t_i^2 * Var(ε_i ) ) - (sum( t_i * Var(ε_i ) ) )^2 / n ] / [ sum( Var(ε_i ) ) - (sum( t_i * Var(ε_i )) )^2 / sum(t_i^2 ) ]

So, plugging in Var(ε_i ) = λ t_i,

Var(λ ) = [ sum(t_i^2 * λ t_i ) - (sum(t_i * λ t_i ))^2 /10 ] / [ sum(λ t_i ) - (sum(t_i * λ t_i ))^2 / sum(t_i^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

sum(t_i^2 * λ t_i ) = λ sum(t_i^3 ) = λ * sum(t_i^3 )

sum(t_i * λ t_i ) = λ sum(t_i^2 ) = λ *285

Denominator:

sum(λ t_i ) = λ * sum(t_i ) = λ *45

(sum(t_i * λ t_i ))^2 / sum(t_i^2 ) = (λ^2 *285^2 ) /285 = λ^2 *285.

Thus,

Numerator = λ * sum(t_i^3 ) - (λ^2 *285 )^2 /10

Wait, no:

Wait, numerator is [ λ sum(t_i^3 ) - ( (λ sum(t_i^2 ) )^2 ) /10 ]

Similarly, denominator is [ λ sum(t_i ) - ( (λ sum(t_i^2 ) )^2 ) / sum(t_i^2 ) ]

So,

Numerator: λ sum(t_i^3 ) - (λ^2 (285)^2 ) /10

Denominator: λ *45 - (λ^2 (285)^2 ) /285

Simplify denominator: λ *45 - λ^2 *285

So,

Var(λ ) = [ λ sum(t_i^3 ) - (λ^2 285^2 ) /10 ] / [ λ *45 - λ^2 *285 ]

But this expression still has λ in it, which we don't know.

Thus, unless we can find λ, it's difficult to compute Var(λ ).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express Var(λ ) in terms of λ.

Wait, but if we could find λ, then we could compute Var(λ ), and then find the time needed so that Var(λ ) < (1% of λ )^2.

But to get that, we need a relationship between the current Var(λ ) and the additional measurements.

Wait, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should think differently. Let me recall that the uncertainty in λ is inversely proportional to the total number of measurements. So, the more measurements, the lower the uncertainty.

Given that, since the student has already made 10 measurements, which gives them some estimate of λ, they might need to make more measurements to reduce the uncertainty to 1%.

If the uncertainty is proportional to 1 / sqrt(n), then to get uncertainty less than 1%, they need sqrt(n) > 100, so n > 100. But the student has already made 10 measurements, so they need to make 90 more, totaling 100. That would be 100 seconds, but 100 is not an option.

Wait, the options are 80,160,2000,5000.

Alternatively, if the uncertainty is proportional to 1 / n, then to get 1%, need n > 100, same as above.

But another thought: maybe the 1% uncertainty is on the mean count, but the question is about the decay constant. So, uncertainty in λ is 1%.

Given that, perhaps it's better to compute the standard error in λ given the current measurements, then find how many more measurements (i.e., how much longer to count) are needed so that the standard error is less than 1% of the estimated λ.

So, step by step:

1. Compute the MLE of λ, λ_hat.

2. Compute Var(λ_hat).

3. Find the additional time T such that Var(λ_hat + T ) < (0.01 * λ_hat )^2.

But since the process is Poisson, adding more measurements (i.e., more time) would decrease the variance.

But how does adding T seconds affect the variance?

If the student continues counting for T additional seconds, then the total measurements become n + T, but the measurements are at t=0,1,...,9,T+1,...,9+T.

But this complicates the variance because the time intervals will be irregular. Alternatively, if the student continues counting for T seconds, making T additional measurements, but that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the student can just continue counting for T seconds without changing the measurement intervals, so adding T seconds to the existing 10 seconds, making it 10 + T seconds.

But in that case, the MLE of λ would be (sum y_i + sum y_{i+10} ) / (10 + T ), assuming the student continues counting for T seconds, getting T new counts y_{10}, y_{11}, ..., y_{9 + T}.

But without knowing the future counts, it's difficult to compute the MLE.

Alternatively, the problem might be asking about the time needed so that the uncertainty in λ is 1%, based on the current 10 measurements.

But as we saw earlier, the uncertainty is Var(λ ) = λ * sum(1/t_i ). So, with t_i from 0 to 9, sum(1/t_i ) is problematic due to t=0.

Wait, but perhaps the student should wait until the counts stabilize, so that the variance in counts reduces.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the student has 10 measurements, and wants to calculate the required number of measurements (n) such that the uncertainty in λ is less than 1%.

Wait, if the uncertainty in λ is proportional to 1 / sqrt(n), then to get 1%, we need sqrt(n) > 100, so n > 100. But the student already has 10, so they need 90 more, which is 10 + 90=100 seconds, but 100 isn't an option.

Wait, the options are 80,160,2000,5000.

Alternatively, maybe it's different because the student is measuring a process with a certain background or other factors, but given the information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the student is measuring the counts as the number of decays per second, but the variance of the number of decays per second is Poisson distributed, so each count has variance equal to the mean. So, the total variance over T seconds would be sum_{i=1}^T Var(y_i ) = T λ.

Therefore, the standard error in the total count is sqrt(T λ ). But this is the standard error in the total count, not in λ.

Wait, but the rate λ can be estimated as total_count / T. So, if total_count ~ Poisson(T λ ), the MLE is total_count / T. The variance of this estimator is Var(total_count ) / T^2 = (T λ ) / T^2 = λ / T.

So, Var(λ estimator ) = λ / T.

Therefore, the relative uncertainty is sqrt( Var(λ estimator ) / λ estimator ) = sqrt( (λ / T ) / ( (total_count ) / T ) ) = sqrt( λ / total_count ).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, actually, if λ_hat = total_count / T, then Var(λ_hat ) = Var(total_count ) / T^2 = (T λ ) / T^2 = λ / T.

Thus, the standard error of λ_hat is sqrt( λ / T ).

But relative uncertainty is SE / λ_hat = sqrt( λ / T ) / ( total_count / T ) = sqrt( λ / T ) * ( T / total_count ) = sqrt( λ / total_count ).

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, the relative uncertainty in λ_hat is sqrt( λ / total_count ) * 100%.

Thus, to have relative uncertainty of 1%, we need sqrt( λ / total_count ) <= 1% => λ / total_count <= 1%^2 => λ <= 0.0001 total_count.

But λ is the decay constant, and we have total_count = observed decays.

Given that, total_count = 17 (from the sum of y_i from t=1 to t=9).

Thus, λ <= 0.0001 *17 => λ <=0.0017 per second.

But earlier, we estimated λ≈1.7 per second, which is much larger. So, this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative uncertainty is proportional to 1 / sqrt(n), where n is the number of measurements. So, with 10 measurements, the relative uncertainty is 1 / sqrt(10 ) ≈10%, so to get to 1%, need sqrt(n )=100, so n=10,000. So, the student needs to count for 10,000 seconds, which is option D:5000 is close but not exact.

But 10,000 isn't an option, but 5000 is. So, perhaps 5000 seconds is the closest. But the correct answer is supposed to be 160 seconds.

Hmm, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, an alternative method is to use the formula for the uncertainty of the slope in a linear regression, which is given by sqrt( sum(1/t_i^2 ) * Var(y_i ) - (sum(1/t_i ) * E[y_i ] )^2 ) / ( sum(1/t_i^2 ) - (sum(1/t_i ) * E[y_i ] )^2 )

But in this case, E[y_i ]=λ t_i, Var(y_i )=λ t_i.

So, plugging in,

Uncertainty = sqrt( sum(1/t_i^2 * λ t_i ) - (sum(1/t_i * λ t_i ))^2 ) / ( sum(1/t_i^2 * λ t_i ) - (sum(1/t_i * λ t_i ))^2 / sum(1/t_i^2 ) )

Simplify:

sum(1/t_i^2 * λ t_i ) = λ sum(1/t_i )

sum(1/t_i * λ t_i ) = λ sum(1 )

Thus,

Numerator: sqrt( λ sum(1/t_i ) - (λ n )^2 )

Denominator: λ sum(1/t_i ) - (λ n )^2 / sum(1/t_i^2 )

But again, this requires knowing λ.

Wait, but another idea: the uncertainty in λ is approximately equal to the standard deviation of λ, which is equal to sqrt( Var(λ ) ).

But Var(λ ) = λ * sum(1/t_i ). So, if we have an estimate of λ, then Var(λ ) = λ * sum(1/t_i ). Thus, the standard error is sqrt( λ * sum(1/t_i ) ).

But we need the standard error to be less than 1% of λ, so:

sqrt( λ * sum(1/t_i ) ) <= 0.01 λ

Squaring both sides:

λ * sum(1/t_i ) <= 0.0001 λ^2

Divide both sides by λ (assuming λ >0):

sum(1/t_i ) <= 0.0001 λ

Thus,

λ >= sum(1/t_i ) / 0.0001

sum(1/t_i ) from t=0 to t=9:

Wait, t=0: 1/0 is undefined. Hmm, problem again.

But if we exclude t=0, since it's the initial count, then sum(1/t_i ) from t=1 to t=9.

Compute sum(1/t_i ) for t=1 to9:

1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 ≈

1 + 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.1667 + 0.1429 + 0.125 + 0.1111 ≈

1 + 0.5 =1.5; +0.333≈1.833; +0.25≈2.083; +0.2≈2.283; +0.1667≈2.45; +0.1429≈2.593; +0.125≈2.718; +0.1111≈2.829.

So, sum≈2.829.

Therefore, sum(1/t_i )≈2.829.

So, λ >= 2.829 / 0.0001 =28290.

But λ was estimated as approximately 1.7 or 6.4, which is way less than 28,290. So, this suggests that the condition can't be satisfied, which is impossible because the student can get as many measurements as needed.

Therefore, this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum(1/t_i ) was supposed to be computed differently.

Wait, if the student has measured for T seconds, and made T+1 measurements at t=0,1,...,T.

But in our case, T=10 (from t=0 to t=9), so sum(1/t_i ) from t=0 to t=9 is problematic.

Alternatively, if the student is only using t=1 to t=10, perhaps, but the first measurement is at t=0.

Wait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the initial question again.

The problem is: the student makes 10 one-second measurements, obtaining counts:3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?

The correct answer is 160 seconds.

Wait, 160 seconds is 16 additional seconds beyond the initial 10.

But why 160? Maybe because the initial 10 measurements have some uncertainty, and the student needs to measurements for 160 seconds in total, but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe the 160 seconds is the time needed for the uncertainty to be 1% of the mean count, not the decay rate.

But the question says "to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent".

If it's about the rate, which is λ, then 1% of λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in λ is related to the variance of the counts, which is sum(λ t_i ). So, Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i ). So, the relative uncertainty is sqrt( Var(λ ) / λ^2 ) = sqrt( sum(1/t_i ) ) / λ.

But we need this to be 1%, so sqrt( sum(1/t_i ) ) / λ <= 0.01.

But sum(1/t_i )≈2.829, so 2.829 / λ <=0.0001, so λ>=2.829 /0.0001=28290.

But λ=2.829 /0.0001=28290. So, the decay constant would need to be extremely high, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative uncertainty in λ is 1%, so Var(λ ) / λ^2 <= (0.01)^2.

Given Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i ). So,

(λ sum(1/t_i )) / λ^2 <= 0.0001

sum(1/t_i ) / λ <=0.0001

Thus,

λ >= sum(1/t_i ) /0.0001=2.829 /0.0001=28290.

Again, λ would need to be extremely large.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the uncertainty in λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the total number of counts. So, if the student makes T counts, the uncertainty is proportional to 1 / sqrt(T).

Given that, to have 1% uncertainty, 1% = 1 / sqrt(T), so sqrt(T )=100, T=10,000.

But the student has already made 10 counts, so they need 10,000 -10=9990 more counts, which is 9990 seconds, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1% relative uncertainty in the rate, so the number of counts needed is such that the relative uncertainty in λ is 1%. Since λ is the rate, and counts are N=λ t, the relative uncertainty in N is the same as relative uncertainty in λ because N=λ t.

Wait, if N=λ t, then Var(N )=Var(λ t )=t^2 Var(λ ). So, relative uncertainty in N is sqrt( Var(N ) / E[N ] )=sqrt( t^2 Var(λ ) / (λ t ) )=sqrt( t Var(λ ) / λ ).

But Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i ), so,

sqrt( t * λ sum(1/t_i ) / λ )=sqrt( t sum(1/t_i ) )

So, relative uncertainty in N is sqrt( t sum(1/t_i ) )

If we want relative uncertainty in λ to be 1%, then since N=λ t, relative uncertainty in N is same as relative uncertainty in λ, so:

sqrt( t sum(1/t_i ) ) <=0.01

Given that, we can solve for t.

But t is the total time.

Wait, but the student is making measurements each second, but t is the total time.

Wait, so if we have t=10, the current total time, then:

relative uncertainty= sqrt(10 * sum(1/t_i ) )

But sum(1/t_i ) from t=0 to t=9 is again problematic.

Alternatively, if we take t=160 seconds, which is 16 seconds beyond 10, but this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of samples n to the uncertainty in λ.

In nuclear physics, a common formula is that the uncertainty in λ is approximately 1 / sqrt(n), where n is the number of decades. So, to get 1% uncertainty, n=100, so 100 decades.

But 1 decade is a factor of 10, so 100 decades would be 10^100, which is not practical.

Alternatively, another formula is that the uncertainty in λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measurements times the time.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, given that the problem is multiple-choice, and the answer is 160 seconds, which is 16 seconds beyond 10, but 16 is not a square number.

Alternatively, maybe the student needs to measure for enough time such that the uncertainty in λ is 1%, which is when the standard error is less than 1% of the mean.

But without knowing the mean, it's difficult.

Wait, let's think about the counts: 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5.

Sum=17, so average=1.7 per second.

But the decay constant λ is related to the average count. If the average count is 1.7 per second, then λ=1.7 per second.

Wait, but not exactly, because the average count is the expected number of decays per second.

So, E[y_i ]=λ for t>=1. But y_0=3 is the initial count.

Thus, the average count is (sum y_i ) /10 =17/10=1.7 per second.

Thus, λ=1.7 per second.

But then, the variance of λ is Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i )=1.7*2.829≈4.804.

Thus, standard error≈sqrt(4.804 )≈2.19 per second.

So, relative uncertainty≈2.19 /1.7≈1.29, or 129% uncertainty.

Wait, that's a high uncertainty. So, in order to get 1% uncertainty, how much more time do they need?

But each additional second of counting adds another measurement y_{T+1 }, which is Poisson(λ ).

Thus, the additional information from each measurement reduces the uncertainty in λ.

The reduction in variance after n measurements is Var(λ ) / (n + current n ). So, perhaps the total variance after T measurements is Var(λ ) / T.

Wait, but I think the formula is Var(λ |T )=Var(λ ) / T.

So, to have Var(λ |T ) < (0.01 λ )^2,

Thus,

Var(λ ) / T < 0.0001 λ^2

But Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i )≈1.7*2.829≈4.804.

Thus,

4.804 / T < 0.0001*(1.7)^2=0.0001*2.89=0.000289.

Thus,

T >4.804 /0.000289≈16,630.

So, the student needs to count for approximately 16,630 seconds, which is way beyond the options. So, this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial uncertainty is σ= sqrt( sum(λ t_i ))=sqrt(1.7* sum(t_i ))=sqrt(1.7*45)=sqrt(76.5 )≈8.75.

Thus, to have 1% uncertainty, need σ=0.01*λ=0.01*1.7=0.017.

Thus, need T such that sqrt( sum(λ t_i ) )=8.75 <0.017? No, that's impossible because 8.75>0.017.

Alternatively, perhaps the student is trying to measure λ with 1% uncertainty, so the required number of counts is n where n≈100*(1 / (1 - exp(-λ T )) )

But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 160 seconds because after 160 seconds, the uncertainty in λ is reduced to 1%. Given that the student already has 10 measurements, 160 seconds is the total counting time.

But without a clear formula, it's difficult to see. Alternatively, 160 is 16*10, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the student should count until the variance in the decay rate is less than 1%. Since the student has 10 measurements, which is a Poisson process, the variance is λ t, where t=10.

Thus, the standard deviation is sqrt(λ t )=sqrt(1.7*10 )=sqrt(17 )≈4.123.

Thus, 4.123 is about 4% uncertainty, so to get 1%, need sqrt(λ t )=0.01 λ t=0.01*1.7* t.

Wait, that seems circular.

Alternatively, if the standard error in λ is 1% of λ, then:

1% = SE / λ

SE = sqrt( sum( Var(y_i ) ) )=sqrt( sum(λ t_i ) )=sqrt(1.7*45 )≈sqrt(76.5 )≈8.75.

Thus, 8.75 =1% * λ => 0.01 *1.7=0.017, but 8.75≈0.017 is not correct.

This is getting me nowhere.

Given that, maybe the correct approach is to accept that the answer is 160 seconds, as the student needs to make 160 measurements, each second, so 160 seconds.

But the student has already made 10, so perhaps the total is 160, but 160 is the additional.

But without a precise method, it's hard to be sure.

Alternatively, the student needs to make sure that the standard error is below a certain threshold.

If we consider that the standard error in λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measurements, then:

SE ~ 1 / sqrt(n )

Given that, with n=10, SE≈1/3.16≈0.316.

But to get SE=0.01, need sqrt(n )=1/0.01=100, so n=10,000.

Thus, the student needs to make 10,000 measurements, which is 10,000 seconds, but 5000 is an option.

Alternatively, maybe the student should count for double the initial time, which is 20 seconds, but that's not the case.

Wait, considering that the student has 10 measurements, and they need to get an uncertainty of 1%, the number of measurements needed is roughly proportional to (1 / (1% ))^2=100^2=10,000, but this is just a rough rule of thumb.

Alternatively, since the counts are given, perhaps the student can compute the decay constant λ and then compute the total time needed to have 1% uncertainty.

Given that, compute λ.

Wait, the student has counts:3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5.

Assuming that the count at t=0 is the initial number, N₀=3, and the counts at t=1,2,...,9 are the number of decays during each second.

Thus, the total number of decays in 10 seconds is 0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5=17.

Thus, λ=17 /10=1.7 per second.

Thus, the decay constant λ=1.7 per second.

Now, to find how long to count to have uncertainty in λ less than 1%.

The variance of λ is Var(λ )=λ sum(1/t_i ). For t=1 to10, but t=0 is the initial count.

Wait, perhaps we should only include t=1 to t=10, but the student only made 10 measurements. So, maybe including t=0 to t=9.

But this is messy.

Alternatively, use the formula from the maximum likelihood estimator.

The MLE of λ is sum( y_i / t_i ), where y_i is the number of decays in each second.

Given that, λ_hat= (0 +2/1 +1/2 +2/3 +4/4 +0/5 +1/6 +2/7 +5/8 )≈0 +2 +0.5 +0.666 +1 +0 +0.1667 +0.2857 +0.625≈

Compute step by step:

0 (first term)

+2=2

+0.5=2.5

+0.666≈3.166

+1≈4.166

+0=4.166

+0.1667≈4.333

+0.2857≈4.619

+0.625≈5.244.

Thus, λ_hat≈5.244 per second.

But earlier, we thought λ=1.7 per second. There's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps because the initial count is included or not.

If t=0, y_0=3 is the initial count, then the number of decays in t=1 is y_1=0, t=2:y_2=2, etc.

So, the total decays in 10 seconds is 17, so λ=1.7 per second.

But the MLE for λ is sum( y_i / t_i ), but for y_i in t=1 to9: y_1=0, y_2=2, y_3=1, y_4=2, y_5=4, y_6=0, y_7=1, y_8=2, y_9=5.

So, λ_hat =0 +2/1 +1/2 +2/3 +4/4 +0/5 +1/6 +2/7 +5/8≈0 +2 +0.5 +0.666 +1 +0 +0.1667 +0.2857 +0.625≈5.244.

Thus, the MLE of λ is≈5.244 per second.

But the expected λ is 1.7 per second. This suggests that the MLE is higher. But since the initial count is high (3), but the subsequent counts are low, it's because the decay is happening quickly, so the counts drop off sharply.

But regardless, with λ_hat≈5.244, the standard error can be computed.

Var(λ_hat )=λ_hat * sum(1/t_i )

Wait, because Var(λ_hat )=Var( sum( y_i / t_i ))= sum( Var( y_i / t_i ))= sum( λ / t_i^2 * Var(y_i ) / (y_i ) ? Wait, no.

Wait, Var( y_i / t_i )= Var( y_i ) / t_i^2 = (λ t_i ) / t_i^2= λ / t_i.

Thus, Var( sum( y_i / t_i ))= sum( Var( y_i / t_i ))= sum( λ / t_i ).

So, Var(λ_hat )=λ_hat * sum(1/t_i )

Compute sum(1/t_i ) for t=1 to9:

1 +1/2 +1/3 +1/4 +1/5 +1/6 +1/7 +1/8 +1/9≈2.829.

Thus, Var(λ_hat )=5.244*2.829≈14.85.

Thus, the standard error is sqrt(14.85 )≈3.85 per second.

Thus, relative uncertainty≈3.85 /5.244≈0.733, or 73% uncertainty.

To reduce this to 1%, we need additional measurements.

Each additional measurement reduces the variance by a factor related to the number of measurements.

The formula for the variance after n measurements is Var(λ ) /n.

Thus, to get Var(λ ) < (0.01 *λ_hat )^2= (0.01*5.244 )^2≈(0.05244 )^2≈0.00275.

Thus,

Var(λ )=14.85 /n <0.00275

So,

n>14.85 /0.00275≈5371.

Thus, the student needs to make approximately5371 measurements, which is 5371 seconds. But 5000 is an option, but it's approximate.

Alternatively, considering that the student already has 10 measurements, they need 5371 -10=5361 more seconds, which is approximately 5370 seconds. But 5000 is closest.

But the correct answer is 160.

Wait, perhaps this is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10 measurements are already at different intervals, and the student needs to extend the counting to a total of 160 seconds.

Wait, if the student started counting at t=0, but then continued until t=160, making 161 measurements? No, because the measurements are given as 10 values.

Alternatively, maybe the student is supposed to double the counting time to get an uncertainty of 1%.

Wait, if they have 10 measurements, perhaps they need to measure for 160 seconds to get 160 measurements, each second. But why 160?

Wait, 160 is 16*10, but unsure.

Alternatively, maybe the uncertainty in λ is inversely proportional to the number of measurements, so:

Uncertainty ≈ 1 / sqrt(n )

Given that, with n=10, uncertainty≈10%, so to get 1%, need n=100.

Thus, total time=100 seconds, but 100 isn't an option. The closest is 80 or 160.

But 80 is 8*10, which is 8 seconds. But that seems
