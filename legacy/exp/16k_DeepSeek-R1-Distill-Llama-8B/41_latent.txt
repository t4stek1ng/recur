<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?. The options are: A. 80 s, B. 160 s, C. 2,000 s, D. 5,000 s.

Okay, so I have this question about radioactive disintegration measurements, and I need to figure out how long the student should count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent. The measurements taken are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. The options are 80 seconds, 160 seconds, 2000 seconds, or 5000 seconds. I need to understand why the correct answer is 160 seconds. Hmm, let me think about how radioactive decay works and what this means.

First, radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The formula is usually something like N(t) = N₀ * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number of undecayed nuclei at time t, N₀ is the initial number, and λ is the decay constant. But in this question, they're probably talking about the measurement of the decay rate, which is the slope of the decay curve. Since it's an exponential process, it's tricky to estimate the decay constant λ because you can't just take an average of the decay counts. Instead, you need to model the decay using the counts you observe.

The student made 10 one-second measurements. So, each measurement is the count of decays in one second. If the counts were Poisson distributed, which they often are in radioactive decay, the variance would be approximately equal to the mean. But in this case, the counts are given as specific numbers, so maybe they're using the method of least squares to find the best fit for the decay constant λ.

Alternatively, another approach in radioactive decay measurements is to model the decay process as a linear function on a semi-log scale. Taking the logarithm of the counts versus time gives a linear plot, and the slope of that line is -λ. So, perhaps the student is supposed to fit a line to these counts and then determine λ from the slope, and then see how long they need to count to get an uncertainty of 1% in λ.

Wait, but the problem says "to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent." So, the uncertainty is on the rate, which is λ, presumably. So, the question is, how many measurements (i.e., how many seconds of counting) do you need to take so that the uncertainty in λ is less than 1%? That probably relates to the precision of the slope estimation.

So, if they have 10 data points, each taken at 1 second intervals, but actually, the time points would be at t=0, t=1, t=2, up to t=9, right? Because the first measurement is at t=0, the next at t=1, and so on until t=9. Wait, but the measurements are 10 in total, so t goes from 0 to 9 seconds? Or maybe t from 0 to 10? Wait, no, because the first measurement is at t=0, then each subsequent is t=1, up to t=9, that's 10 measurements: t=0 to t=9. So, the time points are 0,1,2,...,9.

So, we have 10 data points at times 0 through 9 seconds, each with their respective counts. If we model the decay as a linear function on a semi-log scale, we can fit a straight line through these points, and the slope will give us λ. But each measurement has some uncertainty, and we need to find the number of seconds needed so that the uncertainty in λ is 1%.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the error propagation. If we have a certain number of measurements, we can estimate the uncertainty in λ, and then find how many more measurements (i.e., how much longer to count) are needed to make that uncertainty less than 1%.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the law of large numbers—estimating how many counts are needed so that the standard error in λ is small enough.

Wait, let's consider the method of least squares. If we have counts y_i at times t_i, we can set up a system to solve for λ. But in reality, when we take the logarithm, it's a linear regression in terms of λ and the intercept.

Let me define y_i = ln(N₀) - λ t_i + ε_i, where ε_i are the errors. Then the regression slope is -λ, so from the regression, we can estimate λ.

The variance of λ can be found using the formula for the variance of the slope in linear regression. The variance of λ is Var(ε) / (sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2 / n). So, Var(λ) = Var(ε) / [sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2 / n].

Thus, let's consider the method of least squares. If we have counts y_i at times t_i, we can set up a system to solve for λ. But in reality, when we take the logarithm, it's a linear regression in terms of λ and the intercept.

Let me define y_i = ln y_i = ln(N₀) - λ t_i + ε_i, where ε_i are the errors. Then the regression slope is -λ, so from the regression, we can estimate λ.
