<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is A. deflected in the +x-direction?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I came across this physics problem, and I want to understand why the correct answer is A. deflected in the +x-direction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. Okay, so when a charged particle is accelerated through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. The energy gained can be related to the electric potential energy change. The proton starts from rest, so initially, its kinetic energy is zero. After passing through the potential difference V, its kinetic energy becomes equal to eV, where e is the proton's charge.

Now, the proton then moves into a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The trajectory of the proton is not affected, which is interesting. Hmm, does that mean it doesn't deflect? But the question says that if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the proton's trajectory would change, meaning it would be deflected. So, in the first case, with V, the proton isn't deflected, but with 2V, it is.

I need to figure out why doubling the potential difference would cause the proton to deflect in a specific direction.

Let me recall some concepts. When a charged particle moves through an electric field, it experiences a force F_e = qE. Similarly, when it moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force F_m = q(v × B) (the Lorentz force). Since the proton is charged, it will experience both electric and magnetic forces.

In the initial setup, the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V. This gives it a velocity in the +z-direction. Then, it enters the region with E and B fields. Let me consider the forces acting on the proton.

Since the electric field is in the +x-direction and the magnetic field is in the +y-direction, the velocity of the proton is in the +z-direction. Therefore, the velocity is perpendicular to both E and B. 

Let's write down the forces:

1. Electric force: F_e = eE in the +x-direction because E is in +x and the proton's charge is positive.
2. Magnetic force: F_m = e(v × B). The velocity v is in +z, and B is in +y. The cross product v × B would be in the direction of (z × y) which is -x. But since the charge is positive, the magnetic force will be in the -x direction. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the cross product.

The right-hand rule: If the fingers are in the direction of velocity (z) and curl towards B (y), the thumb points in the direction of v × B. So, z is up, y is left, then v × B is down, which is -x. Therefore, the magnetic force F_m is -eE in the x-direction.

So, the total force on the proton is F_total = F_e + F_m = eE - eE = 0. That's why the trajectory isn't affected initially. The forces cancel each other out, so the proton moves in a straight line without deflection.

Now, if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the proton will have twice the initial kinetic energy. Let's calculate the velocity in that case.

The kinetic energy gained is e * 2V = 2eV. Since the mass of the proton is m, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = 2eV. So, v = sqrt(2eV * 2m) / m. Wait, actually, let me correct that.

The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum. The momentum gained due to the electric potential is p = sqrt(2m * eV). So, if V is doubled, the momentum becomes sqrt(2m * 2eV) = sqrt(4m eV) = 2 * sqrt(m eV). Therefore, the velocity is (2 * sqrt(m eV)) / m = 2v₀, where v₀ is the original velocity.

So, the velocity becomes twice as much, but still in the +z-direction.

Now, let's recalculate the forces with the higher velocity.

Electric force: F_e = eE in the +x-direction.

Magnetic force: F_m = e(v × B). The velocity is still in +z, and B is in +y. So, v × B is (z × y) = -x. Therefore, F_m = e(-x) direction, but again, the charge is positive, so F_m is -e(v × B) = -e(-x) = +e x-direction? Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no. The magnetic force is given by F_m = q(v × B). So, v is in +z, B is in +y. So, v × B is (z × y) = -x. Therefore, F_m = e(-x) direction. Since e is positive, F_m is in the -x direction.

So, total force is F_total = eE (from E) + (-eE) from F_m = 0. Wait, that can't be. That would imply that even with the higher velocity, the force cancels out, so no deflection. But the question says that when the potential difference is doubled, the trajectory is affected, meaning it's deflected.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Otherwise, maybe I should express E in terms of B and v. Let me compute v × B again.

Now, maybe I messed up the direction of the magnetic force. Let me clarify.
