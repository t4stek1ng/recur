<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Let M be a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with tape alphabet {blank,0,1}, and let C denote the (possibly infinite) computation of M starting with a blank tape.

Okay, so I've got this question about Turing machines, and I need to figure out which of the given problems are decidable. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have a single-tape deterministic Turing machine, M, with a tape alphabet consisting of blank, 0, and 1. The computation C is the possibly infinite computation starting from a blank tape. The input to each problem is M and a positive integer n. We need to determine which of the following are decidable:

I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.

II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.

III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.

The options are:
- A. None
- B. III only
- C. I and II only
- D. I and III only

The correct answer is apparently C, meaning both I and II are decidable. Let me try to figure out why.

Starting with Problem I: Is the computation C lasts for at least n steps decidable? Well, I know that a Turing machine's computation can either terminate or run indefinitely. Since we are starting with a blank tape, which I assume means all squares are initially blank, the machine could enter a loop where it keeps moving without ever terminating or printing anything.

But the question is specifically about the computation lasting for at least n steps. So, does there exist an algorithm or a way to determine in finite steps whether the machine will run for at least n steps or not?

Hmm. I remember that in computability theory, there's the concept of the halting problem, which is undecidable for Turing machines, even with a blank tape. But here, we're not asking whether the machine terminates or halts, but whether it survives for at least n steps.
