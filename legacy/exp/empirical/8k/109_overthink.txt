[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The peak wavelength is around 790 nm. The flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which I think means that the peak is on the redder side of the spectrum. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, the peak emission often shifts towards the red end because of their high redshift. So, if the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, that might suggest a significant redshift.

The question is about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth in a Lambda-CDM universe. The parameters given are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density Ω_Λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat. The answer is said to be 9 Gpc, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall some concepts. Comoving distance is the distance a comoving observer would measure, accounting for the expansion of the universe. It's calculated using the integral of 1/(a H(a)) da from a=1 to a=1/(1+z). The comoving distance D_c is given by:

D_c = (1/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z')

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Since the universe is flat, Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1, so that part is fine.

Now, what do I know about the peak wavelength in quasars? The peak emission often comes from the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. The peak wavelength is related to the temperature and the radius of the emitting region. The peak wavelength λ_peak is approximately inversely proportional to the temperature T of the accretion disk, because higher temperatures emit shorter wavelengths (blue) and lower temperatures emit longer wavelengths (red).

The temperature of the accretion disk can be estimated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σT^4. But since we're dealing with a single peak, maybe it's more about blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength λ_peak * T = constant, so T ≈ λ_peak / (constant). The constant is about 2.9 × 10^−3 m·K, so T ≈ 3.7 × 10^9 K / λ_peak (in meters).

Wait, actually, Wien's displacement law is λ_peak * T = b, where b is Wien's constant ≈ 2.897 × 10^−3 m·K. So T ≈ b / λ_peak.

If the peak is at 790 nm, which is 790 × 10^(-9) meters, so T ≈ 2.897e-3 / 790e-9 ≈ (2.897 / 790) × 10^6 K ≈ approximately 3.67 × 10^6 K.

Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it is for a quasar. So T ≈ 3.67e6 K.

But how does this temperature relate to redshift? If the quasar is at a high redshift z, then the observed wavelength λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z). So if the emitted peak is at some rest-frame wavelength, then the observed peak is longer due to redshift.

Wait, but in this case, the peak is at 790 nm, which is observed. So if the rest-frame peak were shorter, that would imply that the quasar's light is redshifted into the near-infrared. So z is significant.

So to find z, we need to figure out what the rest-frame peak wavelength would be. But I don't have the rest-frame peak. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that quasars have a characteristic peak in their spectrum.

Wait, maybe instead I should think about the relationship between the peak wavelength and redshift. For a quasar, the peak in the rest frame is often around 100-200 nm, which is in the far-ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet, but when observed, it's shifted into the optical or near-infrared.

So if λ_observed is 790 nm, then the rest-frame wavelength is λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + z). So (1 + z) = λ_obs / λ_rest. But without knowing λ_rest, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that quasars have a typical luminosity function and the peak wavelength can be used to estimate their redshift. But I think the key here is that the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is the peak.

Wait, but is 790 nm in the rest frame or observed? The question says "peak at wavelength of about 790 nm," without specifying, but I think it's observed because it's in the context of the electromagnetic spectrum as observed from Earth.

So, if it's observed at 790 nm, and assuming that the rest-frame peak is at a shorter wavelength, say, around 100-200 nm, which would imply a significant redshift.

So, let's assume λ_rest ≈ 100 nm (I think quasars often have their peak around 100-150 nm in the rest frame). So (1 + z) = 790 / 100 = 7.9. So z ≈ 6.9.

Wait, that's a very high redshift. Then, using this redshift, we can compute the comoving distance.

But wait, in a universe with matter density 0.3 and dark energy 0.7, the comoving distance formula would be D_c = (1/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

So plugging in z ≈ 7, let's compute that integral.

First, let's compute H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. To convert H0 to s^-1, we have to multiply by 1e3 km/s and divide by 1e6 Mpc, but actually, we can keep it in units of km/s/Mpc for calculation purposes.

The integral ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z') can be evaluated numerically or using approximation formulas.

I remember that for high redshift, the dark energy dominated universe will have E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_Λ) = sqrt(0.7) ≈ 0.8367.

Wait, but for z=7, is the universe dominated by dark energy?

Wait, at z=1, the matter and dark energy densities are comparable, but for higher z, matter density is higher. So, perhaps E(z) is dominated by Ω_m(1+z)^3.

So for z=7, Ω_m(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(8)^3 = 0.3*512 = 153.6. But Ω_Λ is 0.7, so E(z) = sqrt(153.6 + 0.7) ≈ sqrt(154.3) ≈ 12.42.

So E(z) is about 12.42.

But wait, for higher z, say up to z=2, dark energy starts to dominate. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, in the standard Lambda-CDM model, at low z (z < 1), dark energy starts to dominate, but matter density is higher at higher z.

So, for z=7, matter is still significant.

But perhaps it's better to look up a standard comoving distance calculator or use an approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated universe.

But for an accurate calculation, maybe we should use numerical integration.

Let me try to compute the integral numerically.

Define t = 1 + z, so z goes from 0 to 7, t goes from 1 to 8.

E(t) = sqrt(Ω_m * t^3 + Ω_Λ).

So we need to compute the integral from t=1 to t=8 of 1/E(t) dt.

Compute this integral step by step.

But maybe I can use the approximation for the integral ∫ dt / E(t) for E(t) = sqrt(a t^3 + b), where a=Ω_m=0.3, b=Ω_Λ=0.7.

This integral doesn't have an analytical solution, so we can use numerical methods.

Alternatively, using the look-up table or approximate formula.

I recall that for high z, when dark energy starts dominating, the integral can be approximated.

But for z=7, it's high, but perhaps still matter dominated.

Wait, maybe I can check some standard values.

But since I don't have a calculator, maybe I can approximate the integral.

Alternatively, I can break it into two parts: matter-dominated (z where E(t)=sqrt(t^3) and dark energy dominated (E(t)=sqrt(0.7)).

Wait, but for z=7, is the universe matter-dominated or dark energy-dominated?

At z=7, the matter density parameter is Ω_m(1+z)^3 = 0.3*(8)^3 = 0.3*512=153.6, while Ω_Λ is 0.7. So the matter density is still higher, so it's matter-dominated.

Wait, but actually, the expansion is dominated by the component whose density is growing faster. But in reality, the expansion is dominated by dark energy at z < 0.5, and matter before that.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that:

At z=1, matter and dark energy are comparable.

At z=0.5, matter starts to dominate.

Wait, not exactly.

Wait, actually, the transition occurs around z ≈ 0.5-0.6, where dark energy overtakes matter.

At higher z, matter density is higher, so matter dominates.

Wait, so for z=7, it's matter dominated.

So, the expansion at z=7 is dominated by matter.

Thus, E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3).

So, E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3).

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫(1 to 8) dt / sqrt(0.3*(t)^3) = ∫(1 to 8) t^{-3/2} / sqrt(0.3) dt.

Compute that integral:

∫ t^{-3/2} dt = (-2) t^{-1/2} + C.

So integral from 1 to 8 is (-2)(8^{-1/2} - 1^{-1/2}) / sqrt(0.3)

Compute:

sqrt(8) = 2√2 ≈ 2.828, so 8^{-1/2} = 1/(2√2) ≈ 0.3536

sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477

So, the integral ≈ (-2)(0.3536 - 1)/0.5477 ≈ (-2)(-0.6464)/0.5477 ≈ (1.2928)/0.5477 ≈ 2.36.

So the integral is approximately 2.36.

Therefore, comoving distance D_c = (1/H0) * 2.36.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

But wait, units: 1/H0 is in Mpc/(km/s). Wait, no, D_c is in Mpc, so we need to convert H0 to s^-1.

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70e3 m/s/Mpc.

So 1/H0 = 1/(70e3 m/s/Mpc) ≈ 1.42857e-5 s/Mpc.

But since D_c is (1/H0) * ∫ dt / E(t), which is in Mpc.

So, 2.36 * (1.42857e-5 s/Mpc) ≈ 2.36 * 1.42857e-5 ≈ 3.39e-5 Mpc.

But 1 Mpc = 1e6 km, so 3.39e-5 Mpc = 3.39e-5 * 1e6 km = 339 km. That can't be right because 9 Gpc is way larger.

Wait, I must have messed up the units.

Wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so 1/H0 is 1/(70 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 0.0142857 Mpc/(s). Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, 1 km/s is 1e3 m/s.

So H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70e3 m/s/Mpc.

Thus, 1/H0 = 1/(70e3 m/s/Mpc) = (1/70e3) s/Mpc = 1.42857e-5 s/Mpc.

So, D_c = (1.42857e-5 s/Mpc) * 2.36 ≈ 3.39e-5 Mpc.

But 3.39e-5 Mpc is 3.39e-5 * 1e6 km = 339,000 km = 0.339 Gpc.

But the answer is supposed to be 9 Gpc. Clearly, this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused E(z) with something else.

Wait, no, E(z) is the function in the integral. Maybe my assumption that it's matter-dominated is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate E(z) as matter-dominated.

Wait, maybe I should compute E(z) accurately for each z.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation.

Wait, I remember that for a universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=6.5 is about 6 Gpc, and at z=7 it's about 7 Gpc, but 9 Gpc is higher.

Wait, no, perhaps higher z gives higher D_c.

Wait, let me think.

I think that for the given parameters, the comoving distance at z=6.9 is about 7 Gpc.

But I might be confusing it with another parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the rest wavelength.

Wait, going back, the problem says that the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, and flux drops at shorter wavelengths.

So, perhaps that peak is the rest-frame peak? No, usually quasars have their peak in UV/optical, but if the peak is observed in near-IR, that suggests significant redshift.

So assuming that the rest-frame peak is at, say, 100 nm (which is in the far-UV), and observed at 790 nm, so (1 + z) = 790 / 100 = 7.9, so z≈6.9.

So, with z=7, let's compute D_c.

Given that in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, D_c at z=1 is about 1700 Mpc or so.

Wait, no, more accurately, for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=1 is D_c = (1/H0) * ∫(0 to1) dz/E(z).

Computing E(z) for z=0 to 1:

E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So, integral from 0 to1 of 1/E(z) dz.

We can approximate this integral numerically.

At z=0, E(0)=sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=sqrt(1)=1.

At z=1, E(1)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*8 + 0.7)=sqrt(2.4 + 0.7)=sqrt(3.1)≈1.761.

The integral from z=0 to z=1 is ∫(0 to1) dz/E(z).

To approximate, let's use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.

Divide the interval [0,1] into n steps, say n=2.

At z=0: E=1, dz=1.

At z=0.5: E=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*3.375 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.0125 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)≈1.309.

At z=1: E≈1.761.

So, the integral ≈ (1/2)[E(0) + 2*E(0.5) + E(1)]*(1-0)

≈ (1/2)[1 + 2*1.309 + 1.761] ≈ (1/2)(1 + 2.618 + 1.761) ≈ (1/2)(5.379) ≈ 2.6895.

But in reality, this is a rough approximation. Maybe using more points would give a better estimate.

Alternatively, I can use the substitution u = 1 + z, so u from 1 to 2.

Alternatively, look up the standard value.

But for the purposes of this thought process, let's accept that the comoving distance at z=7 is about 7 Gpc, given the higher H0 and cosmological parameters.

Wait, actually, in standard cosmology tables, at z=6-7, D_c is about 6-7 Gpc, but the exact value depends on the parameters.

But given that the answer is 9 Gpc, perhaps the redshift is higher, like z=8 or 9.

Wait, let's see.

If the rest-frame peak is at 100 nm, then observed at 790 nm, (1 + z)=7.9, z≈6.9.

At z=6.9, using the cosmology parameters.

Let me look up an approximate value.

I remember that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=6.5 is roughly 6 Gpc, and at z=7, it's about 7 Gpc.

But 9 Gpc would be at a higher z, maybe z=8 or 9.

Wait, let's compute for z=8.

E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(9)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*729 +0.7)=sqrt(218.7 + 0.7)=sqrt(219.4)≈14.82.

So, the integral from z=0 to z=8 of 1/E(z) dz.

Again, approximate.

At z=0: E=1.

At z=1: E≈1.761.

At z=2: E=sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)≈2.966.

At z=3: E=sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)≈4.465.

At z=4: E=sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)=sqrt(37.5 + 0.7)=sqrt(38.2)≈6.185.

At z=5: E=sqrt(0.3*216 +0.7)=sqrt(64.8 +0.7)=sqrt(65.5)≈8.099.

At z=6: E=sqrt(0.3*343 +0.7)=sqrt(102.9 +0.7)=sqrt(103.6)≈10.18.

At z=7: E=sqrt(0.3*512 +0.7)=sqrt(153.6 +0.7)=sqrt(154.3)≈12.42.

At z=8: E≈14.82.

So, the integral from z=0 to z=8 would involve integrating 1/E(z) from z=0 to z=8.

To approximate, use the trapezoidal rule with steps at each integer z.

So, the integral ≈ (1/2)*(E(0) + 2*(E(1)+E(2)+E(3)+E(4)+E(5)+E(6)+E(7)) + E(8)) * Δz

Δz=1 for each step.

So, E(0)=1, E(1)=1.761, E(2)=2.966, E(3)=4.465, E(4)=6.185, E(5)=8.099, E(6)=10.18, E(7)=12.42, E(8)=14.82.

So, summing them up:

E(0) =1

E(1)=1.761

E(2)=2.966

E(3)=4.465

E(4)=6.185

E(5)=8.099

E(6)=10.18

E(7)=12.42

E(8)=14.82

Total sum =1 +1.761 +2.966 +4.465 +6.185 +8.099 +10.18 +12.42 +14.82

Let me add step by step:

1 +1.761=2.761

+2.966=5.727

+4.465=10.192

+6.185=16.377

+8.099=24.476

+10.18=34.656

+12.42=47.076

+14.82=61.896.

So total sum ≈61.896.

Multiply by (1/2)*Δz=1: ≈30.948.

So, the integral ≈30.948.

Then, D_c = (1/H0) * ∫ dz/E(z) = (1/70 km/s/Mpc) * 30.948 * (1 Mpc / 1 Mpc).

But wait, H0 is in km/s/Mpc, so 1/H0 is in s/Mpc.

But D_c is in Mpc, so:

D_c = (30.948) * (1 / H0) Mpc.

But H0=70 km/s/Mpc, so 1/H0=1/(70 km/s/Mpc)= (1/70) Mpc/(km/s).

Wait, that can't be right because units don't match. Wait, I think I need to convert H0 to s^-1.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc=70e3 m/(s*Mpc).

So, 1/H0=1/(70e3 m/(s*Mpc))= (1/70e3) s/m * Mpc.

Wait, D_c is in Mpc, so:

D_c = ∫ dz/E(z) * (1/H0) = 30.948 * (1 / (70e3 m/s/Mpc)) Mpc.

But 1/m * Mpc = Mpc/m.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, use H0 in units of 1/s.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc=70e3 m/(s*Mpc).

So, 1/H0=1/(70e3) s/(Mpc). So, D_c = ∫(0 to z) dz/E(z) * (1/H0) = ∫... * (1/H0) in units of Mpc.

Wait, let's compute it numerically.

D_c = 30.948 * (1 / (70e3 m/(s*Mpc))) Mpc.

But 1/(70e3 m/(s*Mpc))= (1/70e3) s/(Mpc) * Mpc/m = (1/70e3) s/m.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm messing up the units. Let me try again.

The Hubble parameter H0 has units of 1/s (because it's a rate).

So H0 =70 km/s/Mpc =70e3 m/(s*Mpc).

Thus, 1/H0 is s/(70e3 m/Mpc) = s/(70e3 m/Mpc).

But D_c has units of Mpc, so when we compute D_c = (1/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz/E(z), it's (s/(70e3 m/Mpc)) * ∫(dz/E(z)).

Wait, units don't match.

I think it's better to convert H0 to s^-1.

H0 =70 km/s/Mpc=70e3 m/(s*Mpc).

So, H0 =70e3 m/(s*Mpc). So, 1/H0=1/(70e3 m/(s*Mpc))= (1/70e3) s/(m) * Mpc/m= (1/70e3) s/(m^2).

Wait, no, perhaps better to convert H0 to s^-1 in natural units.

Wait, perhaps I can use H0 in units of 1/s, so:

H0 = 2.2e17 s^-1 (because 70 km/s/Mpc =70e3 m/s/Mpc; 1 pc=3.0857e16 m, so 1 Mpc=3.0857e22 m.

Wait, actually:

H0 in s^-1 is H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc / (3.086e16 m/pc * 1e3 pc/Mpc) = wait, let me compute.

Wait, 1 Mpc=1e3 pc, and 1 pc=3.086e16 m.

So, 1 Mpc=3.086e19 m.

So, H0 in m/s/Mpc is 70 km/s/Mpc=70e3 m/s/Mpc.

Therefore, H0 in s^-1 is (70e3 m/s/Mpc) / (3.086e19 m) )= 70e3 / 3.086e19 ≈ 2.27e-16 s^-1.

So, 1/H0 ≈ 4.4e15 s.

Wait, then D_c is (1/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz/E(z) ≈4.4e15 s *30.948≈ 1.35e17 light-seconds.

But 1 light-year ≈ 9.46e15 m, 1 Mpc≈3.086e22 m.

So, 1 light-second=3.0e8 m/s *1 s=3e8 m.

So, 1.35e17 light-seconds=1.35e17 *3e8 m=4.05e25 m.

Convert to Mpc: 1 Mpc=3.086e22 m.

So, D_c=4.05e25 /3.086e22≈131 Mpc.

But that's still only 131 Mpc, not 9 Gpc.

Wait, something is wrong. I think I messed up the integral.

Wait, no, actually, I approximated the integral as 30.948, but that was only for z=0 to z=8 with a step of 1, which gives a very rough estimate.

In reality, the integral from z=0 to z=8 needs to be computed more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation formula.

I remember that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance can be approximated using the function:

D_c(z) ≈ (c/H0) * (2.2 / Ω_m^{3/2} (1 + z))^2) * F(z),

where F(z) is an integral that accounts for the dark energy effect.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator for comoving distance.

But since I can't access that, let me try to think differently.

Wait, the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is 790e-9 meters.

If we assume that the peak is at rest frame 100 nm, then z≈7.9.

But quasars often have their rest-frame emission peaks around 100-150 nm, so 100 nm is reasonable.

Thus, z≈7.9.

Now, in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=7.9.

I think that using the approximation formula for comoving distance:

D_c = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z')

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ)

We can use the approximation from the paper or standard formula.

Alternatively, use the look-up table.

But since I can't, let me recall that for Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=7 is roughly 7 Gpc.

At z=7.9, it would be a bit higher.

But the answer is 9 Gpc, so perhaps the redshift is higher.

Wait, maybe the rest-frame peak is even shorter. If I assume rest-frame peak is 60 nm, then (1+z)=790/60≈13.17, so z≈12.17.

But that's too high, and comoving distance would be way larger.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way. The peak is at rest-frame 100 nm, so z=7.9, which is D_c≈7-8 Gpc.

But the answer is 9 Gpc, so perhaps the rest-frame peak is at a longer wavelength.

Wait, if the rest-frame peak is 300 nm, then z=(790/300)-1≈2.63, so z≈1.63.

At z=1.63, comoving distance is about 3 Gpc.

But that doesn't match 9 Gpc.

Wait, maybe I have this backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not at the rest-frame UV, but in the observed near-IR is the rest-frame peak.

Wait, if the peak is at rest-frame 790 nm, that would mean the quasar hasn't redshifted, which is unlikely because quasars are at high z.

So, no, the rest-frame peak is shorter.

Thus, the quasar is at z≈7.9, which should give D_c≈7-8 Gpc.

But the answer is 9 Gpc, so perhaps I need to get a more accurate integral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation formula from the paper.

I recall that in the case of Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance can be approximated by:

D_c(z) ≈ (2.2/c) * (1 + z)^2 / sqrt(Ω_m(1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the function from the paper: D_c(z) = (c/H0) * (2.2 / Ω_m^{3/2} (1 + z))^2 * [1 + 0.5*Ω_Λ*(1 + z)]

But I think that's not accurate.

Alternatively, using the approximation for comoving distance in dark energy dominated universe.

But even so, perhaps I need to use the exact integral.

Wait, another approach: for a given z, compute the value of the integral ∫(0 to z) dz/E(z).

Given that E(z)=sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So, with z=7.9, compute ∫(0 to7.9) dz/E(z).

This is a definite integral that's difficult to compute without numerical methods.

But perhaps we can use the approximation for the integral of 1/E(z) from 0 to z.

For high z, when Ω_Λ becomes significant, dark energy starts to dominate, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_Λ) ≈0.8367.

But at z=7.9, Ω_m(1+z)^3=0.3*(8.9)^3≈0.3*681.5≈204.5, which is higher than Ω_Λ=0.7, so matter still dominates.

Wait, but as z increases, matter density decreases, and dark energy dominates at lower z.

Wait, no, higher z means higher (1+z), so higher matter density.

Wait, actually, the opposite: higher z means earlier universe, where matter was more dense, but dark energy starts to dominate at lower z, say z<1.

So, for z=7.9, matter is still dominant, so E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7).

Thus, the integral is dominated by the matter term.

So, for high z, ∫ dz/E(z)=∫ dz/sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7).

But I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can use substitution u=1+z.

Then, integral becomes ∫(1 to 8.9) du/sqrt(0.3 u^3 +0.7).

This is a standard integral, but it's not solvable in elementary functions.

Alternatively, use the substitution t=u^3, but not helpful.

Alternatively, use series expansion.

Let me try to compute ∫ du/sqrt(0.3 u^3 +0.7) from u=1 to u=8.9.

Let me factor out sqrt(0.7):

∫ du/(sqrt(0.7 +0.3 u^3)).

Let me write it as ∫ du/(sqrt(0.7 (1 + (0.3/0.7)u^3))).

Let me define k=(0.3/0.7)^(1/3)= (3/7)^(1/3)≈0.747.

So, the integral becomes ∫ du/(sqrt(0.7) sqrt(1 +k u^3)).

So, ∫ du/(sqrt(0.7) sqrt(1 +k u^3)) = 1/sqrt(0.7) * ∫ du/sqrt(1 +k u^3).

This integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or approximated numerically.

Alternatively, expand the denominator as a binomial series.

For large u, sqrt(1 +k u^3) ≈k^{1/2} u^{3/2} (1 + 1/(2k u^3) + ...).

But integrating term by term:

∫ du/sqrt(1 +k u^3)= ∫ du/(u^{3/2} sqrt(k + 1/u^3)) ) ≈ ∫ u^{-3/2} du * [1 - 1/(2k u^3) + ...].

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, using substitution t=u^3, then dt=3u^2 du, so du=dt/(3u^2)=dt/(3 t^{2/3}).

Thus, the integral becomes:

∫ dt/(3 t^{2/3} sqrt(0.7 +0.3 t)).

So ∫ dt/(3 t^{2/3} sqrt(0.7 +0.3 t)).

Again, not helpful.

Alternatively, use the substitution y=1 +k u^3, then dy=3k u^2 du.

But again, not helpful.

I think the only way is to use numerical approximation.

Let me use the trapezoidal rule with more points for the integral from u=1 to u=8.9.

Compute the function f(u)=1/sqrt(0.3 u^3 +0.7) at various points:

At u=1: f=1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1/1=1.

u=2: f=1/sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)≈1.761.

u=3: f=1/sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)≈2.966.

u=4: f=1/sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)≈4.465.

u=5: f=1/sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)=sqrt(37.5 +0.7)=sqrt(38.2)≈6.185.

u=6: f=1/sqrt(0.3*216 +0.7)=sqrt(64.8 +0.7)=sqrt(65.5)≈8.099.

u=7: f=1/sqrt(0.3*343 +0.7)=sqrt(102.9 +0.7)=sqrt(103.6)≈10.18.

u=8: f=1/s
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak wavelength is around 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. The question is asking about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model. They mention the Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, the matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy is 0.7, and the universe is flat. They also hint that the correct answer is 9 Gpc, but I need to figure out why.

Okay, let me start by recalling what I know. A quasar emitting light at a certain wavelength will have that light stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength because of the redshift. So, if we can figure out the redshift of the quasar, we can use that to find the distance.

The peak wavelength is 790 nm. I think in the near infrared or optical, but 790 is just a bit longer than visible light, since visible is about 400-700 nm. So, maybe the quasar is in the optical or just into near infrared.

Now, the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which might imply that there's a cutoff or a redshift. Because if the light is redshifted, shorter wavelengths (bluer) could correspond to higher energy or higher frequency parts of the spectrum, but maybe if the peak is at 790 nm, the drop-off suggests that beyond that, the flux doesn't increase as much, perhaps due to the atmosphere or instrumental reasons, but more likely due to the nature of the quasar's emission.

But maybe the peak is due to emission features, so if the quasar emits this peak, and we observe it at 790 nm, perhaps that's the rest wavelength? Wait, no, because if the universe is expanding, the observed wavelength would be longer. So, 790 nm observed would be due to a higher wavelength emitted. Hmm, but that seems conflicting with the idea of a peak. Alternatively, perhaps 790 nm is the rest wavelength, but due to redshift, it's stretched. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths. That could be due to intergalactic medium affecting the light, but more likely, since the peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's the rest frame wavelength. So, if the rest wavelength is 790 nm, and we observe it at a longer wavelength, that would be due to redshift. So, let me write that down:

If the rest wavelength λ_emitted = 790 nm, then the observed wavelength λ_observed is stretched by (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But actually, wait, the observed wavelength is 790 nm? Or is that the emitted wavelength? The question says: "a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm", but it doesn't specify whether that's rest frame or observed. Hmm.

Wait, in the context of the question, when they say "observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum", if the quasar is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelengths would be longer than the rest frame. So, if the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, then the rest frame wavelength would be shorter. Alternatively, if 790 nm is the rest frame wavelength, then the observed wavelength would be longer. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

But let's look at the answer given: 9 Gpc. Comoving distance for a quasar at redshift z can be calculated. So, maybe the reasoning is that the redshift z is such that the comoving distance is 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's light is observed at a certain wavelength, which allows us to compute the distance via the relativistic Doppler effect or distance measures in cosmology.

Given the parameters of the universe: H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, and flat universe (Ω_total = 1). So, the curvature is zero, so the model is flat.

So, to compute the comoving distance, which is the integral over the line of sight comoving distance, which in a flat universe is given by:

DC = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ (1 + z')^0)] dz'

Wait, hold on, I might be mixing up the integral. Actually, the comoving distance is given by:

DC = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z')

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ (1 + z)^0) since for dark energy, the influence is just (1 + z)^0, because the dark energy dominated era is at higher redshifts.

Wait, actually, E(z) is defined as:

E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ (1 + z)^0)

Wait, no, actually, in the standard notation, for a flat universe, E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Because Ω_Λ is a constant, so (1 + z)^0 = 1. So, E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

Wait, no, actually, E(z) is the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift. So, E(z) = H(z)/H0 = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

So, H(z) = H0 * E(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

So, the comoving distance DC is (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z').

So, DC = c / H0 * ∫(0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ)] dz'

So, if we can calculate that integral, we can find DC.

But the question is, how do we find z? The peak wavelength is given, but we need to figure out if it's the rest frame or observed frame.

Wait, the quasar's peak emission is at 790 nm. If this is in the rest frame, that would be the emitted wavelength. Alternatively, if it's observed, then it's stretched by (1 + z). So, we need to figure out which.

But the problem is, the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which is in the observed frame. So, the peak is at 790 nm observed, and below that, the flux drops. Wait, but that contradicts the idea of a quasar's emission. Quasars typically have broad emission lines, so the peak is due to some emission feature, perhaps the Lyman alpha forest or something else. But if at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) the flux drops, that might suggest that the peak is at 790 nm, and beyond that, it's dropping, but that doesn't make sense for emission.

Wait, no, hold on. If you have a quasar, which emits a broad spectrum, but due to intergalactic medium or other reasons, the flux drops at certain wavelengths, but more likely, the peak is in the rest frame.

Wait, maybe the peak is due to a specific emission line, which is redshifted. So, in the rest frame, the peak would be at a shorter wavelength.

So, for example, if the peak emission line is at a certain wavelength, say, 500 nm, and then due to redshift z, it's observed at 790 nm. Then, z can be calculated as (lambda_obs - lambda_rest)/(lambda_rest) = (790 - 500)/500 = 290 /500 = 0.58.

But we don't know the rest wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is at 790 nm in the rest frame, so the observed wavelength would be longer.

Wait, but if the quasar's emission is redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer than 790 nm. So, if the quasar is at high redshift, the peak is at longer wavelength.

But the question is, is 790 nm the observed or the rest wavelength? The problem statement says: "a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly."

So, in the observed spectrum, the peak is at 790 nm, and below that (shorter wavelengths), the flux drops. So, that suggests that at 790 nm, it's the peak, and as we go to bluer wavelengths, the flux decreases.

So, this is characteristic of a quasar's spectrum, which typically peaks around the rest UV/optical and then drops off at shorter wavelengths (the blue/UV drop). So, the peak is at rest frame around 100-200 nm, but in observed frame, due to redshift, it's longer.

Wait, no, actually, quasars have their peak emission in the optical or near UV in their rest frame, but when observed, due to redshift, this peak can shift into the near infrared or even further red.

But in this case, the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, so 790 nm is the peak.

Therefore, 790 nm is the observed wavelength for the peak emission. So, to find the rest wavelength, we need to know the redshift z.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, how do we get the redshift? Alternatively, perhaps 790 nm is the rest wavelength, but that doesn't fit with the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths.

Wait, no. If the quasar's rest frame peak is at 790 nm, then the observed wavelength would be λ = 790 * (1 + z). Since z is positive, λ_observed > λ_rest. So, if the rest frame peak is at, say, 500 nm, then (λ_obs = 790) gives z = (790 - 500)/500 = 0.58, same as before.

But we don't know the rest frame wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps 790 nm is the rest frame wavelength, but then the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which would imply that the rest frame has a peak at 790, and beyond that, the rest frame is lower, but in observed frame, it's even longer. But that doesn't fit with the observed flux drop.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of distance.

The comoving distance is given by DC = c / H0 * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ). So, with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70 * 1e3 m/s / 1e6 pc = 70 * 1e3 / 1e6 = 0.07 c.

But let me use H0 in terms of km/s/Mpc: H0 = 70, so DC = c / H0 * ∫(...)

But actually, let me note that the comoving distance in a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_Λ is a standard integral. There's a formula for the comoving distance for a flat ΛCDM universe.

I remember that in a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated, but I might need to compute it numerically.

Alternatively, if we can find the redshift z from the observed wavelength, then we can get DC.

Wait, but we don't know the rest wavelength, unless the 790 nm is the rest wavelength.

Wait, the question is, if 790 nm is the observed peak, then the rest wavelength is less, so 790 / (1 + z). But we don't have information about the rest wavelength.

Alternatively, if 790 nm is the rest wavelength, then the observed wavelength is 790 * (1 + z). Then, z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

But without knowing λ_rest, we can't find z.

Wait, but if the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that might imply that the peak is at 790 nm, and in the rest frame, that corresponds to some feature. But without knowing the rest wavelength, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's peak is at the rest wavelength of 790 nm, so z can be calculated from observed features. Wait, but we don't have any specific lines given.

Wait, maybe we can think in terms of the quasar's redshift. If the quasar's light is observed at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, and given that the universe's expansion affects the wavelength, then the redshift z can be estimated.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, this is tricky. Maybe the peak is at a certain rest wavelength that we can infer.

Wait, maybe the quasar is being observed in the near infrared because it's redshifted. So, if the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm (green light), then z = (790 - 500)/500 = (290)/500 = 0.58. Then, the redshift is about 0.58.

But 0.58 is a possible redshift. Let me see what the comoving distance would be for z = 0.58 in a flat ΛCDM universe with H0 = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7.

Wait, so I need to compute DC = c / H0 * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

But computing that integral numerically is perhaps needed here. Alternatively, there might be an approximation formula.

Wait, I remember that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated by:

DC ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2 / Ω_m^(3/2)) ) * ( (1 + z)^(1/2) - 1 ) ) + (1 / (1 + z)^(1/2)) * ln( (1 + z) * sqrt(Ω_m) + sqrt(Ω_Λ)) ) ]

Wait, maybe not exactly, but I think there are some standard approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps use an online calculator or table for comoving distance in ΛCDM.

Wait, but since I can't access that right now, let me think about how to compute it step by step.

So, the integral is:

DC = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) 1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ) dz'

Let me change variable to x = 1 + z', so z' = x - 1, dz' = dx.

Then, the integral becomes:

DC = (c / H0) * ∫(1 to 1 + z) 1 / sqrt(Ω_m x^3 + Ω_Λ) dx

So, DC = (c / H0) * ∫(1 to 1 + z) 1 / sqrt(Ω_m x^3 + Ω_Λ) dx

Now, let me plug in the numbers:

Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, so E(x) = sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7)

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70 * 1e3 m/s / 1e6 pc = 0.07 c. So, c/H0 = 1 / 0.07 ≈ 14.2857 Mpc.

So, DC = 14.2857 Mpc * ∫(1 to 1 + z) 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx

Wait, but 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7). Let me make this dimensionless. Since x is 1 + z', which is from 1 to 1 + z.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out the 0.7.

Let me factor out 0.7 from the square root:

sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.7 (0.3/0.7 x^3 + 1)) = sqrt(0.7) * sqrt(0.42857 x^3 + 1)

So, 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) = 1 / (sqrt(0.7) * sqrt(0.42857 x^3 + 1)) = (1 / sqrt(0.7)) * 1 / sqrt(0.42857 x^3 + 1)

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the integral numerically for a given z.

But since we don't know z, maybe we can express the integral in terms of z. Alternatively, perhaps using an approximation.

Wait, I recall that for low redshifts (z << 1), the integral can be approximated, but for higher z, it gets more complicated.

Alternatively, since the integral is from 1 to 1 + z, and for z around 0.5 to 1, we can compute it numerically.

Alternatively, use the lookback time, but that's different.

Wait, perhaps I can try plugging in z = 0.5, to see what DC we get.

But, wait, let's think again: if the quasar's peak is at 790 nm, which is observed, and if we can find the rest wavelength, then we can get z. But since we don't know the rest wavelength, maybe the peak is due to the Lyman alpha forest or something else. Wait, but without knowing that, perhaps the question is assuming that the observed wavelength of 790 nm is the rest wavelength, so z = 0.

But that can't be, because then flux would not drop at shorter wavelengths.

Alternatively, maybe 790 nm is the rest wavelength, so the redshift is such that the observed wavelength is 790, so that would imply (1 + z) = λ_obs / λ_rest.

But since we don't know λ_rest, unless it's given as 790 nm. Wait, no, if λ_rest = 790 nm, then the observed wavelength would be longer, but in the question, the peak is at 790 nm observed, and flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which would correspond to higher frequencies, which is consistent with a higher redshift.

Wait, maybe the quasar's rest frame peak is at 790 nm, but due to redshift, the observed peak is at longer wavelength. But in this case, the peak is at 790 nm observed, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. So, perhaps λ_obs = 790 nm, which comes from a rest wavelength of λ_rest = 790 / (1 + z). But we don't know z.

Alternatively, maybe this is a standard quasar, whose rest frame emission is known. But without knowing the rest wavelength, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, in the observed frame, that suggests that the quasar is at a certain redshift. The quasar's spectrum is dropping at shorter wavelengths, which in the rest frame would correspond to higher frequencies, but in observed frame, it's lower.

Wait, no, if the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that would imply that the source is dimming at higher frequencies, which is inconsistent with standard quasar spectra which peak in blue/UV. Wait, but actually, in quasars, the flux does drop at shorter wavelengths (the "blue/UV drop"), which is due to the quasar's rest frame spectrum. So, the peak is at a certain rest wavelength, which when observed, is redshifted.

So, in the rest frame, the quasar has a peak at, say, 100 nm, but due to redshift, the peak is observed at 790 nm. Therefore, 790 nm = 100 nm * (1 + z). So, z = (790 / 100) - 1 = 6.9. Wait, but z = 6.9 is quite high. Then, the comoving distance would be very large.

But if z = 6.9, using comoving distance formula:

DC = 14.2857 Mpc * ∫(1 to 7.9) 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx

Which would be a very large distance, perhaps tens of Gpc.

But the answer is 9 Gpc, which is about 9,000 Mpc.

Wait, 14.2857 Mpc is about 14.2857 Mpc, so 14.2857 * 600 ≈ 8547 Mpc, which is about 8.5 Gpc. Hmm, close to 9 Gpc.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because if λ_rest is 100 nm, then z = 6.9, but quasars at z=6.9 would have their light pollution at 100 nm, which is ionizing, but such high redshift quasars are very rare.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest wavelength is longer. Suppose the rest wavelength is 500 nm, then z = (790 - 500)/500 = 0.58, as I thought before.

So, z = 0.58.

Then, compute DC.

So, DC = 14.2857 Mpc * ∫(1 to 1.58) 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx

So, let's compute the integral from x=1 to x=1.58.

First, compute the integrand at various points:

At x=1: sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) = 1, so integrand is 1.

At x=1.58: sqrt(0.3*(1.58)^3 + 0.7)

Compute 1.58^3: 1.58 * 1.58 = 2.4964, then 2.4964 * 1.58 ≈ 3.944.

Then, 0.3*3.944 ≈ 1.183, so sqrt(1.183 + 0.7) = sqrt(1.883) ≈ 1.372.

So, the integrand at x=1.58 is 1 / 1.372 ≈ 0.729.

So, the integrand decreases from 1 to ~0.729 as x goes from 1 to 1.58.

So, let's approximate the integral. The integral of 1/x from 1 to 1.58 is ln(1.58) ≈ 0.457, but since the integrand isn't 1/x, it's 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7).

We can try to approximate the integral numerically.

Alternatively, use the trapezoidal rule with a few points.

At x=1: f=1.

At x=1.2: compute sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 + 0.7). 1.2^3=1.728, 0.3*1.728=0.5184, so sqrt(0.5184 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.2184)=1.1036, so f=1/1.1036≈0.906.

At x=1.4: 1.4^3=2.744, 0.3*2.744=0.8232, sqrt(0.8232 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.5232)=1.234, so f≈0.811.

At x=1.58: f≈0.729 as above.

So, the function decreases from 1 at x=1 to 0.729 at x=1.58.

We can use the trapezoidal rule with these three points.

The trapezoidal rule for three points is:

Integral ≈ (Δx / 2) [f1 + 2f2 + f3]

Where Δx = 1.58 - 1 = 0.58.

So:

≈ (0.58 / 2) [1 + 2*(0.906) + 0.729]

Compute:

0.58 / 2 = 0.29

Inside the brackets: 1 + 1.812 + 0.729 = 1 + 1.812 = 2.812 + 0.729 = 3.541

So, 0.29 * 3.541 ≈ 1.026

So, the integral is approximately 1.026.

Therefore, DC ≈ 14.2857 Mpc * 1.026 ≈ 14.63 Mpc.

Wait, that's only about 14.6 Mpc, which is about 0.0146 Gpc, which is way less than 9 Gpc.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I did the integral wrong. Because actually, the integral is:

∫(1 to 1.58) dx / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7)

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I had x = 1 + z', so dz' = dx, but E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ), so at z' = x -1, E(z') = sqrt(Ω_m x^3 + Ω_Λ). So, yes, the integrand is 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7).

But when I tried to compute it from x=1 to x=1.58, I got about 1.026, which seems low, but given that E(x) is increasing, so 1 / sqrt(...) is decreasing.

Wait, but 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) at x=1 is 1, and at x=1.58 is about 0.729. So, the function is decreasing from 1 to ~0.729.

Therefore, the integral should be less than 0.58 (the width) times 1, but it's 1.026, which is more than the width, implying the function is above 1 on average, which is not possible since it starts at 1 and goes down. Therefore, my approximation must be wrong.

Wait, no, actually, when using the trapezoidal rule with points at x=1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.58, the function is 1, 0.906, 0.811, 0.729.

So, the trapezoidal rule with these points should give a better approximation.

But wait, the actual integral is less than (1.58 - 1) * 1 = 0.58, but with the function sometimes above 1? No, the function is always less than or equal to 1, since 1 / sqrt(...) is <=1.

Wait, but when I did the trapezoidal rule:

Integral ≈ (0.58 / 2) [1 + 2*(0.906) + 0.729] ≈ (0.29) [1 + 1.812 + 0.729] ≈ 0.29 * 3.541 ≈ 1.026.

But since the function is always less than or equal to 1, the integral cannot be more than 0.58. Therefore, my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the trapezoidal rule. Wait, the trapezoidal rule formula is:

Integral ≈ (Δx / 2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + 2f(xn-1) + f(xn)]

In this case, with three points (x0=1, x1=1.2, x2=1.4, x3=1.58), wait no, I only have three points, so n=3 intervals.

Wait, actually, for four points (x0=1, x1=1.2, x2=1.4, x3=1.58), the trapezoidal rule would be:

Integral ≈ (Δx / 2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + f(x3)]

Where Δx = 0.58.

So, plugging in:

≈ (0.58 / 2) [1 + 2*0.906 + 2*0.811 + 0.729]

Compute:

0.58 / 2 = 0.29

Inside the brackets: 1 + 1.812 + 1.622 + 0.729 = 1 + 1.812 = 2.812 + 1.622 = 4.434 + 0.729 = 5.163

So, 0.29 * 5.163 ≈ 1.498

So, the integral ≈ 1.498.

Therefore, DC ≈ 14.2857 Mpc * 1.498 ≈ 21.43 Mpc

So, about 21.43 Mpc, which is still only ~0.021 Gpc.

Wait, but 9 Gpc is way larger. So, perhaps my assumption that z=0.58 is incorrect.

Wait, so maybe 790 nm is the rest wavelength, and z is such that λ_obs = 790 nm.

Wait, but if 790 nm is the rest wavelength, then z = (790 - λ_rest)/λ_rest. But without knowing λ_rest, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, suppose that the quasar is at a redshift where 1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest.

But since we don't know λ_rest, unless the quasar's rest frame has a certain feature.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the Lyman limit or something else. Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, but 790 nm is much longer. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at z=2, which gives 1 + z=3, so λ_obs = λ_rest * 3.

So, λ_rest = 790 / 3 ≈ 263 nm.

But 263 nm is in the far UV. So, if the quasar's rest frame peak is at 263 nm, observed at 790 nm, that gives z=2.

Then, compute the comoving distance.

So, z=2.

Compute DC = 14.2857 Mpc * ∫(1 to 3) 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx

Again, let's compute the integral numerically.

We need to compute ∫(1 to3) 1 / sqrt(0.3x^3 + 0.7) dx.

Let me compute f(x) at several points:

x=1: f=1 / sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=1

x=1.5: 1.5^3=3.375, 0.3*3.375=1.0125, sqrt(1.0125 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=1.309, so f≈0.765

x=2: 8, 0.3*8=2.4, sqrt(2.4 + 0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.761, so f≈0.568

x=2.5: 15.625, 0.3*15.625=4.6875, sqrt(4.6875 + 0.7)=sqrt(5.3875)=2.321, so f≈0.430

x=3: 27, 0.3*27=8.1, sqrt(8.1 + 0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966, so f≈0.337

So, f(x) decreases from 1 at x=1 to 0.337 at x=3.

To approximate the integral, let's use the trapezoidal rule with intervals at x=1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.

So, Δx=0.5 each.

Compute:

Integral ≈ (Δx / 2) [f1 + 2f2 + 2f3 + 2f4 + f5]

Wait, no, for 5 points (x=1,1.5,2,2.5,3), the trapezoidal rule is:

≈ (0.5 / 2) [f(1) + 2f(1.5) + 2f(2) + 2f(2.5) + f(3)]

So, 0.25 [1 + 2*0.765 + 2*0.568 + 2*0.430 + 0.337]

Compute:

0.25 [1 + 1.53 + 1.136 + 0.860 + 0.337] = 0.25 [1 + 1.53 = 2.53 + 1.136 = 3.666 + 0.860 = 4.526 + 0.337 = 4.863]

So, 0.25 * 4.863 ≈ 1.2158

Therefore, integral ≈1.216.

So, DC ≈14.2857 * 1.216 ≈17.37 Mpc, which is about 0.017 Gpc. Still nowhere near 9 Gpc.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the quasar is at a higher redshift.

Wait, perhaps the rest wavelength is 500 nm, as I thought earlier, so z=(790 -500)/500=0.58.

But then, the comoving distance is about 21 Mpc, which is not 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the fact that the peak is at 790 nm observed, but in reality, the quasar is at a higher redshift, so that the rest frame is 790*(1 + z). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if 790 nm is the observed wavelength, then the rest wavelength is shorter: λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + z).

But without knowing λ_rest, we can't find z.

Alternatively, if 790 nm is the rest wavelength, then observed wavelength is longer: λ_obs = λ_rest*(1 + z). So, if 790 nm is rest, then λ_obs = 790*(1 + z).

But then, the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which are higher frequencies, so z must be positive, so λ_obs > λ_rest.

But without knowing λ_rest, how can we find z?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the quasar's rest frame peak is at 1 micron (1000 nm), and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, so it's redshifted, which gives z=(790 -1000)/1000= -0.21, which is negative, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at a distance where the expansion has redshifted the light to near infrared, but without specific features, it's hard to find z.

Wait, but the answer is 9 Gpc, so perhaps the reasoning is a bit different.

Wait, maybe the 790 nm is the observed wavelength, and the quasar is at a high enough redshift that the comoving distance is 9 Gpc.

So, let's reverse-engineer.

Given that DC =9 Gpc =9,000 Mpc.

So, DC = c / H0 * ∫(...)

So, c / H0 = 14.2857 Mpc as before.

So, 14.2857 * ∫(...) =9,000.

So, ∫(...) =9,000 /14.2857 ≈ 630.

So, the integral of 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx from 1 to 1 + z needs to be approximately 630.

Wait, but wait, 9,000 Mpc is 9 Gpc, which is 9,000 Mpc, but 14.2857 Mpc * 630 ≈9,000.

But ∫(1 to1 + z) 1 / sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) dx ≈630

But the integral is ∫(...,x), so it's a function that increases with x.

Wait, but sqrt(0.3 x^3 + 0.7) increases with x, so 1 / sqrt(...) decreases with x. So, the integral from 1 to 1 + z would be less than (1 + z -1)*1= z.

But 630 is much larger than 1, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So, I think I messed up the units.

Wait, because H0 is in km/s/Mpc, c is in m/s, so c / H0 is in (m/s
[overthinking]
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth is 9 gigaparsecs (Gpc). The problem gives some information about the quasar's spectrum and asks about the comoving distance in a Lambda-CDM universe. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what a quasar is. Quasars are extremely bright and distant objects that emit a lot of energy. They are powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of active galaxies. The problem mentions that observations in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak around 790 nm and a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I think this is related to the rest-frame properties of the quasar, but I need to connect this to the distance.

Now, the universe is modeled by the Lambda-CDM theory, which includes dark matter, dark energy, and normal matter. The parameters given are the Hubble constant (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc), the matter density parameter (Ω_m = 0.3), dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ = 0.7), and the universe is flat (Ω_total = Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1). So, it's a flat Λ-CDM model, which is the standard model for cosmology.

The question is about the comoving distance (DCoM) of the quasar from Earth. Comoving distance is the distance that would be light-years if we were in the same galaxy, but since we can't travel faster than light, it's the distance we would measure today. The formula for comoving distance is an integral over redshift, but it's often approximated or looked up for specific redshifts or z.

Wait, the problem doesn't give a redshift. It just gives the wavelength peak. How do we get the redshift from the wavelength? I remember that the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the redshift formula: λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z). So if we can find the emitted wavelength, we can compute the redshift z, and then use that to find the comoving distance.

The peak wavelength is given as 790 nm. If this is the rest-frame (i.e., emitted) wavelength, then in our observed frame, it's stretched by (1 + z). But wait, in the near-infrared, the peak is at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths (<790 nm), the flux drops. That sounds like a typical quasar spectrum where the peak is in the rest-frame UV/optical, and due to redshift, it shifts into the optical or near-infrared for us.

So, maybe 790 nm is the observed wavelength, not the rest-frame. But the problem says "peak at wavelength of about 790 nm," and that at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops. That suggests that the peak is at 790 nm, and the rest of the spectrum (at shorter wavelengths) is dimmer. So, if 790 nm is the observed peak, then the rest-frame peak is at a shorter wavelength.

Wait, but we can't observe shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, as the flux drops. Alternatively, perhaps 790 nm is the rest-frame wavelength. Hmm, I need to clarify.

If 790 nm is the rest-frame peak, then in our observed frame, it would be λ = 790 nm / (1 + z). But since the flux drops at shorter wavelengths (which would be bluer, hence higher frequencies), that suggests that the quasar's rest-frame peak is in the optical or UV, and as it is redshifted, it shifts into the near-infrared. So, if the rest-frame peak is, say, around 300-400 nm (which is UV), then for a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 790 nm.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest-frame spectrum is such that the peak is in the rest-frame near-infrared, but that seems less likely because quasars typically have peaks in the rest-frame UV/optical.

Wait, maybe we can use the peak wavelength to estimate the quasar's luminosity or its black hole mass, but the question is about the comoving distance. So, perhaps it's more straightforward. The comoving distance is a function of redshift, so if we can estimate the redshift, we can find the comoving distance.

But without a given redshift, how do we get z? Maybe the information about the spectrum can help us estimate z. The peak wavelength is 790 nm. If this is the rest-frame wavelength, then we can use the fact that for quasars, the emitted peak is around a certain wavelength, and the observed wavelength is stretched by (1 + z). Alternatively, if 790 nm is the observed wavelength, then we can compute the rest-frame wavelength as λ_rest = 790 / (1 + z).

But how does this help? Let's think about typical redshifts for quasars. The highest redshift quasars are around z ≈ 6-7, but most are lower. If the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, then a high z would shift the peak from UV to near-infrared.

For example, if z = 2, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So, if λ_rest is 300 nm (which is UV), then λ_obs = 300 * 3 = 900 nm. So, 900 nm is in the near-infrared. So, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is slightly less than 900, then the rest-frame λ is about 790 / 3 ≈ 263 nm, which is in the UV.

So, perhaps z ≈ 2. Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

If λ_obs = 790 nm, assuming it's the observed peak, then if we consider that the rest-frame peak is in UV, say around 300 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / 300 ≈ 2.633. So z ≈ 1.633.

Alternatively, if the rest-frame peak is longer, say 400 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / 400 ≈ 1.975, so z ≈ 0.975.

But without knowing the rest-frame peak, it's tricky. However, quasars typically have their rest-frame emission peaks around 100-300 nm, so 300 nm is a reasonable assumption.

Thus, if λ_rest ≈ 300 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / 300 ≈ 2.633, so z ≈ 1.633.

Now, with z ≈ 1.633, we can compute the comoving distance. The formula for comoving distance is:

DCoM = c * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / H0 * (1 + z')]^{-1} dz'

But in practice, we can use the approximation formula or look it up. I remember that comoving distance for a flat Λ-CDM universe can be approximated by:

DCoM ≈ (c / H0) * (1 + (1 - Ω_m)^0.5 * z) * something... Wait, maybe it's better to use the lookback time or find a table.

Wait, another approach: for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be calculated numerically. But for simplicity, sometimes people use the approximation for low z, but z=1.6 is not that low.

Alternatively, using the relation:

DCoM = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) [Ω_m(1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ]^(-1/2) dz'

Since Ω_Λ = 0.7, Ω_m = 0.3, and the universe is flat, so Ω_total = 1. So the integrand becomes [Ω_m(1 + z')^3 + (1 - Ω_m)]^(-1/2) = [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2)

To compute this integral numerically, we can use a calculator or approximate it.

Alternatively, I recall that for Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving distance at z=1.633 can be found using standard tables or calculators. But since I don't have a calculator, I can try to estimate.

First, let's compute the integral step by step.

The integral is from z=0 to z=1.633 of [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

Let me denote f(z) = [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2)

At z=0: f(0) = [0.3(1)^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) = (1.0)^(-1/2) = 1

At z=1: f(1) = [0.3(8) + 0.7]^(-1/2) = [2.4 + 0.7] = 3.1^(-1/2) ≈ 0.566

At z=2: f(2) = [0.3(27) + 0.7] = 8.1 + 0.7 = 8.8^(-1/2) ≈ 0.316

At z=1.633, let's compute f(1.633):

(1 + z') = 1 + 1.633 = 2.633

(1 + z')^3 = (2.633)^3 ≈ 2.633 * 2.633 = 6.927, then 6.927 * 2.633 ≈ 18.28

So 0.3 * 18.28 ≈ 5.484 + 0.7 = 6.184

Thus, f(1.633) = 6.184^(-1/2) ≈ 1 / 2.486 ≈ 0.402

So, f(z) decreases from 1 at z=0 to 0.402 at z=1.633.

The integral of f(z) from 0 to 1.633 is the area under the curve. Since f(z) is monotonically decreasing, we can approximate it using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

But perhaps it's better to use the approximate formula for the comoving distance in a flat Λ-CDM universe:

DCoM ≈ (c / H0) * f(z)

But actually, it's an integral, not a function. So, maybe we can use the approximation formula or look up a table.

Alternatively, I recall that for Ω_m = 0.3 and Ω_Λ = 0.7, the comoving distance at z=1.633 can be computed as follows.

I think the integral can be expressed in terms of the function:

I(z) = ∫0^z [Ω_m(1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ]^(-1/2) dz'

For Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, we can write:

I(z) = ∫0^z [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

To compute this, let me make a substitution: let u = 1 + z', then du = dz', and when z'=0, u=1, z'=1.633, u=2.633.

Thus,

I(z) = ∫1^2.633 [0.3 u^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) du

= ∫1^2.633 (0.3 u^3 + 0.7)^(-1/2) du

This integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, but it's probably easier to use numerical integration.

Alternatively, using the approximate formula:

For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

DCoM ≈ (c / H0) * [ (1 + z) - Ω_m * (1 + z) - Ω_Λ * (1 + z)^2 ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, using the lookback time function:

t_L(z) = ∫0^z [1 / H0 * E(z')]^{-1} dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1 + z)^3 + Ω_Λ)

But comoving distance is DCoM = c * ∫0^z [1 / E(z)] dz'

So, DCoM = c / H0 * ∫0^z [1 / E(z')]^{-1} dz'

Wait, no, H0 = c / (comoving distance unit). Wait, I think I need to clarify the units.

Actually, the comoving distance formula is:

DCoM = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [Ω_m(1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ]^(-1/2) dz'

Yes, that's correct. So, DCoM = (c / H0) * I(z)

So, with c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70 x 10^3 m/s/Mpc

But to get DCoM in Gpc, we can compute it as:

DCoM (Gpc) = (c / H0) * I(z) / (1e9 km / 1e9 pc)

Wait, let's make it step by step.

First, express H0 in s^-1:

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70 x 10^3 m/s / (1 Mpc)

But 1 Mpc = 1e6 pc, and 1 pc = 3.0857e16 meters.

So, H0 = 70e3 m/s / (1e6 pc * 3.0857e16 m/pc) = 70e3 / (3.0857e25) s^-1

≈ (7e4) / (3.0857e25) s^-1 ≈ 2.268e-22 s^-1

c = 3e8 m/s

So, c / H0 = 3e8 / 2.268e-22 ≈ 1.323e30 m / s * s = 1.323e30 m

But we need to convert this to Gpc.

1 Gpc = 1e9 pc = 1e9 * 3.0857e16 m ≈ 3.0857e25 m

So, DCoM (m) = (c / H0) * I(z) = 1.323e30 m * I(z)

But I(z) is dimensionless, so DCoM (m) = 1.323e30 * I(z) m

To get DCoM in Gpc, divide by 3.0857e25 m/Gpc:

DCoM (Gpc) ≈ (1.323e30 / 3.0857e25) * I(z) ≈ 4.3 * I(z)

So, DCoM ≈ 4.3 * I(z) Gpc

But I(z) is the integral from 0 to z of [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

So, we need to compute I(z=1.633) ≈ ∫0^1.633 [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

As we computed earlier, at z=1.633, 0.3(2.633)^3 + 0.7 ≈ 0.3*18.28 + 0.7 ≈ 5.484 + 0.7 ≈ 6.184, so f(z)=1/sqrt(6.184)≈0.402

But integrating from 0 to 1.633, how much is that? Let's approximate.

We can use the trapezoidal rule for the integral.

The function f(z') = [0.3(1 + z')^3 + 0.7]^(-1/2)

At z'=0: f(0)=1

At z'=1: f(1)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4 + 0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.761

Wait, no, f(z')=1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7). So at z'=0, f=1/sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1/1=1

At z'=1, f=1/sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=1/sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=1/sqrt(3.1)=~0.566

At z'=2, f=1/sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=1/sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=1/sqrt(8.8)=~0.316

At z'=1.633, f≈0.402

To approximate the integral ∫0^1.633 f(z') dz', we can use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.

Let me divide the range from 0 to 1.633 into, say, 4 intervals.

Each interval has dz'= (1.633)/4≈0.408

So, the points are z'=0, 0.408, 0.816, 1.224, 1.632

Compute f at these points:

At z'=0: f=1

z'=0.408: compute f=1/sqrt(0.3*(1.408)^3 +0.7)

(1.408)^3≈2.808

0.3*2.808≈0.842

0.842 +0.7=1.542

f=1/sqrt(1.542)=~0.811

z'=0.816: (1.816)^3≈5.947

0.3*5.947≈1.784

1.784 +0.7=2.484

f=1/sqrt(2.484)=~0.602

z'=1.224: (2.224)^3≈11.06

0.3*11.06≈3.318

3.318 +0.7=4.018

f=1/sqrt(4.018)=~0.497

z'=1.632: f≈0.402 (as before)

So, the trapezoidal rule with 4 intervals:

Integral ≈ (Δz'/2) [f(z0) + 2f(z1) + 2f(z2) + 2f(z3) + f(z4)]

Δz'=0.408

So,

≈ (0.408/2) [1 + 2*0.811 + 2*0.602 + 2*0.497 + 0.402]

Compute inside:

1 + 1.622 + 1.204 + 0.994 + 0.402 = 1 + 1.622=2.622; 2.622 +1.204=3.826; 3.826 +0.994=4.82; 4.82 +0.402=5.222

Multiply by 0.408/2=0.204

So, ≈ 0.204 *5.222≈1.066

So, I(z=1.633)≈1.066

Thus, DCoM≈4.3 *1.066≈4.587 Gpc

Wait, but the problem says the correct answer is 9 Gpc. Hmm, that's double what I got. Maybe my approximation was too crude with only 4 intervals. Let's try with more intervals for better accuracy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the look-up table for comoving distances in Λ-CDM.

I remember that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=2 is about 1.5 Gpc, but that seems low. Wait, no, actually, comoving distances are usually in Gpc, and for higher redshifts, they get larger.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the quasar's redshift is higher.

Wait, earlier I estimated z≈1.6 based on λ=790 nm. But if the rest-frame peak is in UV, around 300 nm, then z≈1.6. But perhaps we can get a better estimate.

Alternatively, maybe the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is near-infrared, and the rest-frame peak is in the rest-frame UV. So, suppose the rest-frame peak is λ_rest ≈ 300 nm (as a typical quasar), then (1 + z) = 790 / 300 ≈2.633 => z≈1.633.

Alternatively, if the rest-frame peak is in the near-infrared, say 1000 nm, then (1 + z)=790/1000=0.79, so z≈-0.21, which doesn't make sense. So the rest-frame peak must be shorter, in UV.

Thus, z≈1.633.

But let's check if I did the integral correctly. I think the integral from 0 to 1.633 of f(z') dz' is approximately 1.066, leading to DCoM≈4.3 *1.066≈4.59 Gpc. But the correct answer is 9 Gpc, which is almost double.

Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Wait, I have:

DCoM = (c / H0) * I(z)

But c=3e8 m/s, H0=70e3 m/s/Mpc=7e4 m/s/Mpc

So, c/H0= (3e8)/(7e4)= approx 4.285e3 Mpc

But 1 Gpc=1e3 Mpc, so 4.285e3 Mpc=4.285 Gpc.

Wait, that's important. So, DCoM in Gpc is (c/H0)*I(z)

c/H0=4.285 Gpc

Therefore, DCoM=4.285 * I(z)

Earlier, I did 4.3 * I(z), which is consistent.

But if I(z)=1.066, DCoM≈4.58 Gpc, which is close to 4.5 Gpc, but the answer is 9 Gpc. So, perhaps I need to consider that the redshift is higher.

Alternatively, maybe the peak wavelength is in the rest-frame, so λ_rest=790 nm, and then (1 + z)=λ_obs/λ_rest=790/790=1, so z=0, which is not the case.

Wait, no, that would mean no redshift, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, so it must have a redshift.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the rest-frame and observed-frame. Suppose the quasar's peak is at 790 nm in the rest-frame, then the observed wavelength is 790*(1 + z). But that would mean λ_obs > λ_rest, so redshifted. But the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which are blueshifted, so that can't be. So, the peak is at 790 nm in the rest-frame, but we observe it at longer wavelengths, which is not the case because we see the drop at shorter wavelengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the rest-frame, and we observe it redshifted. So, λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + z). So, if λ_rest=300 nm, then z=(790 -300)/300≈1.633.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So, I think z=1.633 is correct.

But then why is the comoving distance 9 Gpc? Maybe I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_Λ.

I recall that for Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance can be approximated by:

DCoM ≈ (c / H0) * [ 1 - Ω_m^0.5 - Ω_Λ^0.5 ]^{-1} * (1 + z)

But that's probably not accurate.

Alternatively, the lookback time function t_L(z) is ∫0^z [1 / H0 * E(z')]^{-1} dz', where E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ)

But I need the inverse, which is the comoving distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the online calculator or known values.

I remember that at z=1, comoving distance is approximately 1.78 Gpc for Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7.

At z=2, it's approximately 3.3 Gpc.

At z=1.633, which is roughly between 1.5 and 1.7, so maybe around 2.5 Gpc?

But the correct answer is 9 Gpc, which is way higher.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units for c and H0.

Wait, let's double-check.

c=3e8 m/s

H0=70 km/s/Mpc=70e3 m/s / (1 Mpc)=70e3 m/s / (1e6 pc * 3.0857e16 m/pc)=70e3 / (3.0857e25) s^-1

So, H0=70e3 / 3.0857e25 ≈ 2.268e-22 s^-1

Thus, c/H0= (3e8 m/s) / (2.268e-22 s^-1)=1.323e30 m

Convert to Mpc: 1 Mpc=3.0857e16 m

So, c/H0=1.323e30 /3.0857e16≈4.28e13 m / Mpc

But 1 Gpc=1e3 Mpc

So, 4.28e13 m / Mpc *1e3 Mpc/Gpc=4.28e16 m/Gpc

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, c/H0=1.323e30 m

1 Gpc=3.0857e25 m

So, c/H0 in Gpc=1.323e30 /3.0857e25≈4.285 Gpc

Yes, that's correct.

So, DCoM= (c/H0)*I(z)

I(z)=∫0^z [0.3(1 + z')^3 +0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

So, if I(z)=1.066, DCoM=4.285*1.066≈4.58 Gpc

But the correct answer is 9 Gpc. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the quasar's redshift is higher. Let's think again about the redshift.

If the rest-frame peak is at 300 nm, and the observed peak is at 790 nm, then z=(790 -300)/300=1.633, as before.

But maybe the rest-frame peak is at 450 nm? Then z=(790 -450)/450≈0.608

Then, I(z=0.608)=∫0^0.608 [0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7]^(-1/2) dz'

Compute f(z') at various points:

At z'=0: f=1

z'=0.608: (1 +0.608)=1.608

(1.608)^3≈4.177

0.3*4.177≈1.253 +0.7=1.953

f=1/sqrt(1.953)≈0.804

Compute I(z)≈ (Δz'/2)[f(z0)+2f(z1)+2f(z2)+...+f(zn)]

But with z=0.608, let's take a few points:

z'=0: f=1

z'=0.304: midpoint

(1 +0.304)=1.304

(1.304)^3≈2.228

0.3*2.228≈0.668 +0.7=1.368

f=1/sqrt(1.368)=~0.869

z'=0.608: f≈0.804

So, using trapezoidal rule with 3 intervals:

Δz'=0.304

Integral≈(0.304/2)[1 + 2*0.869 +0.804]

≈0.152 [1 +1.738 +0.804]=0.152*(3.542)=0.540

Thus, I(z=0.608)=≈0.540

Thus, DCoM=4.285 *0.540≈2.32 Gpc

Still not 9 Gpc.

Wait, perhaps the rest-frame peak is at a longer wavelength? Let's say λ_rest=500 nm.

Then, (1 + z)=790/500=1.58, so z≈0.58

Compute I(z=0.58):

(1 +0.58)=1.58

(1.58)^3≈3.944

0.3*3.944≈1.183 +0.7=1.883

f(z)=1/sqrt(1.883)=~0.815

Compute I(z)=∫0^0.58 f(z') dz'

Take a few points:

z'=0: f=1

z'=0.29: (1.29)^3≈2.14

0.3*2.14≈0.642 +0.7=1.342

f=1/sqrt(1.342)=~0.873

z'=0.58: f≈0.815

Using trapezoidal rule with 2 intervals:

Δz'=0.29

Integral≈(0.29/2)[1 + 2*0.873 +0.815]

≈0.145 [1 +1.746 +0.815]=0.145*3.561≈0.517

Thus, I(z)=0.517

DCoM=4.285 *0.517≈2.21 Gpc

Still not 9 Gpc.

Wait, maybe the rest-frame peak is at 200 nm? Then (1 + z)=790/200=3.95, so z≈2.95

Compute I(z=2.95):

(1 + z)=3.95

(3.95)^3≈61.18

0.3*61.18≈18.35 +0.7=19.05

f(z)=1/sqrt(19.05)=~0.351

Compute I(z)=∫0^2.95 f(z') dz'

Let's approximate with a few intervals.

z'=0: f=1

z'=1: f≈0.566 (from earlier)

z'=2: f≈0.316

z'=2.95: f≈0.351

Using Simpson's rule for better accuracy. Simpson's rule for n=4 (even number of intervals).

Wait, z=0 to 2.95, let's divide into 4 intervals:

z'=0, 0.7375,1.475,2.2125,2.95

Compute f at each:

z=0:1

z=0.7375: (1.7375)^3≈5.34

0.3*5.34≈1.60 +0.7=2.30

f=1/sqrt(2.30)=~0.585

z=1.475: (2.475)^3≈14.21

0.3*14.21≈4.26 +0.7=4.96

f=1/sqrt(4.96)=~0.447

z=2.2125: (3.2125)^3≈33.6

0.3*33.6≈10.08 +0.7=10.78

f=1/sqrt(10.78)=~0.389

z=2.95: f≈0.351

Now, using Simpson's rule:

Integral≈(Δz'/3)[f(z0) + 4f(z1) + 2f(z2) +4f(z3) +f(z4)]

Δz'=2.95/4≈0.7375

≈(0.7375/3)[1 +4*0.585 +2*0.447 +4*0.389 +0.351]

Compute inside:

1 + 2.34 + 0.894 + 1.556 +0.351

1 +2.34=3.34; +0.894=4.234; +1.556=5.79; +0.351=6.141

Multiply by 0.7375/3≈0.2458

≈0.2458 *6.141≈1.514

So, I(z=2.95)=≈1.514

Thus, DCoM=4.285*1.514≈6.50 Gpc

Still not 9 Gpc.

Wait, maybe even higher redshift? Let's try z=3.

Compute I(z=3):

(1 +3)=4

4^3=64

0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9

f(z)=1/sqrt(19.9)=~0.343

Compute I(z=3)=∫0^3 f(z') dz'

Again, using Simpson's rule with n=4:

z'=0,0.75,1.5,2.25,3

Compute f:

z=0:1

z=0.75: (1.75)^3≈5.36

0.3*5.36≈1.61 +0.7=2.31

f=1/sqrt(2.31)=~0.586

z=1.5: (2.5)^3=15.625

0.3*15.625=4.6875 +0.7=5.3875

f=1/sqrt(5.3875)=~0.456

z=2.25: (3.25)^3≈34.3

0.3*34.3≈10.29 +0.7=10.99

f=1/sqrt(10.99)=~0.381

z=3: f≈0.343

Simpson's rule:

Integral≈(3/4)[f(z0) +4f(z1)+2f(z2)+4f(z3)+f(z4)]

Δz'=0.75

≈(0.75/3)[1 +4*0.586 +2*0.456 +4*0.381 +0.343]

Compute inside:

1 +2.344=3.344; +0.912=4.256; +1.524=5.78; +0.343=6.123

Multiply by 0.25:

≈0.25*6.123≈1.531

Thus, I(z=3)=≈1.531

DCoM=4.285*1.531≈6.58 Gpc

Still not 9 Gpc.

Wait, perhaps the redshift is even higher, like z=4.

Compute I(z=4):

(1 +4)=5

5^3=125

0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2

f(z)=1/sqrt(38.2)=~0.271

Compute I(z=4)=∫0^4 f(z') dz'

Using Simpson's rule with n=4:

z'=0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4

But that's too many points, let's do n=6.

Wait, maybe better to use a larger n for accuracy, but this is getting tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is 9 Gpc, so maybe the redshift is around z=2.5

Compute I(z=2.5):

(1 +2.5)=3.5

3.5^3=42.875

0.3*42.875≈12.8625 +0.7=13.5625

f(z)=1/sqrt(13.5625)=~
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The peak wavelength is around 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. The question is asking about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth in a universe with specific parameters: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy ΩΛ = 0.7, and the universe is flat.

Hmm, I remember that the comoving distance is a way to measure how far away a distant object is, considering the expansion of the universe. In a flat universe, which this one is, the comoving distance is calculated using integrals involving the Hubble parameter and the components of the universe's matter and dark energy.

Wait, so in a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy, the comoving distance for a given redshift z can be found by integrating 1/(H0 E(z)) from 0 to z, where E(z) is the function that depends on the matter and dark energy parameters. Since the universe is flat, E(z) = √(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). Because Ωm and ΩΛ are the density parameters, their sum is 1.

Given that the quasar has a peak wavelength at 790 nm, I think this relates to the redshift. The observed wavelength λ is related to the emitted wavelength λ0 by the relation λ = λ0(1 + z). So, if the peak is at 790 nm, assuming that this is the rest wavelength, then the redshift z would be (790 nm - λ0)/λ0. Wait, but I don't know the rest wavelength λ0. Maybe the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, but the rest frame is different?

Wait, no, more accurately, the quasar emits a rest wavelength λ0, and we observe it as λ. So, λ = λ0(1 + z). So, z = (λ - λ0)/λ0. But without knowing λ0, I can't directly compute z. However, usually, for such problems, we might assume that the peak is observed at 790 nm, which would correspond to a rest wavelength in the near-infrared or optical.

Wait, but actually, if the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, how does that relate to the rest frame? If the quasar is emitting in the rest frame, the rest wavelength would be shorter. Hmm, perhaps I need to assume that in the quasar's rest frame, the peak is at a shorter wavelength, say, around the rest-frame optical or near-infrared.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the comoving distance, not the redshift directly. So, perhaps I need to use the observed wavelength of 790 nm to find the redshift, and then compute the comoving distance from that redshift.

But wait, to get the redshift, I need the rest wavelength. But I don't have that. Maybe it's a standard quasar, and the peak emission is in the rest-frame optical? So, if observed at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, and if the rest frame is optical, let's say the rest wavelength is about 500 nm (for example). So, z = (790 - 500)/500 = 0.59.

But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's rest frame peak is in the near-infrared, say 1200 nm, so z = (790 - 1200)/1200 = negative, which can't be. Hmm, so maybe the rest wavelength is longer than 790 nm, so that (1 + z) makes it longer.

Wait, no. If the quasar is at a high redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So, if the rest wavelength is λ0, the observed is λ = λ0(1 + z). So, if λ = 790 nm, and we don't know λ0, we can't directly compute z.

But perhaps the question assumes that the peak is at 790 nm in the rest frame. So, z = 0, and the comoving distance would be zero, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the observed wavelength being 790 nm, which implies a redshift, so z = (λ_observed - λ_emitted)/λ_emitted. But without knowing λ_emitted, perhaps we can only proceed if we relate the peak to a standard candle or something.

Wait, no, the question is more about the comoving distance. Maybe since the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that indicates a high redshift. Because the quasar's spectrum is redshifted, so the peak moves to longer wavelengths. So, if we're seeing the peak at 790 nm, that suggests that the rest frame peak is at a shorter wavelength, and z is determined accordingly.

But without knowing λ0, I'm stuck. Wait, maybe the question is more straightforward. It just says there's a peak at 790 nm, and less flux at shorter wavelengths, so we can assume that this is the rest wavelength. So, z = (λ - λ0)/λ0 = 0. That can't be, because then the comoving distance is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. The quasar's rest frame is at a high redshift, so the peak wavelength is observed at 790 nm. So, in the rest frame, the peak is at some shorter wavelength λ0, and observed as 790 nm, so 790 = λ0(1 + z). So, z = (790/λ0) - 1.

But without knowing λ0, we can't find z. Therefore, perhaps the question is that the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is the peak, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, so we can use this as an indicator of redshift. But without knowing the rest wavelength, I can't compute z.

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the quasar's spectrum is redshifted, so the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths suggests that the rest frame had a peak at a shorter wavelength, so the quasar is at a moderate redshift. But again, without knowing the rest wavelength, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the 790 nm is the rest wavelength. So, if the quasar's rest frame peak is at 790 nm, then the redshift is zero, which again doesn't make sense. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar is emitting in the rest frame near 790 nm, but due to the expansion of the universe, we observe it at a longer wavelength. Wait, but that would imply a redshift, so z = (observed - rest)/rest. So, if the rest is 790 nm, then z = 0. So, again, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the observed and rest frame. Let's think again. The quasar emits light at wavelength λ0 in its rest frame. We observe it at wavelength λ = λ0(1 + z). So, if λ is 790 nm, then z = (λ - λ0)/λ0 = λ/λ0 - 1.

But without λ0, we can't find z. So, perhaps the problem is that the peak is at 790 nm, and the rest frame peak is in the optical, say around 500 nm, so z = (790 - 500)/500 ≈ 0.59.

Alternatively, if the rest frame peak is in the near-infrared, say 1200 nm, then z = (790 - 1200)/1200 ≈ -0.034, which is negative, which can't be. So, maybe the rest frame peak is in the optical.

But again, without knowing λ0, I can't get z. Wait, but maybe the question is simply saying that the quasar is at a high redshift such that its peak is observed in the near-infrared, implying that in the rest frame, it's in optical, so z is such that λ0(1 + z) = 790 nm.

But without λ0, I can't get z. So, maybe the question assumes that the peak is redshifted into the near-infrared, so we can use the Hubble parameters to compute comoving distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply using the fact that the peak is at 790 nm, and we can use this to find the redshift, and then compute the comoving distance.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up the formula for comoving distance. In a flat universe, the comoving distance D_C is given by:

D_C = (1/H0) * ∫_0^z 1 / E(z') dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ).

So, given H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, and Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7.

But to compute D_C, we need the redshift z. So, how do we get z?

The question mentions that the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. So, perhaps the quasar's spectrum is such that it peaks at 790 nm, which suggests a redshift. Because if it were at lower redshift, the peak would be at shorter wavelengths (bluer).

So, if the peak is at 790 nm, and in the rest frame, it's at a shorter wavelength, say, let's assume a typical quasar rest-frame peak is around 500 nm (green light). So, z = (790 - 500)/500 = 0.59.

Alternatively, if the rest frame peak is around 1200 nm (near-infrared), then z would be negative, which is impossible. So, the rest frame peak must be in the optical, so z is positive.

So, let's say z ≈ 0.59.

Then, we can compute D_C using the integral.

So, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + 0.59)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(2.59)^3 + 0.7).

Calculate 2.59^3: 2.59 * 2.59 = 6.7081, 6.7081 * 2.59 ≈ 17.37.

So, 0.3 * 17.37 ≈ 5.211.

Then, E(z) = sqrt(5.211 + 0.7) = sqrt(5.911) ≈ 2.431.

So, E(z) ≈ 2.431.

Then, the integral from 0 to 0.59 of 1/E(z') dz'.

To compute this integral numerically, since it's not straightforward analytically.

We can use an approximation or use a table of values.

Alternatively, recall that in a matter-dominated universe (Ωm=1, ΩΛ=0), the comoving distance for z is given by (2/(H0 sqrt(Ωm))) ln((1 + z) sqrt(Ωm) + 1)).

But in this case, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7, so it's a dark energy dominated universe.

Alternatively, we can use the lookback time function, but we need the integral.

Alternatively, use the approximation formula or look up the values for D_C in such a universe.

Alternatively, use a calculator or integral table.

But perhaps I can approximate the integral.

Let me try to compute the integral ∫_0^0.59 1/2.431 dz = 0.59 / 2.431 ≈ 0.59 / 2.43 ≈ 0.2426.

But that's a very rough approximation, assuming E(z) is constant, which it's not.

In reality, E(z) changes with z, so the integral is more complex.

Alternatively, use a series expansion or numerical integration.

Alternatively, use an online calculator for comoving distance.

But since I don't have that, perhaps I can recall that for H0=70, and z=0.6, the comoving distance is roughly...

Wait, let's think about how to compute this.

First, define E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

We can compute E(z) at various z points and perform a trapezoidal or Simpson's rule integration.

Let me try to compute the integral using Simpson's rule with a few points.

First, define the function f(z) = 1/E(z).

We need to integrate from z=0 to z=0.59.

Let me divide the interval into, say, four intervals: 0 to 0.35, 0.35 to 0.7, but wait, 0.59 is less than 0.7. So, let's take dz steps of 0.35, but that's too large. Let's take dz=0.2.

Wait, better to take dz=0.2, so we have points at z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 (but we only need up to 0.59).

Wait, at z=0.59, so let me take points at z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.59.

Compute f(z)=1/E(z) at these points.

Compute E(z):

At z=0: E= sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=sqrt(1)=1. So, f=1.

At z=0.2: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*1.728 +0.7)=sqrt(0.5184 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.2184)=1.103. So, f=1/1.103≈0.905.

At z=0.4: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.4)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*2.744 +0.7)=sqrt(0.8232 +0.7)=sqrt(1.5232)≈1.234. So, f≈0.809.

At z=0.6: E= sqrt(0.3*(2.2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*10.648 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1944 +0.7)=sqrt(3.8944)=1.972. So, f≈0.506.

Wait, but we only go up to z=0.59, so maybe take the average between z=0.59 and z=0.6.

Compute E at z=0.59:

E= sqrt(0.3*(1.59)^3 +0.7). 1.59^3 ≈ 4.03. So, 0.3*4.03≈1.209. So, E= sqrt(1.209 + 0.7)=sqrt(1.909)≈1.381. So, f≈0.723.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with z=0.6, which gives E≈1.972. Wait, no, z=0.59 is less than z=0.6, so E should be less than at z=0.6. Wait, no, E(z) increases with z because Ωm(1+z)^3 increases.

Wait, at z=0.59, 1+z=1.59, so 1.59^3 ≈ 4.03. Then 0.3*4.03≈1.209, plus 0.7 gives E≈sqrt(1.909)≈1.381.

Wait, but at z=0.6, 1+z=1.6, 1.6^3=4.096, 0.3*4.096≈1.2288, plus 0.7 gives E≈sqrt(1.9288)≈1.388.

Wait, that seems inconsistent because z=0.59 should have a slightly lower E than z=0.6.

Wait, let me compute E(z=0.59):

1+z=1.59

(1.59)^3 = 4.029

0.3*4.029 = 1.2087

1.2087 +0.7=1.9087

sqrt(1.9087)=1.381

Similarly, at z=0.6:

1+z=1.6

(1.6)^3=4.096

0.3*4.096=1.2288

1.2288+0.7=1.9288

sqrt(1.9288)≈1.388

So, E at z=0.59 is ≈1.381, and at z=0.6 is ≈1.388.

So, to approximate the integral, we can use the trapezoidal rule with points at z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.59, 0.6.

Wait, but Simpson's rule is better for integrating smooth functions. Let's try Simpson's 1/3 rule.

Divide the interval [0, 0.59] into n=2 intervals, which would require three points: z=0, z=0.29, z=0.58.

But that's not enough. Alternatively, n=4 intervals would be better, but that's more work.

Alternatively, let's just use the trapezoidal rule with the points we have: z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.59, 0.6.

Wait, but the interval from 0.59 to 0.6 is beyond our upper limit of 0.59, so perhaps it's better to take points at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.59.

So, with four points: z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.59.

Using the trapezoidal rule, the integral ≈ (Δz/2)[f(0) + 2f(0.2) + 2f(0.4) + f(0.59)]

Δz=0.59

So, (0.59/2)[1 + 2*0.905 + 2*0.809 + 0.723]

Compute inside:

1 + 1.81 + 1.618 + 0.723 = 1 + 1.81=2.81; 2.81 +1.618=4.428; 4.428 +0.723≈5.151

Multiply by 0.59/2=0.295

So, 5.151 *0.295≈1.517

So, the integral is approximately 1.517.

Then, D_C = (1/H0) * integral.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So, 1/H0 ≈ 1/70 Mpc⁻¹ s.

So, D_C ≈ 1.517 * (1/70) Mpc ≈ 0.02166 Mpc.

Wait, that can't be right because 9 Gpc is 9000 Mpc, which is way larger.

Wait, I must have done something wrong.

Wait, no, hold on, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so 1/H0 is approximately 1/70 Mpc⁻¹ per s.

But the integral is dimensionless, so D_C = (1/H0) * integral ≈ 1.517 * (1/70) Mpc ≈ 0.02166 Mpc, which is about 21.66 Mpc.

But the answer is supposed to be 9 Gpc, which is 9000 Mpc. So, I must have made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 7e4 m/s/Mpc.

But the comoving distance is in units of Mpc, so D_C = c * ∫ dt/(a² H) from t=0 to t=now.

But in terms of integrals, it's (1/H0) ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'

So, the integral is unitless, and 1/H0 has units of Mpc.

So, if the integral is about 1.5, then D_C ≈ 1.5 /70 ≈0.021 Mpc, which is about 21 Mpc.

But the correct answer is 9 Gpc, so I must have messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I didn't compute the integral correctly. Let me check the function values again.

At z=0: E=1, f=1.

z=0.2: E≈1.103, f≈0.905.

z=0.4: E≈1.234, f≈0.809.

z=0.59: E≈1.381, f≈0.723.

Wait, but when I computed the integral using trapezoidal rule, I got 1.517, but that's in units of [1/E(z)] dz, which is unitless, so D_C = (1/70)*1.517 Mpc ≈ 0.0217 Mpc.

But 0.0217 Mpc is 21.7 Mpc, which is way smaller than 9 Gpc.

Wait, that can't be. So, I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the function. The integral is ∫1/E(z) dz from 0 to z.

But E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

So, the function to integrate is 1/E(z) = 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7)

But when I computed f(z)=1/E(z), I think I did it correctly.

Wait, but perhaps I should not have used z=0.59, because if the peak is at 790 nm, and assuming the rest frame is around 500 nm, z=0.59, but perhaps the redshift is higher.

Wait, perhaps the rest frame peak is in the near-infrared. Let's say the rest frame peak is at 1200 nm, then observed at 790 nm, so z=(790 -1200)/1200 ≈ -0.034, which is impossible. So, the rest frame peak must be in the optical, so the observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, maybe the rest frame peak is at 500 nm, so the redshift is (790 -500)/500=0.59, as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest frame peak is at 600 nm, so z=(790-600)/600≈0.305.

Wait, but then the redshift is smaller, so comoving distance is smaller.

Wait, but the correct answer is 9 Gpc, which is 9000 Mpc, which is very far, so high redshift.

So, perhaps I need to assume a higher redshift.

Wait, but how? Because 790 nm is the observed wavelength, so unless the rest wavelength is much shorter, z would be high only if λ0 is small.

Wait, but if λ0 is in the ultraviolet, say 200 nm, then z=(790-200)/200=1.29.

So, z≈1.29.

Let me try that.

So, let's assume the rest frame peak is at 200 nm, observed at 790 nm, so z=1.29.

Compute E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+1.29)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*(2.29)^3 +0.7).

Compute 2.29^3=2.29*2.29=5.24, 5.24*2.29≈12.0.

So, 0.3*12.0=3.6.

E= sqrt(3.6 +0.7)=sqrt(4.3)=2.073.

So, E(z)=2.073 at z=1.29.

Then, compute the integral ∫_0^1.29 1/E(z') dz'.

Again, compute this numerically.

Let me try to compute the integral using Simpson's rule.

But to do that, I need to compute f(z)=1/E(z) at several points.

Let me take dz=0.2 from z=0 to z=1.29, so points at z=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.29.

Compute E(z) and f(z) at each point:

z=0: E=1, f=1.

z=0.2: E=sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*1.728+0.7)=sqrt(0.5184+0.7)=sqrt(1.2184)=1.103, f≈0.905.

z=0.4: E=sqrt(0.3*(1.4)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*2.744+0.7)=sqrt(0.8232+0.7)=sqrt(1.5232)≈1.234, f≈0.809.

z=0.6: E=sqrt(0.3*(1.6)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*4.096 +0.7)=sqrt(1.2288 +0.7)=sqrt(1.9288)≈1.388, f≈0.723.

z=0.8: E=sqrt(0.3*(1.8)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*5.832 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7496 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4496)≈1.565, f≈0.640.

z=1.0: E=sqrt(0.3*(2.0)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)≈1.761, f≈0.569.

z=1.2: E=sqrt(0.3*(2.2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*10.648 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1944 +0.7)=sqrt(3.8944)≈1.972, f≈0.506.

z=1.29: E=sqrt(0.3*(2.29)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*12.032 +0.7)=sqrt(3.6096 +0.7)=sqrt(4.3096)≈2.077, f≈0.481.

Now, let's apply Simpson's rule with n=8 intervals (dz=0.2 each), but since it's an odd number, we can pair them as (0,0.2), (0.2,0.4), ..., (1.2,1.29). So, n=8 intervals, which is even, but we have 9 points.

Wait, no, Simpson's rule requires an even number of intervals if we have an odd number of points. Wait, with 8 intervals (dz=0.2 each), we have 9 points, which is okay.

Simpson's rule formula is:

∫a^b f(x) dx ≈ (Δx/3)[f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + 2f(x4) + ... + 4f(xn-1) + f(xn)]

So, with our points:

z=0: f=1

z=0.2: f=0.905

z=0.4: f=0.809

z=0.6: f=0.723

z=0.8: f=0.640

z=1.0: f=0.569

z=1.2: f=0.506

z=1.29: f=0.481

So, the coefficients alternate 1,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,1.

So,

(Δz/3)[1 + 4*0.905 + 2*0.809 + 4*0.723 + 2*0.640 + 4*0.569 + 2*0.506 + 4*0.481 + 0.481]

Δz=0.2, so:

(0.2/3)[1 + 3.62 + 1.618 + 2.892 + 1.28 + 2.276 + 1.012 + 1.924 + 0.481]

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, list all the terms:

f(z0)=1

f(z1)=0.905, multiplied by 4: 3.62

f(z2)=0.809, multiplied by 2: 1.618

f(z3)=0.723, multiplied by 4: 2.892

f(z4)=0.640, multiplied by 2: 1.28

f(z5)=0.569, multiplied by 4: 2.276

f(z6)=0.506, multiplied by 2: 1.012

f(z7)=0.481, multiplied by 4: 1.924

f(z8)=0.481

Wait, no, the last term is f(z8)=0.481, which is multiplied by 1.

So, sum all these:

1 + 3.62 = 4.62

+1.618 = 6.238

+2.892 = 9.13

+1.28 =10.41

+2.276=12.686

+1.012=13.698

+1.924=15.622

+0.481=16.103

So, total sum=16.103

Multiply by (0.2)/3≈0.0666667

So, 16.103 *0.0666667≈1.07.

So, the integral≈1.07.

Therefore, D_C=(1/H0)*1.07≈1.07/(70)≈0.0153 Mpc≈15 Mpc.

Still, that's way smaller than 9 Gpc.

Wait, so perhaps the rest frame peak is at even shorter wavelength, say, 100 nm (ultraviolet). Then z=(790-100)/100≈6.9.

But that's a very high redshift. Let's try that.

z≈6.9.

Compute E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+6.9)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*(7.9)^3 +0.7)

7.9^3≈493.039

0.3*493.039≈147.9117

147.9117 +0.7≈148.6117

E≈sqrt(148.6117)≈12.19

So, E(z)=12.19.

Then, compute ∫_0^6.9 1/12.19 dz=6.9/12.19≈0.566.

So, D_C≈0.566/(70)≈0.0081 Mpc≈8.1 Mpc.

Still way below 9 Gpc.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the question is implying that the quasar is at a redshift where its optical/IR peak is observed in the near-infrared, so it's at a moderate redshift, but considering the parameters, the comoving distance comes out to be around 9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the quasar's light is at a redshift z where the comoving distance is 9 Gpc, given the cosmology, and the observed wavelength of 790 nm.

Wait, let me think differently. The comoving distance D_C is related to the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter.

In a flat universe, D_C = (1/H0) * ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'

But also, D_C = c * ∫_0^t dt'/a(t') where t' is the conformal time.

But maybe it's better to use the relation between redshift and comoving distance.

Given that H0=70, and the comoving distance is 9 Gpc=9000 Mpc.

So, 9000 /70 ≈128.57 Mpc≈1/H0.

But the integral ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'= D_C * H0 =9000.

So, 9000= ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'

So, the integral of 1/E(z) from 0 to z is 9000.

But E(z)=sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7)

So, we need to solve for z in:

∫_0^z 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7) dz' =9000.

This is a difficult integral to solve analytically, so we need to approximate z.

Let me try to estimate z.

Let me make a table of E(z) and ∫ from 0 to z.

But this will take time.

Alternatively, note that E(z)=sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7)

So, 0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7 = E^2.

So, (1+z)^3=(E^2 -0.7)/0.3

Thus, 1+z= [(E^2 -0.7)/0.3]^(1/3)

So, z= [(E^2 -0.7)/0.3]^(1/3) -1

We need to find z such that the integral of 1/E(z') from 0 to z equals 9000.

But this is a difficult equation to solve.

Alternatively, we can use the approximation that for high redshifts, the universe is dominated by dark energy, so E(z)≈sqrt(ΩΛ)=sqrt(0.7)≈0.836. But that's not the case because for high z, matter dominated, but in this case, dark energy is dominant now.

Wait, no, for high z, the matter term is more significant because the expansion is accelerating due to dark energy.

Wait, but the integral ∫1/E(z) dz from 0 to z is basically the same as the lookback time function multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I recall that for the comoving distance in a flat universe, the integral can be expressed in terms of the inverse hyperbolic functions or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the approximation formula from papers or textbooks.

Alternatively, perhaps use the online comoving distance calculator.

But since I can't do that, perhaps I can use the fact that for large z, the integral can be approximated.

But perhaps the answer is 9 Gpc because that's the given answer, but I need to explain why.

Alternatively, the question is implying that the peak being at 790 nm corresponds to a redshift where the comoving distance is 9 Gpc.

So, perhaps we can use the relation between redshift and comoving distance.

Given that the quasar is at a comoving distance of 9 Gpc, which is D_C=9e3 Mpc.

So, D_C=9e3 Mpc= (1/H0) ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'

So, ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'= H0 * D_C=70 *9e3=630,000.

So, we have ∫_0^z 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7) dz'=630,000.

This integral is hard to solve, but perhaps we can estimate z.

Let me try to find z such that ∫_0^z 1/E(z') dz'≈630,000.

Let me try to approximate the integral by breaking it into parts.

Note that E(z) increases as z increases, so 1/E(z) decreases.

But to get a large integral of 6e5, z must be quite large.

Let me try z=1.5.

Compute E(1.5)=sqrt(0.3*(2.5)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*15.625 +0.7)=sqrt(4.6875 +0.7)=sqrt(5.3875)≈2.32.

So, ∫_0^1.5 1/2.32
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth is 9 Gpc in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model with specific parameters. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Lambda-CDM model and comoving distances.

The Lambda-CDM model is a model of cosmology where the universe is dominated by dark energy (the lambda term) and matter. It includes dark matter, ordinary matter, dark energy, and radiation. The parameters given are:
- Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km/s/Mpc
- Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3
- Dark energy density parameter (Ω_λ) = 0.7
- The universe is flat, which means Ω_total = Ω_m + Ω_λ + Ω_rad = 1. Since Ω_rad is usually negligible at the current epoch, it's approximately 0.3 + 0.7 = 1, so that's consistent.

Now, the question is about a quasar observed in near-infrared and optical. The peak is at about 790 nm. So, I need to think about how that wavelength relates to the redshift of the quasar. If the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that probably means that the quasar is moving away from us, so the light is redshifted. Thus, the redshift z is key here.

First, let me figure out the redshift of the quasar. The peak wavelength is 790 nm. But I need the emitted wavelength to compare. I know that for optical wavelengths, the peak is usually in the rest frame, so maybe around 400 nm or something? Wait, that might not be necessarily true. Quasars can have broad emission lines, but the peak can be in the rest frame or shifted.

Wait, hold on. The quasar emits light at a certain wavelength, and as it moves away, the wavelength is stretched by (1 + z). So, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So, if the peak is at 790 nm, and assuming that in the rest frame, the peak is somewhere else, but for the sake of this problem, maybe I can just use the observed wavelength to estimate the redshift.

But actually, the peak being at 790 nm could mean that the rest frame wavelength is 790 / (1 + z). Hmm, but how do I know the rest frame wavelength? Maybe I need to assume that the peak is in the same part of the spectrum as it would be in the rest frame.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the drop in flux at shorter wavelengths is due to the quasar being redshifted. Because if the universe is expanding, the light from the quasar is stretched, so blue light (shorter wavelengths) is shifted into the red (longer wavelengths). So, if at shorter wavelengths the flux drops, that might mean that there's a cutoff because the rest frame emission is at longer wavelengths, implying a high redshift.

Wait, maybe if the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that suggests that the quasar's rest frame spectrum is being redshifted beyond the observed wavelength. So, if I think about it, in the rest frame, the quasar emits some flux, but when we observe it, the wavelength is stretched. So, if the observed flux drops at shorter wavelengths, maybe the quasar's rest frame spectrum doesn't have much flux at those wavelengths, because they are shifted into the longer wavelengths we observe.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key is that the quasar is at a high redshift, so the (1 + z) factor is significant, meaning that the comoving distance can be calculated.

Alternatively, another approach is that the comoving distance is a function of the cosmological parameters and the redshift. So, if I can calculate the redshift z, then I can find the comoving distance using the Hubble parameter and the integral over a(aH)^{-1} da.

But since the question gives the answer as 9 Gpc, and asks why, I can work backwards.

First, what redshift corresponds to a comoving distance of 9 Gpc in a flat Lambda-CDM universe with H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc.

I know that the comoving distance D_c is given by:

D_c = (c / H₀) * ∫_{0}^{z} 1 / √(Ω_m(1 + z')³ + Ω_λ) dz'

Where c is the speed of light, and the integral is from z=0 to the redshift z.

So, if D_c = 9 Gpc, and H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70 * 10^3 m/s / (3.086e22 m) ≈ 2.27e-18 s^{-1}. Wait, no, H₀ is in units of km/s/Mpc, so to get H₀ in s^{-1}, it's 70 km/s/Mpc * (1 Mpc / 3.086e22 m) * (1 s / 1 km) ≈ 70 / 3.086e-18 s^{-1} ≈ 2.27e-16 s^{-1}.

But perhaps it's easier to convert H₀ to s^{-1}:

H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70,000 m/s / Mpc. Since 1 Mpc is 3.086e22 m, so H₀ = 70,000 / 3.086e22 ≈ 2.27e-18 s^{-1}.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, (c / H₀) ≈ (3e8 m/s) / (2.27e-18 s^{-1}) ≈ 1.32e26 m. But 1 parsec is about 3.08e16 m, so 1 Gpc is 3.08e25 m. Therefore, 1.32e26 m is approximately 4.3 Gpc. Wait, that can't be, because D_c is 9 Gpc. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, the term (c / H₀) is in units of Gpc/(km/s/Mpc). Since H₀ is in km/s/Mpc, the conversion is:

c = 3e5 km/s, H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc.

So, c / H₀ = 3e5 / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. So, 4285.7 Mpc is the value of (c / H₀).

But D_c = (c / H₀) * ∫_{0}^{z} 1 / √(Ω_m(1 + z')³ + Ω_λ) dz'

So, if D_c = 9 Gpc, then:

9 Gpc = 4285.7 Mpc * ∫_{0}^{z} 1 / √(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) dz'

Therefore, ∫_{0}^{z} 1 / √(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) dz' ≈ 9 Gpc / 4285.7 Mpc ≈ 2.097e-3.

So, we need to solve for z such that the integral from 0 to z of 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) dz' ≈ 0.002097.

This integral is a standard one for comoving distance in a flat universe. It's not analytically solvable, so we need to approximate it.

I can try to numerically integrate the function f(z') = 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) from z'=0 to z.

Let me define:

f(z') = 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7)

So, the integral I = ∫₀^z f(z') dz'.

I need to find z such that I ≈ 0.002097.

I can use numerical methods, such as Simpson's rule, or approximate using series expansion. Alternatively, I can use an approximate formula for the integral.

I recall that for a flat universe with Ω_m and Ω_λ, the comoving distance can be expressed in terms of the function E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1 + z)^3 + Ω_λ).

The integral becomes ∫0^z 1/E(z') dz'.

This integral can be approximated for large z, but since Ω_λ is dominant (0.7), even for moderate z, E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_λ + Ω_m z³).

Wait, for z where Ω_λ(1 + z)^3 >> Ω_m, which is likely true here since Ω_λ = 0.7, Ω_m = 0.3.

So, E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z³). But maybe even better approximation is E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.7 + 0.3(z')^3) if z is not too large.

So, if we model E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z^3), then the integral becomes ∫₀^z 1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z'^3) dz'.

I think this integral can be expressed in terms of the beta function or hypergeometric function, but perhaps I can use a substitution.

Let me make the substitution t = z'^3, so dt = 3 z'^2 dz', which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of the function:

∫ 1 / sqrt(a + b z^3) dz.

Hmm, I think there is a standard integral for this. Let me recall.

I can use the substitution u = z^{3/2}, so z = u^{2/3}, dz = (2/3) u^{-1/3} du.

Then, the integral becomes ∫ [ (2/3) u^{-1/3} ] / sqrt(a + b u²) du.

So, if we set a = 0.7, b = 0.3, then:

I = (2/3) ∫ u^{-1/3} / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 u²) du.

This is similar to the integral representation of the hypergeometric function or perhaps the incomplete elliptic integral. But without getting too deep into that, maybe I can approximate this numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the integral ∫0^z 1 / sqrt(c + d z'^3) dz' for small z, but if z is large, the integral can be approximated differently.

Wait, maybe I can use substitution for small z, but since z is the variable we're solving for, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a series expansion for small z, but given that 0.002 Gpc is a relatively small distance, z might be small.

Alternatively, let's make a substitution: let t = z'^3.

Wait, another idea: Let me note that for high redshift z, the term 0.3 z'^3 may dominate over 0.7, so perhaps the integral can be approximated as:

I ≈ ∫₀^z 1 / sqrt(0.3 z'^3) dz' = ∫₀^z (1 / (0.3^{1/2} z'^{3/2})) dz' = (1 / (0.3^{1/2})) ∫₀^z z'^{-3/2} dz' = (1 / 0.3^{1/2}) * [ -2 z'^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z = (1 / 0.3^{1/2}) * (-2 / sqrt(z)) = (2 / 0.3^{1/2}) / sqrt(z).

But this is only valid when 0.3 z^3 >> 0.7, which would require z³ >> 0.7 / 0.3 ≈ 2.333, so z >> (2.333)^{1/3} ≈ 1.32.

But if z is larger than 1.32, then this approximation is valid. However, for z < 1.32, the 0.7 term is significant, so this approximation would not be accurate.

But in our case, we have I ≈ 0.002097. Let's check what z would be.

Assuming that for large z, the integral is roughly I ≈ (2 / sqrt(0.3)) / sqrt(z). Setting I ≈ 0.002097:

0.002097 ≈ (2 / sqrt(0.3)) / sqrt(z)

Compute 2 / sqrt(0.3) ≈ 2 / 0.5477 ≈ 3.65.

So, 3.65 / sqrt(z) ≈ 0.002097

Therefore, sqrt(z) ≈ 3.65 / 0.002097 ≈ 1744. So, z ≈ (1744)^2 ≈ 3,032, which is a very high redshift. But wait, that can't be, since the quasar would be at z = 3,032, which is extremely high, but the problem is talking about the peak in the observed spectrum at 790 nm. If z were 3,032, the rest frame wavelength would be 790 / (1 + 3,032) ≈ 790 / 3,033 ≈ 0.261 nm, which is in the X-ray range, which seems unlikely for a quasar's emission peak.

So, perhaps the approximation I did is not valid here, meaning that z is not as high as 3,032. Therefore, I need a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's redshift is such that the peak at 790 nm is due to the Lyman-alpha forest or something similar, but I think that's more of a feature in quasar spectra from absorption by intervening matter.

Wait, maybe the key is that the quasar is at a redshift where 790 nm is the rest-frame Lyman-alpha line, but that usually is around 121 nm, so that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's the emission line peak, such as the broad emission line region. Quasars often have emission lines around certain rest-frame wavelengths, such as the C IV line at about 165 nm, or the Lyman-alpha at 121 nm, but I'm not sure how that relates to the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in the rest frame, the peak emission is around a certain wavelength, and when redshifted, it appears at 790 nm. So, if we denote λ_emit as the rest frame wavelength, then λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + z). So, if the peak is at 790 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / λ_emit.

But unless we know the rest frame wavelength, we can't get z directly. So, unless there is another way.

Alternatively, perhaps since the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that is, the observed spectrum is such that below 790 nm, the flux is lower. That could be due to the quasar's spectrum being redshifted beyond the observed range, but that depends on the rest frame.

Wait, actually, if the rest frame spectrum has a peak at a certain wavelength, say λ_peak_rest, then when redshifted, it appears at λ_peak_obs = λ_peak_rest * (1 + z).

If we observe a peak at 790 nm, that might suggest that the rest frame peak is at a shorter wavelength. But in the absence of knowing the rest frame, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths implies that the quasar's rest frame spectrum is such that wavelengths shorter than some rest frame wavelength are not emitted, perhaps due to some cutoff, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe it's that the quasar is so far away that the light is redshifted beyond the optical into the near-infrared, and the optical peak (rest frame) is shifted into the near-infrared.

Wait, quasars are extremely luminous and are observed at high redshifts. So, for example, a quasar emitting light at rest frame optical wavelengths would have its light stretched into near-infrared and possibly even more if z is high.

But 790 nm is in the near-infrared. So, if the rest frame peak is, say, around 400 nm (blue), and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the redshift z is (790 / 400) - 1 ≈ 1.975.

Wait, so z ≈ 1.975.

Alternatively, if the rest frame peak is around 500 nm, then z = (790 / 500) - 1 ≈ 1.36.

But unless we know the rest frame peak wavelength, this is hard to determine.

Wait, but the question says that the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths, i.e., below 790 nm. So, for a quasar, if the rest frame spectrum has a peak in the optical, then as it's redshifted, the peak moves into the near-infrared. So, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, the rest frame peak would be at 790 / (1 + z).

But since the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, perhaps the rest frame spectrum doesn't have much flux at shorter wavelengths, so the redshifted version doesn't have much flux below 790 nm, which would mean that the rest frame spectrum's shorter wavelengths are not that bright or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's rest frame spectrum peaks at a certain wavelength, say λ_peak_rest, and when we observe it, the peak is at 790 nm. So, the redshift z determines where that peak is observed.

But without knowing the rest frame peak, it's difficult to get z. Maybe the key is that in the rest frame, the peak is in the near-infrared, but that seems counterintuitive because quasars are usually observed in the optical when they are at lower redshifts.

Wait, maybe the key is that the quasar is so far away that its light is redshifted beyond the optical into the near-infrared, so its rest frame peak is in the rest-frame near-infrared, but that seems unlikely because quasars are typically observed in the optical.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the quasar's observed wavelength peak being in the near-infrared. So, the rest frame would have that peak in a shorter wavelength. For example, if a quasar emits a peak in the rest frame at 400 nm (blue light), then at z = 2, the observed wavelength would be 400 * (1 + 2) = 1200 nm, which is in the near-infrared. Similarly, if the rest frame peak is 500 nm (green), then at z = 1.36, it's observed at 790 nm.

Wait, that's exactly the calculation I did earlier. So, if λ_peak_rest = 500 nm, then z = (790 / 500) - 1 = 1.36.

So, perhaps we can assume that the rest frame peak is at 500 nm, and therefore the redshift z is around 1.36.

Alternatively, maybe the rest frame peak is at 700 nm, so z = (790 / 700) - 1 ≈ 0.14.

But then the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which would suggest that the rest frame spectrum doesn't have much flux below 700 nm. But unless the quasar's rest frame spectrum is such that it's brighter at longer wavelengths, but that's not typical.

Wait, perhaps the rest frame spectrum for quasars usually has a peak in the near-ultraviolet or optical, so when redshifted, it moves into the observed optical or near-infrared. If the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, then depending on the rest frame, z can vary.

But without more information, maybe the key is that the redshift is z ≈ 1.36, and with that, we can compute the comoving distance.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar is at a much higher redshift, but the observed peak is at 790 nm because the rest frame peak is in the far-infrared or something, but that might be stretching it.

Wait, perhaps I can look up an example. Suppose a quasar has a rest frame peak emission in the Lyman-alpha forest, but that's more about absorption.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Maybe the main point is that the quasar is at a redshift z where the comoving distance is 9 Gpc in a universe with H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_λ = 0.7.

So, perhaps I should directly compute the comoving distance for a given z.

Wait, but we need to connect the observed peak wavelength to z.

Given that the peak is at 790 nm, and assuming it's a rest frame emission line, perhaps the rest frame peak is around 250 nm or something, but that's in the far-ultraviolet, which is unlikely for emission lines.

Wait, another thought. If the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that could be due to the fact that we're seeing the quasar through a lot of intergalactic medium, causing the Lyman-alpha forest absorption, which suppresses the flux at certain wavelengths. But that would be absorption, not a drop in the quasar's own spectrum.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar's rest frame spectrum is such that it doesn't emit much below a certain wavelength, so when redshifted, the observed spectrum peaks at 790 nm, and below that, the flux from the quasar is low.

So, if the rest frame spectrum has a sharp cutoff at λ_rest below which the flux is zero, then in the observed frame, the cutoff is at λ_obs = λ_rest / (1 + z). So, if the observed peak is at 790 nm, the rest frame cutoff would be at λ_rest = 790 (1 + z). But unless we know the rest frame cutoff, we can't get z.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the quasar's rest frame spectrum peaks at a certain wavelength, say λ_peak_rest, and when redshifted, it's observed at 790 nm. So, (1 + z) = 790 / λ_peak_rest. But without knowing λ_peak_rest, we can't get z.

Wait, unless it's that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths because the quasar's rest frame spectrum doesn't have much flux there, implying that the rest frame spectrum doesn't emit much below a certain wavelength, which is redshifted to longer wavelengths in the observed frame. So, if the rest frame spectrum has a minimum wavelength, say λ_min_rest, then in the observed frame, it's at λ_min_obs = λ_min_rest / (1 + z).

But without knowing λ_min_rest, we can't get z.

Wait, perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Maybe the rest frame spectrum of the quasar peaks in the optical, say around 500 nm, and the observed peak is at 790 nm, so z ≈ 1.36 as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's rest frame spectrum peaks at 790 nm, so the redshift z is zero, but that contradicts the flux drop.

Wait, no, the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, so if z were zero, the observed spectrum would match the rest frame, which would have flux dropping at shorter wavelengths, which is not necessarily the case for a typical quasar rest frame.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the quasar is so far away that its rest frame optical light is redshifted into the near-infrared. So, if the rest frame peak is at 500 nm, as before, then z ≈ 1.36, and comoving distance is 9 Gpc.

Therefore, perhaps I can accept that the redshift z is such that the observed peak is 790 nm, and compute the comoving distance accordingly.

But since I don't know the exact rest frame wavelength, perhaps the problem assumes that the redshift is z ≈ 1.36 and then computes the comoving distance as 9 Gpc, given H₀ = 70.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to assume that the quasar's redshift is such that the comoving distance is 9 Gpc, and then relate that to the observed wavelength.

So, let's think about it.

If the comoving distance is D_c = 9 Gpc, and H₀ = 70 km/s/Mpc, then as I did earlier, the integral ∫₀^z 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) dz' ≈ 0.002097.

So, I need to solve for z in:

∫₀^z 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) dz' ≈ 0.002097.

This integral can be approximated numerically. Let me try to compute it numerically step by step.

Let me define f(z) = ∫₀^z [1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7)] dz'

I can use numerical integration techniques, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

Alternatively, since it's a small integral, maybe we can approximate the function.

First, let's write the integrand:

g(z') = 1 / sqrt(0.3(z' + 1)^3 + 0.7)

We can compute this at several points to estimate the integral.

Let me choose a few points and try to approximate.

First, let's try z = 1:

Compute g(0) = 1 / sqrt(0.3(1)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(1) = 1.

g(0.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*3.375 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(1.0125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(1.7125) ≈ 0.577.

g(1) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*8 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(2.4 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(3.1) ≈ 0.516.

g(1.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(2.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*15.625 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(4.6875 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(5.3875) ≈ 0.456.

g(2) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*27 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(8.1 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(8.8) ≈ 0.395.

g(2.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(3.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*42.875 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(12.8625 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(13.5625) ≈ 0.339.

g(3) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(4)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*64 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(19.2 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(19.9) ≈ 0.277.

g(3.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(4.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*91.125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(27.3375 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(28.0375) ≈ 0.226.

g(4) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(37.5 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(38.2) ≈ 0.173.

g(4.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(5.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*166.375 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(49.9125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(50.6125) ≈ 0.131.

g(5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(6)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*216 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(64.8 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(65.5) ≈ 0.092.

g(5.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*274.625 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(83.0875) ≈ 0.070.

g(6) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(7)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*343 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(102.9 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(103.6) ≈ 0.052.

g(6.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(7.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*421.875 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(126.5625 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(127.2625) ≈ 0.035.

g(7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(8)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*512 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(153.6 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(154.3) ≈ 0.024.

g(7.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(8.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*614.125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(184.2375 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(184.9375) ≈ 0.015.

g(8) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(9)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*729 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(218.7 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(219.4) ≈ 0.010.

g(8.5) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(9.5)^3 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*857.375 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(257.3125 + 0.7) = 1 / sqrt(257.0125) ≈ 0.006.

So, these are the function values at various z':

z'=0:1; z'=0.5:0.577; z'=1:0.516; z'=1.5:0.456; z'=2:0.395; z'=2.5:0.339; z'=3:0.277; z'=3.5:0.226; z'=4:0.173; z'=4.5:0.131; z'=5:0.092; z'=5.5:0.070; z'=6:0.052; z'=6.5:0.035; z'=7:0.024; z'=7.5:0.015; z'=8:0.010; z'=8.5:0.006.

Now, let's approximate the integral ∫₀^z g(z') dz' using the trapezoidal rule.

But since I don't know z, perhaps I can use the data points to estimate where the integral equals 0.002097.

Let me try to compute the integral step by step.

First, compute the integral from 0 to 0.5:

Using trapezoidal rule with two intervals (points at 0, 0.5):

Area ≈ (0.5 / 2) * [g(0) + g(0.5)] ≈ 0.25 * [1 + 0.577] ≈ 0.25 * 1.577 ≈ 0.394.

Similarly, from 0 to 1:

With three points: 0, 0.5, 1:

Area ≈ (1 / 2) * [g(0) + 2g(0.5) + g(1)] ≈ 0.5 * [1 + 2*0.577 + 0.516] ≈ 0.5 * [1 + 1.154 + 0.516] ≈ 0.5 * 2.67 ≈ 1.335.

Wait, but we need the integral up to a certain z where I ≈ 0.002097, which is much smaller than 0.394. So, if at z=0.5, the integral is already 0.394, which is much larger than 0.002097, that suggests that the redshift z must be very small. But wait, in our earlier assumption, z was about 1.36, but that gave a much larger integral.

Wait, this seems contradictory. If at z=0.5, the integral is already 0.394, which is much larger than 0.002, then the redshift z must be much less than 0.5. But with z approaching zero, the integral approaches zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Because with Ω_λ = 0.7, even at small z, the integral may not be as small as 0.002.

Wait, perhaps to get a better approximation, I can compute the integral for small z.

Since for small z, we can expand the function g(z') as:

g(z') = 1 / sqrt(0.3(1 + z')³ + 0.7) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z'(1 + 3 z' + ...)) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z' + 0.9 z'^2 + ...).

So, up to first order:

g(z') ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z').

Then, the integral becomes:

I ≈ ∫₀^z 1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z') dz' ≈ ∫₀^z (1 / sqrt(0.7)) * [1 / sqrt(1 + (0.3 / 0.7) z')]^{-1} dz'

Wait, let me think. Let me write it as:

Let me factor out 0.7:

sqrt(0.7 + 0.3 z') = sqrt(0.7(1 + (0.3 / 0.7) z')) = sqrt(0.7) * sqrt(1 + (3/7) z').

Therefore, g(z') = 1 / [sqrt(0.7) * sqrt(1 + (3/7) z')} ] ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.7) * [1 - (3/14) z'].

Using the expansion sqrt(1 + ε) ≈ 1 + ε/2 for small ε.

Therefore, g(z') ≈ (1 / sqrt(0.7)) * [1 - (3/14) z'].

Thus, the integral I ≈ ∫₀^z (1 / sqrt(0.7)) [1 - (3/14) z'] dz' = (1 / sqrt(0.7)) [ z - (3/14) * (z²)/2 ] = (1 / sqrt(0.7)) [ z - (3/28) z² ].

We need this to be equal to 0.002097:

(1 / sqrt(0.7)) [ z - (3/28) z² ] ≈ 0.002097.

Compute 1 / sqrt(0.7) ≈ 1 / 0.8367 ≈ 1.194.

Thus:

1.194 [ z - (3/28) z² ] ≈ 0.002097

Divide both sides by 1.194:

z - (3/28) z² ≈ 0.002097 / 1.194 ≈ 0.00175.

So:

z - (3/28) z
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth is 9 gigaparsecs (Gpc). Let me start by recalling what I know about comoving distances and the Lambda-CDM model.

First off, the comoving distance is a measure of how far away an object is, taking into account the expansion of the universe. It's the distance that would be measured if the expansion of the universe wasn't happening, meaning we're essentially freezing the expansion at the time the light left the object. This distance is important because it tells us about the large-scale structure of the universe and helps us understand how far away objects are from us in a "comoving" sense.

The problem mentions that the quasar has a peak in the near-infrared and optical spectrum at around 790 nm. It also says that at shorter wavelengths (i.e., higher energy), the flux drops significantly. I think this has to do with the quasar's emission. The peak at 790 nm is probably the rest wavelength of some feature, like the emission line from hydrogen atoms in the quasar's vicinity. The fact that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths suggests that there's a cutoff, maybe due to absorption by intervening gas or dust, but since the peak is around 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, that makes sense because quasars often have broad emission features in this range.

Now, the universe parameters are given as:
- Hubble constant, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1} \),
- Matter density parameter, \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \),
- Dark energy density parameter, \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \),
- And the universe is flat, so \( \Omega_k = 0 \).

Since the universe is flat, that tells us that the total matter plus dark energy plus dark matter must add up to 1 in terms of their density parameters. Here, \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), so \( \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0 \), which makes sense because the universe is flat.

Now, to find the comoving distance, I remember that it's given by the integral:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz
\]

Where \( z \) is the redshift of the quasar. Since the question mentions the quasar's peak is at 790 nm, and in a universe without expansion, that wavelength would be the same as the rest wavelength. However, due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength we observe is stretched by a factor of \( (1+z) \). So, if the rest wavelength is \( \lambda_0 \), we observe \( \lambda = \lambda_0 (1+z) \). 

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the rest wavelength corresponding to the 790 nm peak. It just says that the peak is at 790 nm. Hmm, so does that mean 790 nm is the observed wavelength, or the rest wavelength? If it's the observed wavelength, then we can find \( z \) by dividing by the rest wavelength. If not, we have to assume it's the rest wavelength, which would mean \( \lambda_{obs} = 790 \times (1+z) \).

But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume that 790 nm is the rest wavelength. Alternatively, if it's the observed wavelength, then we need to know the rest wavelength to compute \( z \). Since the problem doesn't give that, maybe we're supposed to use a standard quasar emission line, like Lyman-alpha or something else.

Wait, perhaps the 790 nm peak is the rest wavelength. So if that's the case, then the observed wavelength is longer. But without knowing the rest wavelength, we can't compute the redshift. Hmm, now I'm confused. Wait, maybe the 790 nm is the observed wavelength, and the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 500 nm or something. Or maybe it's a specific line. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 790 nm is the rest wavelength, but I don't know the exact value. Maybe the question is more about the cosmological parameters? Since it says, "what can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance... Why the correct answer is: 9 Gpc?"

So perhaps the question is more about how to compute the comoving distance given the redshift, using the Lambda-CDM parameters.

But without knowing the redshift, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is a specific feature that tells us about the redshift. If the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm, then the redshift z would be 790 / 500 = 1.58. Then we can compute the comoving distance.

Alternatively, if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (which is the Lyman-alpha wavelength for hydrogen), then z would be 790 / 121 ≈ 6.54.

Wait, 121 nm is in the far-UV. If the quasar's peak is observed at 790 nm, that suggests that the rest wavelength is shorter, so z is about 790 / rest wavelength. So depending on the rest wavelength, z can vary. But unless we have that, we can't directly compute z.

But perhaps the question is just expecting us to know that at a redshift corresponding to a comoving distance of 9 Gpc, given the cosmological parameters, and perhaps that redshift is about 1.5 or something.

Alternatively, maybe the 790 nm is the rest wavelength, which is in the near-infrared. If the quasar's rest frame has a peak at 790 nm, then the observed wavelength is longer, so the redshift is such that 790*(1+z) = observed wavelength.

But since the problem doesn't give us the observed wavelength, perhaps it's just using 790 nm as the rest wavelength, so z=0? No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about what comoving distance is. It's the integral of the inverse of the Hubble parameter over redshift. So with the given parameters, we can compute the integral numerically. But without knowing z, we can't do that.

But wait, the question is about what can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance. So perhaps it's expecting us to know a standard value for a quasar at a certain redshift.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar's redshift can be inferred from the peak wavelength. If the peak is at 790 nm, and assuming it's the rest wavelength, then the observed wavelength is longer, but without knowing what it is, we can't get the redshift.

Wait, hold on. The question says, "observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly."

This suggests that the peak is observed at 790 nm. So, in the rest frame, what would that wavelength be? If the quasar is emitting light with a peak at a shorter wavelength, say in the optical, which gets redshifted to near-infrared due to the expansion of the universe.

So, if the peak in the rest frame is in the optical, say 500 nm, then the observed wavelength would be 790 nm, so the redshift z is 790 / 500 ≈ 1.58.

With z ≈ 1.58, we can compute the comoving distance.

Alternatively, if the rest wavelength is 300 nm (which is in the far-UV), then z would be 790 / 300 ≈ 2.63.

But since quasars often have Lyman-alpha emission lines around 121 nm, which is UV. If the rest wavelength is 121 nm, then z ≈ 790 / 121 ≈ 6.54.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, we can't know z.

Wait, perhaps the 790 nm is the rest wavelength? If so, then z=0, which would mean the quasar is right next to us. But that doesn't make sense because the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, implying that we're seeing a redshifted spectrum.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar's rest wavelength is in a different part of the spectrum. Maybe it's the Lyman limit or something.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in the observed spectrum, the peak is at 790 nm, but in the rest frame, it's shorter. So, if the rest wavelength is λ0, then observed wavelength is λ0*(1+z)=790. So, z=(790 / λ0) -1.

But without λ0, we can't compute z.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is the red end of the quasar's spectrum, which implies that at shorter wavelengths (lower λ, higher energy), the flux drops, which is typical of quasars. So maybe the 790 nm is the rest wavelength for the peak. If that's the case, then the quasar is at z=0, which can't be because then the flux wouldn't drop. So maybe it's the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the quasar is so far away that its light is redshifted into the near-infrared. So, for example, if the rest wavelength is 500 nm, then z=790/500≈1.58, which is a moderate redshift.

Alternatively, if the rest wavelength is 300 nm, z≈2.63.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, it's impossible to get z.

Wait, but the question is about what can be assumed about the comoving distance. Maybe it's a standard quasar redshift, so a comoving distance of 9 Gpc is a typical value. But why 9 Gpc?

Wait, 9 Gpc is about 9 gigaparsecs. 1 Gpc is 3,262 million parsecs, so 9 Gpc is a very large distance.

For a quasar, the comoving distance would depend on its redshift. For example, for z≈1, comoving distance is roughly 7 Gpc, but for higher z, it's more.

Wait, let me recall that in a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the comoving distance for a given redshift z can be computed numerically. The integral is:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Where \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( H_0 \) is the Hubble constant.

Given \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \).

To compute \( D_c \), I need to integrate from 0 to z, with the integrand being \( 1 / \sqrt{0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7} \).

But without knowing z, I can't compute it. So perhaps the question is implying that the redshift z is such that the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc, given the parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the 790 nm is the rest wavelength, so z=0, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the 790 nm is the observed wavelength, and if the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm (in the optical), then z≈1.58. Then, plugging into the comoving distance formula with the given parameters, what do we get?

Let me try to compute that.

First, let's convert all units to consistent SI units.

\( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} = 70,000 \, \text{m/s/Mpc} \times \frac{1 \, \text{Mpc}}{1e6 \, \text{km}} = 70e3 m/s/Mpc × 1e6 km/Mpc = 70e9 m/s/Mpc.

Wait, no, actually, 1 Mpc = 1e6 km, so 70 km/s/Mpc is 70,000 m/s/Mpc.

But more accurately, 1 parsec = 3.26 light-years ≈ 3.08e16 meters. So 1 Mpc = 1e6 parsec ≈ 3.08e22 meters.

So, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} = 70e3 \, \text{m/s/Mpc} \).

But to compute the integral, which is in units of comoving distance, I can use the proper units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use all units in terms of Mpc and Gpc.

Given that 1 Gpc = 1e9 Mpc.

But I need to express the integral in terms of comoving distance, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of comoving distance in units of Mpc.

So, let's rewrite the integral:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
\]

But c is in terms of Mpc per unit time. Let me get all the constants right.

First, let's compute c in terms of Mpc/s.

1 parsec = 3.26 light-years ≈ 3.08e16 meters.

1 Mpc = 1e6 parsec ≈ 3.08e22 meters.

1 light-year ≈ 9.46e15 meters.

So, speed of light c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

Therefore, in terms of Mpc/s:

c = 3e8 m/s / (3.08e22 m/Mpc) ≈ 9.74e-15 Mpc/s.

Wait, that seems too small. Wait, no, 3e8 / 3.08e22 is approximately 9.74e-15 Mpc/s. Hmm, that seems off.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1 Mpc = 1e6 parsec = 1e6 * 3.08e16 m ≈ 3.08e22 m.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So, c = 3e8 m/s / 3.08e22 m/Mpc ≈ (3 / 3.08) * 1e-14 Mpc/s ≈ 0.971 * 1e-14 Mpc/s ≈ 9.71e-15 Mpc/s.

So, c ≈ 9.71e-15 Mpc/s.

But that seems really small. Wait, 1 pc/year is about 3.26 light-years/year ≈ 9.46e15 m/year. So, c in pc/year is 3e8 m/s / 3.15e7 m/year ≈ 9.52 pc/year.

Therefore, c ≈ 9.52 pc/year.

1 Mpc = 1e6 pc, so c ≈ 9.52e-6 Mpc/year.

To get c in Mpc/s, we need to convert seconds to years: 1 year ≈ 3.15e7 seconds.

So, c ≈ 9.52e-6 Mpc/year * 3.15e7 s/year ≈ 9.52e-6 * 3.15e7 ≈ 3e-5 Mpc/s.

Wait, so c ≈ 3e-5 Mpc/s.

But H_0 is given in km/s/Mpc, so 70 km/s/Mpc is 70,000 m/s/Mpc.

Wait, 1 km = 1e3 m, so 70 km = 70e3 m.

Therefore, H_0 = 70,000 m/s/Mpc.

So, now, \( H_0 = 70,000 \, \text{m/s/Mpc} \).

So, \( \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3e-5 Mpc/s}{7e4 m/s/Mpc} \).

But wait, the units don't match because c is in Mpc/s and H_0 is in m/s/Mpc.

So, to make them compatible, we need to convert H_0 to Mpc/s.

Given H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc = 70,000 m/s/Mpc.

But 1 Mpc = 3.08e22 m, so 1 m = 3.24e-22 Mpc.

Therefore, H_0 = 70,000 m/s / (3.08e22 m/Mpc) ≈ 70,000 / 3.08e22 * s^-1 Mpc.

So, H_0 ≈ 2.27e-18 s^-1 Mpc.

Therefore, \( H_0 \) is 2.27e-18 Mpc per second.

Similarly, c ≈ 3e-5 Mpc/s.

Thus, \( \frac{c}{H_0} ≈ \frac{3e-5}{2.27e-18} ≈ 1.328e12 \).

So, \( \frac{c}{H_0} ≈ 1.328e12 \) Mpc.

Now, the integral in the comoving distance formula is:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
\]

So, the integral is multiplied by 1.328e12 Mpc.

Let me write down the integral:

\[
I = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7}} \, dz'
\]

I need to compute this integral for a given z.

But since the problem doesn't give z, maybe we can assume that z is such that D_c ≈ 9 Gpc.

Since 1 Gpc = 1e9 Mpc, 9 Gpc = 9e9 Mpc.

Given that \( \frac{c}{H_0} ≈ 1.328e12 \) Mpc, so:

\( D_c = 1.328e12 \times I = 9e9 \)

Thus, I ≈ 9e9 / 1.328e12 ≈ 6.78e-4.

So, the integral I ≈ 0.000678.

So, \( I = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7}} \, dz' ≈ 0.000678 \).

We need to solve for z such that this integral equals approximately 0.000678.

This integral is a bit tricky analytically, but we can approximate it numerically.

Let me think about how to compute this.

We can note that for a given z, the integral can be computed numerically. Since we don't have a calculator here, perhaps we can use some approximations.

But perhaps the integral is approximately equal to 1/(H0 times something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe for small z, the integral can be approximated.

Wait, if z is small, say z < 1, then (1+z')^3 ≈ 1 + 3z', so we can approximate the integral as:

\[
I ≈ \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.3(1 + 3z') + 0.7}} \, dz' = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.0 + 0.9 z'}} \, dz'
\]

But 0.3*(1+3z') + 0.7 = 0.3 + 0.9 z' + 0.7 = 1.0 + 0.9 z'.

So, for small z, this reduces to:

\[
I ≈ \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 0.9 z'}} \, dz'
\]

Let me make a substitution: let t = 0.9 z', so dz' = dt / 0.9.

Then, the integral becomes:

\[
I ≈ \int_{0}^{0.9 z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t}} \cdot \frac{dt}{0.9} = \frac{1}{0.9} \int_{0}^{0.9 z} (1 + t)^{-1/2} dt = \frac{1}{0.9} [ 2 \sqrt{1 + t} ]_{0}^{0.9 z} = \frac{2}{0.9} [ \sqrt{1 + 0.9 z} - 1 ]
\]

So, for small z, I ≈ (2 / 0.9)(sqrt(1 + 0.9 z) - 1 )

If z is not too large, say z < 1, this approximation might hold.

But earlier, we found that I ≈ 0.000678.

So, let's set up the equation:

(2 / 0.9)(sqrt(1 + 0.9 z) - 1 ) ≈ 0.000678

Compute 2 / 0.9 ≈ 2.222

So,

2.222 (sqrt(1 + 0.9 z) - 1 ) ≈ 0.000678

Divide both sides by 2.222:

sqrt(1 + 0.9 z) - 1 ≈ 0.000678 / 2.222 ≈ 0.000305

Add 1:

sqrt(1 + 0.9 z) ≈ 1.000305

Square both sides:

1 + 0.9 z ≈ (1.000305)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.000305 = 1.00061

Subtract 1:

0.9 z ≈ 0.00061

So, z ≈ 0.00061 / 0.9 ≈ 0.00068.

So, z ≈ 0.00068.

Wait, but that's a very small redshift, about 0.068%. That seems too small for a quasar, which usually have higher redshifts.

Moreover, if z is 0.00068, that's a very nearby quasar, which contradicts the fact that flux drops at shorter wavelengths (implying significant redshift).

Therefore, my assumption that z is small is invalid here.

So, maybe the redshift is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral approximation.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach.

I recall that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the integral for comoving distance can be expressed in terms of the function E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

For Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, E(z) = sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

I think that for high redshifts, when matter dominates, the integral can be approximated differently.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a look-up table or standard value.

But perhaps I can think about the age of the universe and how it relates to comoving distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance for z=1.5 is about 7 Gpc, and for z=2, it's about 10 Gpc. So, 9 Gpc would be somewhere around z=1.8 or so.

But without exact values, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the comoving distance of 9 Gpc is a standard value.

Wait, I think that in the Lambda-CDM model, a comoving distance of approximately 9 Gpc corresponds to a redshift of about z ≈ 1.7 to z=2.

So, perhaps the quasar is at such a redshift, hence the comoving distance is about 9 Gpc.

But how does that relate to the 790 nm peak?

Wait, if the 790 nm is the observed wavelength, and in the rest frame, it's a shorter wavelength, say in the optical, then z≈790 / rest wavelength -1.

If the rest wavelength is, say, 500 nm, then z≈1.58.

At z≈1.58, what's the comoving distance?

Using the integral I mentioned earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use an approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy.

I recall that in such a universe, the comoving distance can be expressed as:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \ln \left( \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{\Omega_m} + \sqrt{\Omega_Λ}}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}}} + \frac{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_Λ}}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \right)
\]

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the lookback time or other methods.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for comoving distance in terms of E(z):

We can use the function E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

Then, the integral for comoving distance is:

\[
D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{E(z')} dz'
\]

This integral doesn't have a closed-form solution, so we have to evaluate it numerically.

Given that I don't have a calculator, I can try to estimate it.

Let me define f(z) = 1 / E(z).

Given Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7.

Let me compute f(z) at various z:

For z=0:

E(0) = sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) = 1. So f(0)=1.

For z=1:

E(1)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 + 0.7)=sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)≈1.761. So f(1)=1/1.761≈0.568.

For z=2:

E(2)=sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)≈2.966. So f(2)=1/2.966≈0.337.

For z=3:

E(3)=sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)≈4.467. So f(3)=1/4.467≈0.224.

For z=4:

E(4)=sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)=sqrt(37.5 +0.7)=sqrt(38.2)≈6.176. So f(4)=1/6.176≈0.162.

For z=5:

E(5)=sqrt(0.3*625 +0.7)=sqrt(187.5 +0.7)=sqrt(188.2)≈13.74. f(5)=1/13.74≈0.0728.

So, the function f(z) decreases as z increases.

Given that, to compute the integral ∫_{0}^{z} f(z') dz', we can approximate it using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

Given that f(z) is a monotonically decreasing function, we can use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.

But without specific z, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the age of the universe.

Wait, the age of the universe at redshift z is:

\[
t(z) = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{H(z')} dz'
\]

Where H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

So, the age t(z) is similar to D_c, except D_c = c * t(z).

So, if D_c ≈9 Gpc, then t(z)= D_c / c ≈9e9 Mpc / (3e5 km/s) * (conversion factors).

Wait, let's compute c in Mpc/s:

c ≈3e8 m/s / (3.08e22 m/Mpc) ≈9.74e-15 Mpc/s.

So, D_c = c * t(z) => t(z) = D_c / c ≈9e9 / 9.74e-15 ≈9.24e23 seconds.

But the age of the universe now is about 1.38e10 years (from Planck data). Let me check:

1 year ≈3.15e7 seconds.

So, 1.38e10 years ≈1.38e10 * 3.15e7 ≈4.37e17 seconds.

Given that t(z)=9.24e23 seconds, which is way larger than the age of the universe now, which is impossible because the universe is only about 1.4e10 years old.

Wait, this suggests that D_c=9 Gpc would correspond to a much higher z, but since the age of the universe is limited, we must have D_c less than a certain value.

Wait, I think I messed up the units.

Wait, D_c is 9 Gpc, which is 9e9 Mpc.

But c is 3e5 km/s, which is 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s.

But to get D_c in terms of Mpc, we need to convert c to Mpc/s.

1 Mpc = 3.08e22 m.

So, c = 3e8 m/s / 3.08e22 m/Mpc ≈9.74e-15 Mpc/s.

Therefore, D_c = c * t(z) =9.74e-15 Mpc/s * t(z seconds).

So, t(z) = D_c / (9.74e-15) Mpc/s.

So for D_c=9e9 Mpc,

t(z)=9e9 / 9.74e-15 ≈9.24e23 seconds.

Convert seconds to years:

1 year ≈3.15e7 seconds.

So, t(z)=9.24e23 /3.15e7 ≈2.94e16 years.

But that's way more than the age of the universe (≈1.4e10 years), which is impossible.

Therefore, D_c cannot be 9 Gpc because the universe isn't old enough.

Wait, but the question says, "the correct answer is: 9 Gpc." So perhaps the question is assuming a different cosmology or I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the unit conversions.

Wait, let me check the Hubble constant:

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

So, H0 in s^-1 is 70 km/s/Mpc * (1 s / 1 km) * (1 Mpc / 1e6 km) =70 *1e-3 *1e-6 =7e-8 s^-1.

Wait, 70 km/s/Mpc =70,000 m/s / Mpc.

1 Mpc =1e6 km=1e6 *1e3 m=1e9 m.

So, H0=70,000 m/s / 1e9 m =70e3 /1e9=7e-5 1/s.

Wait, that's 7e-5 s^-1.

So, H0=7e-5 s^-1.

Therefore, c=3e8 m/s=3e8 /1e9 Mpc/s=3e-1 Mpc/s.

So, c=0.3 Mpc/s.

Thus, c/H0=0.3 /7e-5 ≈4.2857e3 Mpc.

So, the integral is multiplied by 4.2857e3 Mpc.

Earlier, I thought c/H0 was about 1.3e12, but that was incorrect.

Wait, let's get the units correct.

c=3e8 m/s.

But 1 Mpc=1e9 m.

So, c=3e8 m/s /1e9 m/Mpc=3e-1 Mpc/s.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc=70,000 m/s / Mpc.

But 1 Mpc=1e9 m, so H0=70,000 m/s /1e9 m=7e-5 s^-1.

Thus, c/H0=0.3 Mpc/s / (7e-5 s^-1)=0.3 /7e-5≈4285.7 Mpc.

Yes, so c/H0≈4285.7 Mpc.

Therefore, D_c=4285.7 Mpc * integral I.

So, if D_c=9 Gpc=9e9 Mpc,

Then, I=9e9 /4285.7≈2100.

So, I≈2100.

So, the integral ∫_{0}^{z} f(z')dz' ≈2100.

But wait, earlier when I computed f(z) at z=1, f=0.568.

At z=2, f=0.337.

At z=3, f=0.224.

At z=4, f=0.162.

At z=5, f=0.0728.

So, the integral from 0 to z is the area under the curve.

Given that, let's approximate the integral I=∫_{0}^{z} f(z')dz'≈2100.

But wait, 2100 is a huge value. Because for z=1, integral is about ∫0^1 1/E(z')dz'≈?

Wait, no, let me compute the integral correctly.

Wait, D_c= c/H0 * ∫_{0}^{z} 1/E(z') dz' =4285.7 Mpc * ∫_{0}^{z} 1/E(z') dz'.

So, if D_c=9e9 Mpc, then ∫=9e9 /4285.7≈2100.

So, the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz'≈2100.

But looking at the values:

At z=0, E=1, f=1.

From z=0 to z=1, f decreases from 1 to 0.568.

The average f over z=0 to1 is (1 +0.568)/2=0.784. So, integral≈0.784*1≈0.784.

Similarly, from z=1 to2, f from 0.568 to0.337, average≈0.4525. Integral≈0.4525*1≈0.4525.

From z=2 to3, f from0.337 to0.224, average≈0.2805. Integral≈0.2805.

From z=3 to4, f from0.224 to0.162, average≈0.193. Integral≈0.193.

From z=4 to5, f from0.162 to0.0728, average≈0.1174. Integral≈0.1174.

So, total integral up to z=5 is≈0.784 +0.4525 +0.2805 +0.193 +0.1174≈2.0274.

But we need the integral to be≈2100, which is way more.

Wait, that suggests that z is extremely large, which can't be because the universe isn't that old.

Wait, I think I messed up the units again.

Wait, no. The integral I is ∫0^z [1/E(z')] dz'.

E(z)=sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 +0.7).

But E(z) is unitless. So, the integral is unitless.

But D_c= c/H0 * I.

Given that, and with c/H0=4285.7 Mpc, and D_c=9e9 Mpc,

I=9e9 /4285.7≈2100.

So, the integral I=2100.

But for z up to 5, the integral is only≈2.0274.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, no, the integral is ∫0^z [1/E(z')] dz', which is dimensionless.

But in reality,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The peak wavelength is around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths than that. The question is asking what we can assume about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth in a universe with specific parameters: Hubble constant (H0) is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter (Omega_m) is 0.3, dark energy density parameter (Omega_lambda) is 0.7, and the universe is flat. The suggested answer is 9 Gpc, but I need to figure out why that's the case.

First, let me recall what a comoving distance is. From what I remember, comoving distance is like the distance a light ray would travel in the expanding universe. It's a measure that accounts for the expansion of the universe over time. So, if we observe an object at a certain redshift, the comoving distance tells us how far away it is, considering the universe's expansion.

Given that the quasar has a peak wavelength of 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, I think this is related to the rest-frame spectrum. When a quasar emits light, it has a peak in its emission. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, we can use this to find the redshift of the quasar.

Wait, so if the peak is at 790 nm, and assuming that in the quasar's rest frame, the peak is at a different wavelength, say lambda_rest, then the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to lambda_rest by the redshift z. The relation is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So, if I can figure out lambda_rest, I can find z, and then use that to find the comoving distance.

But I don't know the rest wavelength of the peak. Hmm. Maybe I need to think about the quasar's properties. The peak in the quasar's spectrum is often due to the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. The peak emission is around the rest-frame UV or optical. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is near-infrared, then that suggests that the rest-frame peak is in the optical or near-infrared. 

But without knowing the exact rest wavelength, how can I find z? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths implies that the peak is at 790 nm, and that the quasar's spectrum is such that beyond that, the flux decreases. But I'm not sure how that helps me.

Wait, maybe I need to use the fact that the peak wavelength is redshifted into the observed near-infrared. So, if I assume that the rest-frame peak is at, say, 300 nm (which is UV), then the redshift z would be lambda_obs / lambda_rest - 1 = 790 / 300 - 1 = approximately 2.63 - 1 = 1.63. So, z ≈ 1.63. Then, using the Hubble constant and the parameters, I can compute the comoving distance.

But wait, is 300 nm a good assumption for the rest wavelength? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the quasar's SED. Quasars typically have a big blue bump in their rest-frame spectrum, which is around 100-300 nm. So, if in the rest frame, the peak is around 300 nm, then the observed wavelength of 790 nm would correspond to a redshift of about 2.63 - 1 = 1.63, as I had earlier.

Alternatively, if the peak is in the rest-frame near-infrared, maybe around 1000 nm? Then, 790 / 1000 = 0.79, so 0.79 - 1 = -0.21. Wait, that can't be right because redshift can't be negative. So, that suggests that the rest-frame peak must be in the UV.

So, I think it's safer to assume that the rest-frame peak is around 300 nm. So, z ≈ 1.63.

Now, with the redshift z, I can compute the comoving distance D_C. The formula for comoving distance is:

D_C = c * (1 + z) * integral from 0 to z of 1 / E(z') dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1 + z)^(-3*Omega_m/(1 + Omega_m)))}, but wait, that seems a bit complicated. Or maybe I can use the lookback time function, but comoving distance is different.

Actually, the comoving distance D_C is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z [1 / E(z')]^{-1} dz'

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (1 + z) * (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z [1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1 + z')^{-3*omega_m/(1 + omega_m)})] dz'

Wait, the E(z) is defined as sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1 + z)^{-3*omega_m/(1 + omega_m)}). So, E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1 + z)^{-3*(0.3)/(1 + 0.3)}) )

Wait, maybe I should write E(z) as sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^(-3* Om_m/(1 + Om_m)))} ?

Wait, actually, I think the correct expression is E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3*(Omega_m/(1 + Omega_m))}).

But Omega_m/(1 + Omega_m) is 0.3 / 1.3 ≈ 0.2308.

So, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + z)^3 + 0.7*(1 + z)^(-3*0.2308)).

Simplify the exponent: -3*0.2308 ≈ -0.6924.

So, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + z)^3 + 0.7*(1 + z)^{-0.6924}).

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but perhaps manageable.

So, now, with z ≈ 1.63, I need to compute the integral from 0 to z of 1 / E(z') dz'.

But integrating 1/E(z') is not straightforward. I might need to approximate it numerically or use some standard values.

Wait, I remember that for certain values of z and parameters, comoving distances can be looked up or approximated using standard tables or formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximation formula for the comoving distance. Let me recall that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated, but I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, I can consider using the age of the universe or the lookback time, but comoving distance is different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between comoving distance and the luminosity distance, but I don't know the luminosity distance either.

Wait, maybe I can use the function for comoving distance in terms of z. For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the integral for comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_{0}^{z} [1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1 + z')^{-3*Om_m/(1 + Om_m)})] dz'

But this integral doesn't have a closed-form solution, so we need to compute it numerically or use approximations.

Alternatively, I can look for tables or approximate values for comoving distances in different z for given parameters.

Wait, I also recall that for a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy, at low redshifts (z < 1), the comoving distance can be approximated by a certain formula, but for higher redshifts, like z around 1.6, it might be a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance in terms of z:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * ( (1 + z) * [1 + 0.5 * (1 - Omega_m - 2*Omega_lambda) * z ] )

Wait, is that right? I'm not sure. Maybe that's a different distance.

Wait, perhaps I should instead refer to standard cosmology calculators. But since I can't access that right now, I need to figure it out step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy:

D_C = (c / H0) * f(z; Omega_m, Omega_lambda)

Where f(z; Omega_m, Omega_lambda) is an integral that can be approximated.

I found in some notes that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be written as:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (1 + z) * integral_{0}^{z} [1 / E(z')]^{-1} dz' ]

Wait, no, that's not correct because E(z) is already sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3*(Omega_m/(1 + Omega_m))} ), so 1/E(z) is 1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3*(Omega_m/(1 + Omega_m))} )

So, integrating 1/E(z) from 0 to z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the lookback time function, which is the integral of 1/E(z) from 0 to z, which is the same as the age of the universe at redshift z divided by the age now. But that's lookback time, not comoving distance.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the relation between comoving distance and lookback time.

Wait, no. The lookback time is the integral of 1/E(z) from 0 to z, which is the same as the age difference between now and when the light was emitted. The comoving distance is the integral of c/(E(z)) dz from 0 to z.

Wait, no, comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c / E(z') dz'.

Wait, yes, because E(z) is the expansion rate (comoving) at redshift z, so the differential comoving distance is c / E(z). Therefore, integrating that from 0 to z gives the total comoving distance.

So, D_C = c * ∫_{0}^{z} [1 / E(z')] dz'

Which is the same as c times the lookback time. So, yes, D_C = c * lookback time.

But since lookback time is often expressed as a function of z, and integrating 1/E(z) is not trivial.

Given that, perhaps I can approximate the integral numerically.

So, let's try to compute D_C for z ≈ 1.63.

First, let's note the parameters:

Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_lambda = 0.7, flat universe.

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + z)^3 + 0.7*(1 + z)^(-3*(0.3/(1 + 0.3)))) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + z)^3 + 0.7*(1 + z)^(-0.6924))

So, let's compute E(z) at various points between z=0 to z=1.63.

But this is going to take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can find approximate values or use a series expansion.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for the integral.

Wait, I found an approximate formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * ( (2.2 / (1 + z)) + (0.15 * (1 + z)) )

But I'm not sure if this is accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps another approximation.

Wait, I found that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at redshift z can be approximated by:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * (1.78 + 0.64 z + 0.12 z^2 + 0.23 z^3)

But I don't know the source of this formula, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me try to set up a numerical integration.

Let me divide the integral from 0 to z into several steps. Let's say I'll take steps from z=0 to z=1.63, compute E(z) at each step, sum up the 1/E(z) and multiply by c.

Wait, let's note that H0 is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. So, c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So, c / H0 is approximately 3e5 / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

But let me compute it more accurately:

c = 3 x 10^5 km/s

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc

So, c / H0 = (3e5) / 70 ≈ 4285.714 Mpc

So, 1 unit of the integral in Mpc is 4285.714 Mpc.

Now, let's approximate the integral ∫_{0}^{1.63} 1/E(z) dz.

We can do this by using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule with several intervals.

Let me first compute E(z) at several points:

1. z = 0:

E(0) = sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 + 0.7*(1)^(-0.6924)) = sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 / (1 + 0.6924)) = sqrt(0.3 + 0.7 / 1.6924) ≈ sqrt(0.3 + 0.413) ≈ sqrt(0.713) ≈ 0.844

2. z = 0.5:

E(0.5) = sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 + 0.7*(1.5)^(-0.6924))

Compute each term:

0.3*(3.375) = 1.0125

0.7*(1.5)^(-0.6924) ≈ 0.7 / (1.5^0.6924)

Compute 1.5^0.6924:

ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

0.6924 * ln(1.5) ≈ 0.6924*0.4055 ≈ 0.280

Exponentiate: e^0.280 ≈ 1.324

So, 1.5^0.6924 ≈ 1.324

So, 0.7 / 1.324 ≈ 0.530

Therefore, E(0.5) ≈ sqrt(1.0125 + 0.530) ≈ sqrt(1.5425) ≈ 1.241

3. z = 1.0:

E(1.0) = sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 + 0.7*(2)^(-0.6924))

Compute each term:

0.3*8 = 2.4

0.7*2^(-0.6924) ≈ 0.7 / (2^0.6924)

Compute 2^0.6924:

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

0.6924 * ln(2) ≈ 0.6924*0.6931 ≈ 0.480

Exponentiate: e^0.480 ≈ 1.616

So, 2^0.6924 ≈ 1.616

Therefore, 0.7 / 1.616 ≈ 0.433

So, E(1.0) ≈ sqrt(2.4 + 0.433) ≈ sqrt(2.833) ≈ 1.683

4. z = 1.5:

E(1.5) = sqrt(0.3*(2.5)^3 + 0.7*(2.5)^(-0.6924))

Compute each term:

0.3*15.625 = 4.6875

0.7*2.5^(-0.6924) ≈ 0.7 / (2.5^0.6924)

Compute 2.5^0.6924:

ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163

0.6924*ln(2.5) ≈ 0.6924*0.9163 ≈ 0.634

Exponentiate: e^0.634 ≈ 1.884

So, 2.5^0.6924 ≈ 1.884

Therefore, 0.7 / 1.884 ≈ 0.372

So, E(1.5) ≈ sqrt(4.6875 + 0.372) ≈ sqrt(5.0595) ≈ 2.247

5. z = 1.6:

E(1.6) = sqrt(0.3*(2.6)^3 + 0.7*(2.6)^(-0.6924))

Compute:

0.3*17.576 = 5.2728

0.7*2.6^(-0.6924) ≈ 0.7 / (2.6^0.6924)

Compute 2.6^0.6924:

ln(2.6) ≈ 0.9555

0.6924*ln(2.6) ≈ 0.6924*0.9555 ≈ 0.659

Exponentiate: e^0.659 ≈ 1.931

Therefore, 2.6^0.6924 ≈ 1.931

So, 0.7 / 1.931 ≈ 0.362

Thus, E(1.6) ≈ sqrt(5.2728 + 0.362) ≈ sqrt(5.635) ≈ 2.376

6. z = 1.63:

E(1.63) = sqrt(0.3*(2.63)^3 + 0.7*(2.63)^(-0.6924))

Compute:

0.3*(17.92) ≈ 5.376

0.7*2.63^(-0.6924) ≈ 0.7 / (2.63^0.6924)

Compute 2.63^0.6924:

ln(2.63) ≈ 0.974

0.6924*ln(2.63) ≈ 0.6924*0.974 ≈ 0.675

Exponentiate: e^0.675 ≈ 1.965

Thus, 2.63^0.6924 ≈ 1.965

Therefore, 0.7 / 1.965 ≈ 0.356

So, E(1.63) ≈ sqrt(5.376 + 0.356) ≈ sqrt(5.732) ≈ 2.394

So, summarizing E(z) at various z:

z | E(z)
---|---
0 | 0.844
0.5 | 1.241
1.0 | 1.683
1.5 | 2.247
1.6 | 2.376
1.63 | 2.394

Now, to approximate the integral ∫_{0}^{1.63} 1/E(z) dz, let's use the trapezoidal rule with several intervals.

Let's divide the interval from z=0 to z=1.63 into several steps. Let's choose 4 intervals for simplicity, but perhaps 5.

Wait, actually, let's use more points for better accuracy. Let's take z=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 1.63.

Wait, but that's a bit too many. Maybe 4 intervals.

Wait, actually, perhaps use the Simpson's rule for better accuracy.

Simpson's rule states that ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx ≈ (Δx/3) [f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + ... + 2f(x_{n-2}) + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(xn)] where n is even.

Given that, let's do Simpson's rule with n=4 intervals (so 5 points).

But wait, the points need to be equally spaced. The range is from z=0 to z=1.63, so Δz = 1.63 / 4 ≈ 0.4075.

But that would mean points at z=0, 0.4075, 0.815, 1.2225, 1.63.

But wait, I already have E(z) at some points, but not at all these points. So, maybe it's better to create a table with more points.

Let me take more points for better approximation.

Let me choose n=8 intervals, so Δz = 1.63 / 8 ≈ 0.20375.

So, let's compute E(z) at z=0, 0.20375, 0.4075, 0.61125, 0.815, 1.01875, 1.2225, 1.42625, 1.63.

Compute E(z) for each:

1. z=0: E=0.844
2. z=0.20375: compute E(0.20375)
   - (1 + z)=1.20375
   - 0.3*(1.20375)^3 ≈ 0.3*(1.737) ≈ 0.521
   - 0.7*(1.20375)^(-0.6924)
      - Compute 1.20375^0.6924
         - ln(1.20375) ≈ 0.180
         - 0.6924*0.180 ≈ 0.1245
         - e^0.1245 ≈ 1.132
      - So, 0.7 / 1.132 ≈ 0.619
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(0.521 + 0.619) ≈ sqrt(1.14) ≈ 1.068
3. z=0.4075: E(0.4075)
   - (1 + z)=1.4075
   - 0.3*(1.4075)^3 ≈ 0.3*(2.808) ≈ 0.842
   - 0.7*(1.4075)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(1.4075) ≈ 0.344
      - 0.6924*0.344 ≈ 0.238
      - e^0.238 ≈ 1.268
      - 0.7 / 1.268 ≈ 0.552
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(0.842 + 0.552) ≈ sqrt(1.394) ≈ 1.181
4. z=0.61125: E(0.61125)
   - (1 + z)=1.61125
   - 0.3*(1.61125)^3 ≈ 0.3*(4.238) ≈ 1.271
   - 0.7*(1.61125)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(1.61125) ≈ 0.476
      - 0.6924*0.476 ≈ 0.329
      - e^0.329 ≈ 1.389
      - 0.7 / 1.389 ≈ 0.504
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(1.271 + 0.504) ≈ sqrt(1.775) ≈ 1.332
5. z=0.815: E(0.815)
   - (1 + z)=1.815
   - 0.3*(1.815)^3 ≈ 0.3*(5.983) ≈ 1.795
   - 0.7*(1.815)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(1.815) ≈ 0.593
      - 0.6924*0.593 ≈ 0.410
      - e^0.410 ≈ 1.506
      - 0.7 / 1.506 ≈ 0.466
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(1.795 + 0.466) ≈ sqrt(2.261) ≈ 1.504
6. z=1.01875: E(1.01875)
   - (1 + z)=2.01875
   - 0.3*(2.01875)^3 ≈ 0.3*(8.207) ≈ 2.462
   - 0.7*(2.01875)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(2.01875) ≈ 0.703
      - 0.6924*0.703 ≈ 0.487
      - e^0.487 ≈ 1.629
      - 0.7 / 1.629 ≈ 0.429
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(2.462 + 0.429) ≈ sqrt(2.891) ≈ 1.701
7. z=1.2225: E(1.2225)
   - (1 + z)=2.2225
   - 0.3*(2.2225)^3 ≈ 0.3*(10.96) ≈ 3.288
   - 0.7*(2.2225)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(2.2225) ≈ 0.798
      - 0.6924*0.798 ≈ 0.552
      - e^0.552 ≈ 1.741
      - 0.7 / 1.741 ≈ 0.402
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(3.288 + 0.402) ≈ sqrt(3.690) ≈ 1.921
8. z=1.42625: E(1.42625)
   - (1 + z)=2.42625
   - 0.3*(2.42625)^3 ≈ 0.3*(14.23) ≈ 4.269
   - 0.7*(2.42625)^(-0.6924)
      - ln(2.42625) ≈ 0.885
      - 0.6924*0.885 ≈ 0.612
      - e^0.612 ≈ 1.843
      - 0.7 / 1.843 ≈ 0.380
   - So, E ≈ sqrt(4.269 + 0.380) ≈ sqrt(4.649) ≈ 2.157
9. z=1.63: E=2.394 (from earlier)

Now, let's list all E(z) and 1/E(z):

z | E(z) | 1/E(z)
---|-----|-----
0 | 0.844 | 1.183
0.20375 | 1.068 | 0.939
0.4075 | 1.181 | 0.844
0.61125 | 1.332 | 0.751
0.815 | 1.504 | 0.666
1.01875 | 1.701 | 0.587
1.2225 | 1.921 | 0.522
1.42625 | 2.157 | 0.464
1.63 | 2.394 | 0.419

Now, applying Simpson's rule with n=8 intervals (which is even, so it works).

Simpson's rule formula:

∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx ≈ (Δx / 3) [f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + 2f(x4) + 4f(x5) + 2f(x6) + 4f(x7) + f(x8)]

Where Δx = 1.63 / 8 ≈ 0.20375

So, let's compute each term:

f(x0) = 1.183

f(x1) = 0.939, multiplied by 4: 4*0.939 = 3.756

f(x2) = 0.844, multiplied by 2: 1.688

f(x3) = 0.751, multiplied by 4: 3.004

f(x4) = 0.666, multiplied by 2: 1.332

f(x5) = 0.587, multiplied by 4: 2.348

f(x6) = 0.522, multiplied by 2: 1.044

f(x7) = 0.464, multiplied by 4: 1.856

f(x8) = 0.419

Now, sum all these up:

1.183 + 3.756 + 1.688 + 3.004 + 1.332 + 2.348 + 1.044 + 1.856 + 0.419

Compute step by step:

Start with 1.183

+3.756 = 4.939

+1.688 = 6.627

+3.004 = 9.631

+1.332 = 10.963

+2.348 = 13.311

+1.044 = 14.355

+1.856 = 16.211

+0.419 = 16.630

So, total sum ≈ 16.630

Multiply by Δx / 3:

Δx = 0.20375

Δx / 3 ≈ 0.06792

So, Simpson's integral ≈ 16.630 * 0.06792 ≈ 1.124

So, ∫_{0}^{1.63} 1/E(z) dz ≈ 1.124

But wait, this is in units of 1/(dimensionless), but since E(z) is unitless, the integral is unitless as well. So, to get D_C, we need to multiply by c.

So, D_C = c * ∫_{0}^{z} 1/E(z') dz' ≈ (3e5 km/s) * 1.124 ≈ 3.372e5 km/s * 1.124 ≈ 3.372e5 * 1.124 ≈ 3.372 * 1.124 ≈ 3.783e5 km/s * 1.124

Wait, no. Wait, D_C is in Mpc. Because c / H0 is in Mpc, and the integral is unitless.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

Earlier, I calculated c / H0 ≈ 4285.714 Mpc.

But in the Simpson's rule, the integral ∫_{0}^{z} 1/E(z') dz' is dimensionless (since E(z) is dimensionless, and z is dimensionless), so multiplying by c (in km/s) would give D_C in km/s * (unitless) * 1/(c? Wait, no.

Wait, no, the integral ∫_{0}^{z} 1/E(z') dz' is unitless because E(z') has units of 1/s (since it's sqrt( (1/s)^2 + (1/s)^2 ) in comoving units). Wait, no, actually E(z) is a comoving expansion rate, which is in units of s^-1. So, 1/E(z) is in seconds.

Wait, no, E(z) is sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{-3*...}), so E(z) is in units of expansion rate, which is s^-1. So, 1/E(z) is in seconds. Then, the integral ∫ 1/E(z) dz is in seconds * dimensionless (since z is dimensionless). So, the integral is in seconds.

Wait, so D_C = c * ∫ 1/E(z) dz.

But c is in km/s, ∫ 1/E(z) dz is in seconds.

So, km/s * seconds = km. But we need D_C in Mpc. So, 1 Mpc = 1e6 km.

So, D_C = (c * ∫ 1/E(z) dz) / 1e6 km/Mpc.

Let me compute it:

c = 3e5 km/s

∫ 1/E(z) dz ≈ 1.124

So, D_C ≈ (3e5 * 1.124) / 1e6 ≈ (3.372e5) / 1e6 ≈ 0.3372 Mpc

Wait, that can't be right because 0.337 Mpc is about 340 Mpc, but the proposed answer is 9 Gpc, which is 9000 Mpc. This is way off.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units.

Wait, no, comoving distance is in units of Mpc, not km. Because c is in km/s, and ∫1/E(z) dz is in seconds, but when multiplied by c (km/s), it gives km, which needs to be converted to Mpc.

Wait, let's re-express D_C:

D_C = c * ∫_{0}^{z} (1 / E(z)) dz

But E(z) is in s^-1, so 1/E(z) is in seconds. So, integrating 1/E(z) over z (dimensionless) gives seconds. Then, c (km/s) * seconds = km.

So, to get D_C in Mpc, we need to convert km to Mpc: 1 Mpc = 1e6 km.

Therefore, D_C = (c * ∫ 1/E(z) dz) / 1e6

So, plugging in:

c = 3e5 km/s

∫ 1/E(z) dz ≈ 1.124

So, D_C ≈ (3e5 * 1.124) / 1e6 ≈ (3.372e5) / 1e6 ≈ 0.3372 Mpc

Wait, that still doesn't make sense because 0.337 Mpc is way less than 9 Gpc.

Hold on, I think I messed up the units.

Wait, no, comoving distance is in Mpc, but according to our calculation, it's only 0.337 Mpc, which is about 340 Mpc. But in a universe with H0=70, 1 Gpc is about 3.26e3 Mpc. So, 9 Gpc is about 29,470 Mpc.

Wait, 0.337 Mpc is just over a third of a Mpc. That seems way too small for the comoving distance of a quasar that's redshift z≈1.63.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I applied Simpson's rule, I summed f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + f(x8). Then, multiplied by Δx / 3 ≈ 0.06792.

But f(x) here is 1/E(z). So, 1/E(z) is in units of 1/s, but when we integrate over z (dimensionless), the integral is in seconds. Then, multiplied by c (km/s) gives km, which is 0.3372 Mpc.

But that seems counterintuitive because a redshift of z=1.63 should correspond to a comoving distance much larger.

Wait, maybe I need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the E(z) calculation.

Wait, let me check E(z=0.20375):

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1 + z)^3 + 0.7*(1 + z)^(-3*(0.3/(1 + 0.3)))) = sqrt(0.3*(1.20375)^3 + 0.7*(1.20375)^(-0.6924))

Compute 1.20375^3 ≈ 1.737

0.3*1.737 ≈ 0.521

1.20375^0.6924: ln(1.20375) ≈ 0.180, 0.6924*0.180 ≈ 0.1245, e^0.1245 ≈ 1.
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about a quasar's comoving distance. Let me see if I can figure this out. The problem says that observations of a quasar show a peak in the near-infrared and optical spectrum around 790 nm. At shorter wavelengths than that, the flux drops significantly. They’re asking about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth, assuming a Lambda-CDM model universe with specific parameters. The answer is said to be 9 Gpc, but I need to understand why.

First, I need to recall what comoving distance means. From what I remember, comoving distance is like the distance a light ray would travel in a universe without expansion. It's a way to measure how far away an object is, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula I think is something like \( D = a_0 \times \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz'}{H(z')} \), where \( a_0 \) is the scale factor at the present time, and \( H(z') \) is the Hubble parameter at redshift \( z' \). But I might be mixing up the exact formula. 

The quasar's redshift is going to be important here. If there's a peak in the spectrum at 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that suggests that the quasar's light is being redshifted. In the rest frame of the quasar, if the peak was, say, around 790 nm, then the observed wavelength is longer if the quasar is moving away. Wait, no—actually, if the observed wavelength is longer, that means the quasar is at a higher redshift, because longer wavelengths imply redshift. But here, the peak is at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops. Hmm, maybe that's the rest wavelength?

Wait, hold on. If the quasar has a peak in its emitted spectrum, say, in the optical/near-infrared, but due to redshift, that peak shifts to a longer wavelength in the observed frame. So if the rest frame peak is at, say, 400 nm, a higher redshift would make it appear at 790 nm in the observed frame. But in the problem, it says that the peak is at 790 nm and at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops. That suggests that above 790 nm, the flux is higher. So perhaps the peak is at 790 nm in the rest frame? Or is that the observed frame?

Wait, I need to clarify this. The peak is at 790 nm in the observed spectrum. So if the quasar's rest frame has a peak at some shorter wavelength, but because of redshift, it's observed at 790 nm. So if the rest wavelength is \( \lambda_r \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda = \lambda_r \times (1 + z) \). Therefore, \( z = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_r} - 1 \). But we don't know \( \lambda_r \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is at rest wavelength 790 nm, so the observed wavelength would be \( 790 \times (1 + z) \). But in the problem, it's said that in observations, the peak is at 790 nm. So that could mean either that the rest peak is 790 nm, and observed is longer, or the rest peak is shorter, and observed is 790 nm.

Wait, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. So if the peak is at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths than that, the flux is lower. That suggests that the peak is redshifted to 790 nm, because if the rest frame peak was at a shorter wavelength, a higher redshift would shift it to a longer wavelength, where the flux is higher. Wait, no, actually, if something is observed at a longer wavelength, that's due to redshift. If the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that could mean that the object is at a certain redshift where the peak is at 790 nm.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar is emitting most of its flux at 790 nm in the rest frame, but because of redshift, it's observed at a longer wavelength, so the peak is shifted. But in the problem, it's stated that the peak is at 790 nm in the observed spectrum, which could mean that 790 nm is the observed peak. Therefore, the rest frame would have the peak at 790 / (1 + z). But without knowing the rest wavelength, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps 790 nm is the rest wavelength? If so, then the redshift z would be such that the observed wavelength is 790 nm. But no, that would imply a redshift, but the flux is dropping at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the peak in the spectrum, at 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths, the flux drops. So that suggests that the object is redshifted such that the peak is at 790 nm. So in the rest frame, the peak would be at a shorter wavelength. So if the rest frame peak is at, say, 500 nm, and z=1, then the observed peak would be at 1000 nm. But in this case, the observed peak is at 790 nm, so the redshift z would be (790 / λ_rest) - 1.

But we don't know λ_rest. Maybe I need to make another assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the Lyman break or something. Wait, quasars have emission lines, and if the peak is at 790 nm, which is around the red end of the optical into near-infrared.

Wait, maybe this is about the quasar's redshift. So if the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame, then assuming that in the rest frame, the peak is at a shorter wavelength, so that (1 + z) * λ_rest = 790.

But without knowing λ_rest, we can't find z. So perhaps the question is assuming that the observed peak corresponds to a certain rest wavelength?

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's observed peak is at 790 nm, which is in the optical/near-infrared. In the rest frame, that peak would be at a shorter wavelength, so the quasar's redshift is such that 790 nm is shifted from its rest frame. So, if we can estimate the quasar's redshift, we can compute the comoving distance.

Wait, but the problem is about the comoving distance, so perhaps I need to relate this to the redshift. But without knowing the quasar's redshift, how can we compute comoving distance? Maybe I need to assume that the quasar's redshift is such that the observed wavelength of its peak is 790 nm, but from the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths, which would imply that at higher redshifts, the flux is lower, perhaps due to the Lyman limit or something.

Wait, another thought: if the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that might indicate that we're looking beyond the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is about 90 nm, and beyond that, the flux from a quasar would drop because of intervening neutral gas. But here, the drop is at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. So if 790 nm is the observed peak, then the rest frame wavelength must be shorter than 790 / (1 + z). Wait, but if the drop is at shorter wavelengths, maybe the quasar's light is absorbed below a certain wavelength at a certain redshift.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

The question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The given answer is 9 Gpc. So perhaps I need to find the redshift corresponding to a comoving distance of 9 Gpc, and see if that relates to the observed wavelength peak.

In a flat Lambda-CDM universe with matter density 0.3 and dark energy density 0.7, the Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So, first, I can compute the comoving distance for a given redshift using the integral for comoving distance:

\( D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \times \int_{0}^{z} \frac{1}{(1 + z') H(z') / H_0} } dz' \)

But since H(z) = H_0 E(z), and E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m(1 + z)^3 + Omega_lambda(1 + z)^{-3w}) assuming de Sitter (w = -1), but in our case, with matter and dark energy, we might need to use a more accurate expression.

Alternatively, for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the integral can be expressed numerically or using approximation formulas. But I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe I can look it up or approximate it.

Wait, but maybe we can use an approximate formula for comoving distance. I remember that for low redshifts (z << 1), the comoving distance can be approximated as:

\( D_c \approx \frac{c}{H_0} \left( z + \frac{1}{2}(1 - q_0) z^2 \right) \)

where \( q_0 = \frac{d ln D_c}{d ln \eta} \) evaluated at z=0, but perhaps that's too vague.

Alternatively, since H_0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, but c is in Mpc/s, so let me compute c in terms of H_0. c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s, so H_0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H_0 = 3 x 10^5 / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. So that's about 4.29 Gpc. So for comoving distance, if D_c = c/H_0 * integral(...), then if the integral is about 2, D_c would be around 8.5 Gpc. If the integral is a bit more, say 2.1, then it's 9 Gpc.

So why would the integral be about 2.1?

I think for a universe dominated by matter and dark energy, the integral for comoving distance can be approximated. Let me try to recall.

For a flat universe with matter density Omega_m and dark energy density Omega_lambda (with Omega_m + Omega_lambda = 1), the integral for comoving distance is:

\( \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz'}{H_0 E(z')} \)

where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1 + z)^3 + Omega_lambda (1 + z)^{3(1 + w)}} \)

Since dark energy for lambda model has w = -1, so it becomes \( (1 + z)^{-3} \).

So, \( E(z) = \sqrt{0.3 (1 + z)^3 + 0.7 (1 + z)^{-3}} \)

So the integral becomes:

\( \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz'}{H_0 \sqrt{0.3 (1 + z')^3 + 0.7 (1 + z')^{-3}}} \)

This looks like an integral that might not have a simple analytical solution, so we need to compute it numerically or use an approximation.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a standard table or approximation for comoving distances in such a universe.

Wait, for z around 1, 2, etc., I can estimate the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's redshift can be found from the observed wavelength, assuming the peak is at rest frame wavelength 790 nm?

Wait, no, the observed wavelength is 790 nm, so the rest frame wavelength is shorter. So, if we assume that in the rest frame, the peak is at, say, 500 nm, then the redshift z = (790 / 500) - 1 = 0.58.

But without knowing the rest frame, how can we know z?

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the peak at 790 nm is the rest frame, so z is such that observed wavelength is 790 nm. But if the rest frame is 790 nm, then (1 + z) = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. But we don't know lambda_rest. Alternatively, perhaps 790 nm is the rest wavelength, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, meaning the quasar is at a redshift where the observed wavelength is longer, so to get the flux drop, perhaps the quasar is beyond the Lyman limit.

Wait, but 790 nm is still in the optical range, not UV. If the rest frame peak is in the UV, then the redshift could be such that the UV peak is observed in the optical. For example, if rest wavelength is 400 nm, then z = (790/400) - 1 ≈ 1.475.

But again, without knowing rest frame, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at z=1.475, but how does that tie into comoving distance?

Wait, maybe the peak is observed in near-infrared, so if 790 nm is in the near-infrared, maybe the rest frame is around 500 nm, so z ≈ 1.58.

Alternatively, I think I need to consider that the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths might be due to intergalactic medium absorption, like the IGM. The IGM has a high neutral Hydrogen density at certain redshifts, which can cause a Gunn-Peterson trough, cutting off the flux bluewards of a certain wavelength. The optical depth depends on the redshift.

The Gunn-Peterson wavelength is given by \( \lambda_GP = \frac{1}{(1 + z) \sqrt{\Omega_m(1 + z)^3 + \Omega_lambda}} \). For a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the equation becomes:

\( \lambda_GP = \frac{1}{(1 + z) \sqrt{0.3(1 + z)^3 + 0.7}} \)

So, if the observed flux drops at wavelengths shorter than some value, say, 400 nm, then the Gunn-Peterson wavelength would be around 400 nm, and thus we can solve for z.

But in our case, the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, so the Gunn-Peterson wavelength is less than 790 nm. So:

\( \frac{1}{(1 + z) \sqrt{0.3(1 + z)^3 + 0.7}} < 790 \)

Hmm, maybe this can give us an upper bound on z.

Wait, but 790 nm is in the optical, so if the Gunn-Peterson wavelength is less than that, then the quasar is at a redshift where the IGM has absorbed all photons blueward of that wavelength. So the observed flux drop is due to the IGM, not just the quasar's own emission.

But whether this is the case, I think quasars can have their spectra affected by the IGM at high redshifts, but for lower redshifts, say z < 6, the IGM might not be dense enough to cause a significant drop.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar's own spectrum is dropping at shorter wavelengths because of its intrinsic properties. But in that case, the redshift would not be the cause.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's own spectrum drops at shorter wavelengths due to the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is around 90 nm. If the rest frame of the quasar has a drop at 90 nm, then in the observed frame, that's 90*(1+z) nm. So if we see a drop at, say, 500 nm, then z = (500 / 90) - 1 ≈ 4.55.

But in the problem, the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, which is in the optical. So if the rest frame drop is at, say, 500 nm, the observed drop would be at 500*(1+z) nm. If the observed drop is at 500 nm, that implies a redshift of z = (500 / 500) - 1 = 0, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: if the rest frame drop is at 500 nm, then the observed drop would be at 500*(1 + z) nm. So if the observed drop is at 790 nm, then:

790 = 500*(1 + z)

So, 1 + z = 790 / 500 = 1.58

Thus, z ≈ 0.58.

Alternatively, if the rest frame drop is at 400 nm, the observed drop is at 400*(1 + z) = 790 nm, so 1 + z = 1.975, so z ≈ 0.975.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, it's hard to find z.

Wait, maybe the peak is at rest wavelength 500 nm, observed at 790 nm, so z ≈ 0.58. Then the comoving distance would be D_c = c/H0 * integral(0 to z) 1/E(z') dz'.

But if z is 0.58, then in a matter dominated universe, the integral is manageable, but with dark energy, it's a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at such a redshift that its light is shifted into the near-infrared, which is why we see the peak at 790 nm. So, if the rest peak is say, in the optical, like 400 nm, then the redshift is about (790 / 400) - 1 = 1.475. Then, compute comoving distance for z=1.475.

Alternatively, maybe the quasar is at a much higher redshift, like z=2, so that the observed wavelength is 790 nm. Then z=(790 / λ_rest) -1. But again, without knowing λ_rest, this is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the quasar is at a redshift where the observed wavelength of 790 nm is the rest wavelength of some feature, like the Mg II emission line. The Mg II line is around 279 nm in the rest frame, so if observed at 790 nm, then z=(790 / 279) -1 ≈ 2.83.

But that's just an assumption; I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about redshift but about the age of the universe. If the comoving distance is 9 Gpc, then the age of the universe at that redshift can be computed.

But with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, the age of the universe at a comoving distance D is approximately D / (c / H0) * (1 + z), but I think that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between comoving distance and redshift. In a flat universe, the comoving distance is related to the integral of 1/E(z'). So, for z=1, the integral is roughly around 2. So, if the integral is about 2, then D_c = (c/H0)*2.

Since c/H0 ≈ 4285 Mpc, so 4285 * 2 ≈ 8.57 Gpc. So if the integral is about 2.1, 4285 * 2.1 ≈ 9 Gpc.

So, why would the integral be around 2.1? For a universe with matter and dark energy, the integral can be computed numerically. Let me try to recall or approximate it.

The integral for comoving distance is:

\( D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1 + z')^3 + \Omega_lambda(1 + z')^{-3}}} \)

Plugging in the values, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

So, let's evaluate this integral at certain redshifts.

For example, at z=0, integral is 0.

At z=1:

Integral from 0 to1 of 1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7(1+z')^{-3}) dz'

Let me compute it numerically.

Let's make substitution t = 1 + z'

Then, when z'=0, t=1; z'=1, t=2.

So, integral becomes from t=1 to t=2 of [dt / sqrt(0.3 t^3 + 0.7 t^{-3})]

This integral can be evaluated numerically.

Let me try to approximate it.

Compute the integrand at different t:

At t=1:

sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) = 1. So integrand is 1.

At t=2:

sqrt(0.3*8 + 0.7*(1/8)) = sqrt(2.4 + 0.0875) = sqrt(2.4875) ≈ 1.577

So the function is decreasing from 1 to about 0.634 (1/1.577). So it's a decreasing function.

We can approximate the integral using trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

Let me use Simpson's rule for better accuracy. Let me take three intervals: t=1, t=1.5, t=2.

Compute f(t) at t=1: f=1

t=1.5:

sqrt(0.3*(3.375) + 0.7/(3.375)) = sqrt(1.0125 + 0.2069) ≈ sqrt(1.2194) ≈ 1.104

t=2: f=1.577

So, Simpson's rule for three points:

Integral ≈ (delta_t / 3) [f(t1) + 4f(t2) + f(t3)]

delta_t = 0.5

So:

≈ (0.5 / 3) [1 + 4*1.104 + 1.577] ≈ (0.1667)[1 + 4.416 + 1.577] ≈ 0.1667*(7.0) ≈ 1.1667

But this is a rough approximation. The actual integral from 1 to 2 is larger than that, because the function is above the trapezoid.

Alternatively, let's compute it with more points.

Alternatively, integrate numerically:

Compute f(t) at several points:

t=1: 1

t=1.2: sqrt(0.3*(1.728) + 0.7/(1.728)) = sqrt(0.5184 + 0.40625) ≈ sqrt(0.9247) ≈ 0.9618

t=1.4: sqrt(0.3*(2.744) + 0.7/(2.744)) ≈ sqrt(0.8232 + 0.255) ≈ sqrt(1.078) ≈ 1.038

t=1.6: sqrt(0.3*(4.096) + 0.7/(4.096)) ≈ sqrt(1.2288 + 0.1719) ≈ sqrt(1.4007) ≈ 1.183

t=1.8: sqrt(0.3*(5.832) + 0.7/(5.832)) ≈ sqrt(1.7496 + 0.1202) ≈ sqrt(1.8698) ≈ 1.368

t=2: sqrt≈1.577 as before.

So, let's use Simpson's rule with more points.

Using t=1,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2.

The number of intervals is 5, so even number of data points? Wait, Simpson's rule requires even number of intervals, so for 5 points, 4 intervals, which is even.

Compute f(t) at t=1:1, t=1.2:0.9618, t=1.4:1.038, t=1.6:1.183, t=1.8:1.368, t=2:1.577.

Now, apply Simpson's rule:

Integral ≈ (delta_t / 3) [f1 + 4f2 + 2f3 + 4f4 + f5]

Where delta_t = 0.2 each time.

Wait, no, delta_t is the step between t's. From 1 to 1.2 is 0.2, but the step between 1.8 and 2 is also 0.2, so delta_t=0.2.

Wait, no, each step is 0.2, but from t=1 to t=2, it's five points with four intervals, each 0.2. So Simpson's rule for four intervals (five points):

Integral ≈ (0.2 / 3) [f1 + 4f2 + 2f3 + 4f4 + f5]

So:

≈ (0.0666667) [1 + 4*0.9618 + 2*1.038 + 4*1.183 + 1.368 + 1.577]

Compute inside the brackets:

1 + 4*0.9618 = 1 + 3.8472 = 4.8472

+ 2*1.038 = 4.8472 + 2.076 = 6.9232

+ 4*1.183 = 6.9232 + 4.732 = 11.6552

+ 1.368 = 11.6552 + 1.368 = 13.0232

+ 1.577 = 13.0232 + 1.577 ≈ 14.6

So, integral ≈ 0.0666667 * 14.6 ≈ 0.9717

Wait, but this is the integral from t=1 to t=2. Wait, no, t went from 1 to 2 in steps of 0.2, but Simpson's rule gives the integral over the interval with the given function.

Wait, actually, Simpson's rule for the integral from a to b is (delta_t / 3) [f(a) + 4f(a + delta_t) + 2f(a + 2 delta_t) + ... + 4f(b - delta_t) + f(b)]

So, in our case, integrating from t=1 to t=2, with five points (t=1,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2), which is four intervals of 0.2 each.

So:

Integral ≈ (0.2 / 3) [f(1) + 4f(1.2) + 2f(1.4) + 4f(1.6) + 2f(1.8) + f(2)]

Wait, no, wait, Simpson's rule is weighted as 1,4,2,4,2,1 for five points (four intervals). So:

Integral ≈ (0.2 / 3) [f(1) + 4f(1.2) + 2f(1.4) + 4f(1.6) + 2f(1.8) + f(2)]

So, plugging in the numbers:

f(1)=1, f(1.2)=0.9618, f(1.4)=1.038, f(1.6)=1.183, f(1.8)=1.368, f(2)=1.577.

So:

≈ (0.0666667) [1 + 4*0.9618 + 2*1.038 + 4*1.183 + 2*1.368 + 1.577]

Compute step by step:

1 + 4*0.9618 = 1 + 3.8472 = 4.8472

+ 2*1.038 = 4.8472 + 2.076 = 6.9232

+ 4*1.183 = 6.9232 + 4.732 = 11.6552

+ 2*1.368 = 11.6552 + 2.736 = 14.3912

+ 1.577 = 14.3912 + 1.577 ≈ 15.9682

Multiply by 0.0666667:

≈ 15.9682 * 0.0666667 ≈ 1.0633

So, the integral from t=1 to t=2 is approximately 1.0633.

But wait, that can’t be right, because when I did Simpson's rule for three points earlier, I got 1.1667, but with more points, it's 1.0633. Hmm, seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe my function evaluations are off.

Wait, let me recompute f(t) at t=1.2:

t=1.2:

sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 + 0.7/(1.2)^3 )

1.2^3=1.728

0.3*1.728=0.5184

1.2^-3=1/1.728≈0.5787

0.7*0.5787≈0.406

So sqrt(0.5184 + 0.406)=sqrt(0.9244)=0.9618, correct.

t=1.4:

1.4^3=2.744

0.3*2.744=0.8232

1.4^-3≈1/(2.744)≈0.3646

0.7*0.3646≈0.255

sqrt(0.8232 + 0.255)=sqrt(1.078)=≈1.038, correct.

t=1.6:

1.6^3=4.096

0.3*4.096=1.2288

1.6^-3=1/4.096≈0.2441

0.7*0.2441≈0.171

sqrt(1.2288 + 0.171)=sqrt(1.40)≈1.183, correct.

t=1.8:

1.8^3=5.832

0.3*5.832=1.7496

1.8^-3≈1/(5.832)≈0.1715

0.7*0.1715≈0.120

sqrt(1.7496 + 0.120)=sqrt(1.8696)≈1.368, correct.

t=2:

As before, sqrt(2.4 + 0.0875)=sqrt(2.4875)=≈1.577, correct.

So, f(t) at these points are correct.

Then the integral from t=1 to t=2 is approximately 1.0633.

Wait, that seems low. Because in a matter dominated universe (Omega_m=1, Omega_lambda=0), the integral from 0 to z is roughly:

For z=1: integral ≈ 2.406

For z=2: integral ≈ 3.627

But in our case, with dark energy, the integral is lower because dark energy causes the expansion to accelerate, meaning that matter doesn't dominate as much, so the comoving distance for a given redshift is less than in a matter-only universe.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, dark energy makes the universe expand faster, so for a given redshift, comoving distance is larger? Wait, no. For a given redshift, comoving distance is actually larger in a matter-dominated universe because the expansion is slower.

Wait, no, wait: in a universe with dark energy, for higher redshifts, the expansion is faster, so the comoving distance, which is kind of the "distance" at the time of emission, is larger? Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a standard comoving distance table.

Alternatively, I can use an approximate formula. For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

\( D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \times \frac{1}{(1 + z)^{3/2} + \sqrt{\Omega_m}} } \)

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, another approach is to relate comoving distance to the age of the universe. The age of the universe at redshift z is given by:

\( t = \frac{1}{H_0} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \)

So, for the comoving distance, \( D_c = c \times t \).

So, the integral for D_c is the same as the integral for age, scaled by c.

So, in any case, without knowing the exact integral, or without a calculator, it's hard to compute.

But perhaps, if the quasar is at a redshift z=1.475, which would correspond to the peak at 790 nm if the rest peak is at 400 nm, then the comoving distance can be found.

But let me think differently.

The given answer is 9 Gpc, which is 9,000 Mpc.

Given that c/H0 ≈ 4285 Mpc, so 4285 * 2.1 ≈ 9,000 Mpc.

So, perhaps the integral for comoving distance is about 2.1.

So, in order to get an integral of 2.1, what redshift would that correspond to?

If I can recall, for a matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1), the integral from 0 to z is roughly (2/(3(1 + z)^{3/2})).

Wait, actually, for matter dominated, the comoving distance is:

\( D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \times \frac{2}{3(1 + z)^{3/2}} \)

So, for z=1, D_c = (c/H0)*(2/(3*2^{3/2})) ≈ (4285)*(2/(3*2.828)) ≈ 4285*(2/8.485)≈4285*0.2357≈1012 Mpc.

But in our case, it's a dark energy dominated universe, so the integral is larger than that, meaning the comoving distance is larger.

Wait, actually, wait, in a dark energy dominated universe, the expansion is accelerating, so the comoving distance is larger for the same redshift compared to matter dominated.

So, for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance is higher.

Wait, but to get 9 Gpc, the integral must be about 2.1, as 4285 * 2.1 ≈ 9,000.

So, for z=1.5:

Let me compute the integral numerically. Let's use t=1+z.

So, compute the integral of 1/sqrt(0.3 t^3 + 0.7 t^{-3}) from t=1 to t=2.5.

Again, using Simpson's rule for several intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula.

Wait, I found a resource that says:

For a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

\( D_c(z) \approx \frac{4285}{1.4} \times \frac{1}{(1 + z)^{1.4} + 0.3} \)

Wait, I'm not sure about that formula, but let me test it.

For z=0.5:

D_c ≈ 4285 / 1.4 / (1.5^{1.4} +0.3)

1.5^{1.4} ≈ e^{1.4 ln1.5} ≈ e^{1.4*0.4055} ≈ e^{0.5678}≈1.763

So denominator≈1.763 +0.3≈2.063

So D_c≈4285 /1.4 /2.063≈4285 / (1.4*2.063)≈4285 /2.888≈1485 Mpc.

But for z=0.5, in a matter dominated universe, D_c≈ 4285*(2/(3*(1.5)^{3/2}))≈4285*(2/(3*1.837))≈4285*(2/5.51)≈4285*0.362≈1555 Mpc. But in dark energy, I expect D_c to be lower than that, but our approximate formula gave 1485 Mpc, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is not correct.

Wait, instead, perhaps just accept that for a redshift of around z=1.475, which would correspond to a comoving distance of about 9 Gpc, the integral is about 2.1.

Alternatively, perhaps in the given question, the quasar's redshift is such that its light is observed at 790 nm, but the rest frame peak is at a shorter wavelength, so z≈ (790 / λ_rest
