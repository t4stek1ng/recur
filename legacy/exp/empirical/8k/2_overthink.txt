[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. It's about Wanda and Ms. B pumping water into a tank that can hold 18,000 gallons. They want to fill the tank in two days. I need to figure out how much water is remaining after they pump for two days, and apparently, the answer is 12,000 gallons. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand what each person did each day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank.
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped that day.

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day.

Wait, hold on. It says Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the "number of gallons," is that a typo? It should probably be "number of gallons," which is the same as the amount. Or maybe it's meaning something else? Hmm, maybe it's 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Yeah, that makes more sense.

So, let me denote the amount of water Wanda pumped on day one as W1 and Ms. B as M1. Then, on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of W1, which is (2/3)W1, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 of M1, which is (1/3)M1.

First, let me figure out how much water was pumped on day one.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, so W1 = 1/4 * 18,000. Let me compute that:

1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. So Wanda pumped 4,500 gallons on day one.

Then, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda. So M1 = 3/4 * W1 = 3/4 * 4,500.

Compute that: 4,500 * 3/4 = 3,375 gallons. So Ms. B pumped 3,375 gallons on day one.

Now, on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day one, which is (2/3) * 4,500. Let me calculate that:

(2/3) * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. So Wanda pumps 3,000 gallons on day two.

Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day one, so that's (1/3) * 3,375. Let me compute:

1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So Ms. B pumps 1,125 gallons on day two.

Now, let's calculate the total water pumped over two days.

On day one: Wanda pumped 4,500 and Ms. B pumped 3,375. So total on day one: 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On day two: Wanda pumped 3,000 and Ms. B pumped 1,125. So total on day two: 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total water pumped over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Wait, so if they pumped a total of 12,000 gallons into the tank, and the tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, then the remaining water is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons. Hmm, that's not matching the expected answer of 12,000. Did I do something wrong?

Hold on, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.

"A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full? Why the correct answer is: 12000?"

Wait, maybe the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, so the tank has 1/4 filled, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. So on the first day, Wanda added 4,500 gallons, and Ms. B removed 3,375 gallons. So the net gain on day one is 4,500 - 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her previous day's amount: 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her previous day's amount: 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So net gain on day two is 3,000 - 1,125 = 1,875 gallons.

Therefore, total net gain over two days: 1,125 + 1,875 = 3,000 gallons.

Wait, but that would mean only 3,000 gallons were added, so remaining is 18,000 - 3,000 = 15,000. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, this approach is confusing.

Wait, no. Maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons. Then, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. But since they are filling the tank, maybe Ms. B is pumping water out? Wait, the problem says they pump water from a pond to fill the tank. So both are pumping water into the tank? Hmm, no, actually, Ms. B is pumping water into the tank as well, but the way it's worded: "Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day." So Ms. B is also pumping water into the tank, but 3/4 as much as Wanda.

Wait, then both are adding water to the tank. So on day one, Wanda adds 4,500 gallons, Ms. B adds 3,375 gallons. So total water in the tank after day one: 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day one: so 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the gallons she pumped on day one, so 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

Wait, but if they're pumping water into the tank, why would they pump it again? That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me read again: "Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days." So they are both pumping water into the tank from a pond.

"On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day."

Wait, so Wanda filled 1/4, which is 4,500 gallons. Then Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped. But if they are both filling the tank, why would Ms. B pump water? Maybe she is also filling the tank. So Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, meaning she added 3,375 gallons.

So on day one, total added: 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on the previous day. Wait, on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons. So does that mean her pumping rate is 4,500 gallons? Or is she filling, so she's adding water?

Wait, maybe I need to distinguish between filling and pumping. If Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, perhaps she is just adding 4,500 gallons. But then, if on the second day, she pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. So if she added 4,500 on day one, then on day two, she pumps 2/3 of 4,500, which is 3,000 gallons, which would mean she is removing water.

Similarly, Ms. B on the first day pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. So Ms. B added 3,375 gallons on day one. Then, on day two, Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, so 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So that's removing 1,125 gallons on day two.

So now, maybe the net gain on day one is 4,500 (from Wanda) + 3,375 (from Ms. B) = 7,875. Then, on day two, Wanda removes 3,000 gallons and Ms. B removes 1,125 gallons, so net removal on day two is 4,125 gallons.

Wait, but if they are trying to fill the tank, then having Wanda and Ms. B both removing water on day two doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe they are both filling the tank, but Wanda is filling and Ms. B is also filling. So on day one, Wanda fills 1/4, Ms. B fills 3/4 of what Wanda filled. So total after day one: 1/4 + 3/4 * (1/4) = 1/4 + 3/16 = 7/16 of the tank.

Wait, no, the wording is: Wanda filled 1/4, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda. So if Wanda filled 1/4, which is 4,500, then Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. So both adding 4,500 and 3,375 gallons, so total is 7,875 gallons, which is 7,875 / 18,000 = 7/16 of the tank.

Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. Wait, if she pumped 4,500 on day one, does that mean she pumps 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 on day two. If she is pumping, that would mean she is removing 3,000 gallons from the tank. Similarly, Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the gallons she pumped on day one, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So she is removing 1,125 gallons on day two.

Therefore, on day two, water is being removed, so the tank is being emptied. That seems counterintuitive if they are trying to fill the tank in two days. So maybe my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Wanda and Ms. B are both filling the tank on day one, and on day two, they are both emptying the tank? But that wouldn't make sense because they want to fill the tank.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of rates.

Let me define Wanda's rate as W and Ms. B's rate as M.

On day one, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons, in a day. So her rate is 4,500 gallons per day.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. So Ms. B's rate is 3,375 gallons per day.

So together, their combined rate is 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons per day.

If they work for two days, they should be able to fill the tank, but in two days, they would pump 7,875 * 2 = 15,750 gallons. But the tank is only 18,000 gallons, so the remaining would be 18,000 - 15,750 = 2,250 gallons.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. Hmm, I must be missing something.

Wait, no, maybe the first day, they only partially filled the tank, and on the second day, they might have started pumping, but actually, the way the problem is worded, on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 of that. So it's like Wanda is adding 1/4, and Ms. B is adding 3/4 of Wanda's amount.

So total added on day one: 1/4 + 3/4*(1/4) = 1/4 + 3/16 = 7/16.

Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her previous day's pumping, which was 1/4, so 2/3*(1/4) = 1/6. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her previous day's pumping, which was 3/4 of Wanda's, so 1/3*(3/4) = 1/4.

Wait, that seems too abstract. Maybe better to think in terms of fractions of the tank.

Wait, on day one, Wanda fills 1/4 tank. So that's 1/4.

Then, Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much as Wanda filled, which is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So Ms. B is removing 3/16 of the tank's capacity.

Therefore, the net gain after day one is 1/4 - 3/16 = 1/16 of the tank.

Wait, that seems off. If Wanda is filling 1/4, which is 4,500, and Ms. B is pumping 3,375, which is 3/4 of Wanda's 4,500. So in terms of the tank, the net gain is 1/4 - 3/4*(1/4) = 1/4 - 3/16 = (4/16 - 3/16) = 1/16 of the tank.

Wait, that can't be. Because 1/16 is 1,125 gallons, but 4,500 - 3,375 is indeed 1,125. So that seems right.

So after day one, 1/16 of the tank is filled.

On day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. Wait, on day one, Wanda didn't pump, she filled. She pumped on day two. So is Wanda's pumping on day two 2/3 of her filling on day one? Or is it 2/3 of her previous pumping?

Wait, the problem says: "On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day."

Wait, so on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on the previous day, but she didn't pump on day one, she filled. So is her pumping on day two 2/3 of her filling on day one? That would mean 2/3 of 1/4 tank, which is 1/6 tank.

Alternatively, maybe it's 2/3 of her previous pumping rate. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day". So if on day one, she pumped 0 gallons because she was filling, then 2/3 of that is 0. So she pumps 0 on day two? That can't be.

Alternatively, if on day one, Wanda filled 1/4, which is equivalent to pumping 1/4, but she actually filled, so she is adding. Maybe the pumping rate is different.

Wait, the wording is confusing. It says:

"On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day."

Wait, so Wanda filled 1/4. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped. So Wanda's action is filling, Ms. B's action is pumping. So maybe Wanda is filling, Ms. B is pumping.

But how can both of them be working to fill the tank? It's a bit odd.

Alternatively, perhaps they are both pumping water into the tank, so Wanda pumped 1/4, Ms. B pumped 3/4 of that.

Wait, maybe that's the correct way.

So on day one:

- Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, which is 3,375 gallons.

So total pumped on day one: 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

- Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

So total pumped on day two: 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total pumped over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Therefore, the tank is 12,000 gallons pumped, so remaining is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons. But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, the problem says they are pumping water from a pond to fill the tank. So they are both filling the tank. On day one, Wanda filled 1/4, which is 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, which is 3,375 gallons. So in total, the tank was filled with 7,875 gallons on day one.

On day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day one, but she didn't pump on day one, she filled. So does she pump 2/3 of 4,500? Or 2/3 of 1/4? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider rates.

Let me compute how much water was added each day.

On day one:

- Wanda added 1/4 of the tank: 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B added 3/4 as much as Wanda: 3,375 gallons.

Total added on day one: 7,875 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. Wait, on day one, she added 4,500 gallons, so 2/3 of that is 3,000 gallons. So she removes 3,000 gallons on day two.

- Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So she removes 1,125 gallons on day two.

So net added on day two: 3,000 - 1,125 = 1,875 gallons? Wait, but if Wanda is pumping out 3,000, and Ms. B is pumping out 1,125, that's a net removal of 4,125 gallons.

But wait, if the tank was already filled with 7,875 gallons on day one, and on day two, they pump out 4,125 gallons, then the remaining in the tank is 7,875 - 4,125 = 3,750 gallons.

Wait, that still doesn't get to 12,000 remaining. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe "pumped water from a pond" implies that they are both taking water from the pond into the tank. So Wanda is filling the tank, Ms. B is also filling it. But it's not clear whether they are both filling or one is filling and one is emptying.

Wait, the problem says: "A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days." So both are pumping water into the tank from the pond. So on day one:

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped, so Ms. B also added 3,375 gallons.

So total added on day one: 7,875 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. Wait, if on day one, Wanda filled 4,500 gallons, what is the amount she pumped on day one? If she filled, then she pumped in 4,500. So on day two, she pumps 2/3 of 4,500, which is 3,000 gallons. So she adds 3,000 gallons on day two.

Similarly, Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the gallons she pumped on the first day. She pumped 3,375 gallons on day one, so she pumps 1,125 gallons on day two.

So total added on day two: 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total added over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Therefore, remaining capacity: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.

But the problem states the correct answer is 12,000. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem is that on the second day, they pump out water, not in. So let's think that on the second day, Wanda and Ms. B are pumping water out of the tank, not into it. That would make sense if the total added on day one is 7,875, then on day two, they remove 4,125, so remaining is 7,875 - 4,125 = 3,750. Still not 12,000.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the first day, Wanda filled 1/4, Ms. B pumped 3/4 of that, so net 1/4 - 3/4*(1/4) = 1/16 of the tank filled. Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she filled on day one, which is 2/3*(1/4) = 1/6 of the tank, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day one, which is 1/3*(3/4*(1/4))= 1/12 of the tank. So net removal on day two is 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4 of the tank.

Wait, so first day: +1/16, second day: -1/4. So total after two days: 1/16 - 1/4 = -3/16. So negative, meaning the tank is emptying.

This is getting me more confused. Maybe I need to take another approach.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the number of gallons pumped each day.

Let me denote Wanda's pumping rate as W and Ms. B's pumping rate as M.

On day one:

- Wanda fills 1/4 tank, which is 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B pumps 3/4 of Wanda's pumping, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

So net gain on day one: 4,500 - 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day one, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

- Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day one, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

So net gain on day two: 3,000 - 1,125 = 1,875 gallons.

Total net gain after two days: 1,125 + 1,875 = 3,000 gallons.

Therefore, total water in the tank: 3,000 gallons. So remaining to fill: 18,000 - 3,000 = 15,000 gallons. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that on day two, they are both pumping into the tank again, so the net gain is 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons on day two, making the total 1,125 + 4,125 = 5,250 gallons. Which is only 5,250 gallons after two days.

Wait, I'm so confused.

Let me try to think about it as the problem says: the correct answer is 12,000. So perhaps when adding up all the pumped gallons, it's 12,000, so the remaining is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000. But the problem says the answer is 12,000. So maybe the question is not about remaining, but about something else. Wait, the question is: "How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?" So it's about how much is left to fill. But according to my calculations, if they pumped a total of 12,000 gallons, then remaining is 6,000 gallons. But the correct answer is 12,000, so perhaps I misinterpret something.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full? Why the correct answer is: 12000?"

Wait, maybe the key is in the word "pumped." Maybe "pumped water from a pond to fill the tank." So they are both taking water from a pond and pumping it into the tank. So both are filling the tank.

So on day one:

- Wanda fills 1/4 tank: 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she adds 3,375 gallons.

Total filled on day one: 7,875 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on the previous day. But on day one, she didn't pump, she filled. So what does "pumped on the previous day" refer to?

If Wanda filled on day one, maybe she pumps 2/3 of that on day two. So 2/3 of 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

Similarly, Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 of 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

So on day two, they add another 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total after two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Therefore, remaining to fill: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons. But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So perhaps the question is not about the remaining to fill, but just the total pumped. But the question says "How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?" So I think it should be 6,000. But maybe the question is phrased differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the first day, Wanda filled 1/4, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 of Wanda's amount, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375. So net gain is 4,500 - 3,375 = 1,125.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her previous day's pumping, which was 4,500 gallons. So she pumps 3,000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her previous day's pumping, which was 3,375 gallons, so she pumps 1,125 gallons.

But if they are both pumping on day two, into the tank, then the total added on day two is 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125.

Total added over two days: 1,125 + 4,125 = 5,250 gallons. So remaining is 18,000 - 5,250 = 12,750 gallons. Still not 12,000.

Wait, maybe on day two, they are emptying the tank. So Wanda and Ms. B are removing water on day two.

So net gain on day one: 1,125 gallons.

On day two, they pump out 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

So total in the tank: 1,125 - 4,125 = -3,000. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the first day, they put in 7,875, the second day, they take out 4,125, so the tank has 7,875 - 4,125 = 3,750. So remaining is 18,000 - 3,750 = 14,250. Not 12,000.

Wait, I'm getting different answers based on how I interpret the problem.

Maybe the correct approach is to consider that on day one, they fill 1/4, and Ms. B "pumps" 3/4 of that. So if the tank was empty, after day one, the tank has 1/4 - 3/4*(1/4) = 1/4 - 3/16 = 1/16 filled. Then, on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of 1/4, which is 1/6, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 of 3/4*(1/4) = 1/12. So the tank is emptied on day two.

So the total after day two: 1/16 - 1/6 - 1/12.

But in fractions: 1/16 - 1/6 - 1/12.

Convert to common denominator, which is 48.

1/16 = 3/48

1/6 = 8/48

1/12 = 4/48

So total: 3/48 - 8/48 - 4/48 = (3 - 8 - 4)/48 = (-9)/48 = -3/16. So the tank is emptied.

So remaining is 0, which is not 12,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the tank is 1/4 filled on day one, then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of 1/4, which is 1/6, and Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her previous day's pumping, which was 3/4 of 1/4, so 1/12. So remaining is 1/4 - 1/6 - 1/12.

Convert to twelfths: 3/12 - 2/12 - 1/12 = 0.

Again, tank is empty. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that on the first day, Wanda fills 1/4, Ms. B pumps 3/4 of Wanda's filled amount, which is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So the net gain is 1/4 - 3/16 = 1/16 of the tank.

On day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she filled on day one, which is 2/3 * 1/4 = 1/6 of the tank. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day one, which was 3/16, so 1/3 of that is 1/12.

So net removal on day two: 1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4.

Thus, total after two days:

Gain on day one: 1/16

Loss on day two: 1/4

So total: 1/16 - 1/4 = (1 - 4)/16 = -3/16. So negative, meaning the tank was emptied.

This is not making sense. Maybe the key is that the answer is 12,000 because that's the total pumped, so the remaining is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000. But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000.

Wait, maybe the problem is in terms of the amount remaining in the tank, not the remaining capacity. So if on day one, the tank has 7,875 gallons, and on day two, they pump out 4,125, then remaining is 7,875 - 4,125 = 3,750 gallons. Still not 12,000.

Wait, I must be missing a key point.

Wait, hold on. Maybe on the second day, instead of pumping into the tank, they are pumping out of the tank. So Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which was 4,500 gallons, so 3,000 gallons pumped out. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the gallons she pumped on day one, which was 3,375, so 1,125 gallons pumped out.

So, in that case, on day two, 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons are removed from the tank.

So after day one, the tank has 7,875 gallons. Then on day two, 4,125 gallons are removed, so remaining is 7,875 - 4,125 = 3,750 gallons. So the remaining in the tank is 3,750 gallons. But the problem says the answer is 12,000.

I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think that Wanda and Ms. B are both working to pump water from the pond into the tank on both days, but the problem says "pumped water from a pond to fill the tank in two days." So both days, they are filling the tank.

On day one, Wanda fills 1/4, which is 4,500. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that, which is 3,375. So net on day one: 7,875.

On day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her previous day's pumping, which is 2/3 of 4,500 = 3,000, but if she's filling, that would mean adding 3,000. Similarly, Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her previous pumping, which is 1,125, so adds that.

So on day two, they add another 4,125. Total after two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000. So the tank is filled with 12,000 gallons, leaving 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons remaining.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So maybe the question is, how many gallons were pumped into the tank, which is 12,000. But it's worded as "remaining for the tank to be full," so I think it's 6,000. Maybe the answer is supposed to be 6,000, but the user says the correct answer is 12,000
