[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answers are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me start by understanding the concepts involved here.

First, the question is about isomerism, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. There are two parts: part A asks which compound does not show tautomerism, and part B asks which of two compounds shows optical isomerism.

Let me start with part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one does not show tautomerism.

I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen atoms along with the movement of double bonds, leading to different structural isomers. Tautomerism is common in compounds with conjugated systems that allow for such shifts. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Since the benzene ring is a conjugated system, the double bonds can shift, which might lead to different tautomers. However, benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone, so it can exist in two forms: 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,2-benzoquinone, each being a tautomer of the other. Therefore, benzoquinone does show tautomerism.

Now, looking at cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This is a cyclic compound with three ketone groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. Since the ring is fully conjugated with three double bonds (or maybe not), but in reality, it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each carbonyl group is a double bond, which in a six-membered ring can lead to keto-enol tautomerism. However, in a fully substituted ring like this, does tautomerism occur?

Wait, in a cyclic system, especially with more than one keto group, tautomerism might not be as straightforward. Let me think: in a diketone, you can have enol form, but in a triketone, can you shift all three? Or does it get too constrained?

Or maybe in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually a cyclic structure where the ketone groups are positioned such that the double bonds are conjugated. But in such a case, can the double bonds shift? Let me imagine the structure. It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. So, each carbonyl is between two CH2 groups? No, actually, each carbonyl is at the position 1, 3, and 5, which are every other carbon. So, the ring would alternate between carbonyl and CH2 groups.

Wait, actually, if it's 1,3,5-tricyclohexanetrione, the structure would have three carbonyl groups opposite each other on the ring. In such a structure, each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. So the double bonds are in conjugated positions, but they are each isolated by single bonds. So, the double bonds can't shift past each other because they are not adjacent. Therefore, there is no possibility for tautomerism because the hydrogen can't shift from one carbonyl to another, as there's a single bond in between. So, in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't exhibit tautomerism because the necessary conjugated system isn't present to allow for the hydrogen transfer. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the correct answer for part A.

Moving on to part B: which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

First, let's recall that optical isomerism, or stereoisomerism, arises when the molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, let's check each compound.

Starting with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is: the central carbon (C2) has a hydroxyl group, a methyl ester group (OCH3), and two other substituents. Let me draw the structure: HOCH2-C(OOCH3)-CH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- A carboxylic ester group (OCH3)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO^- for the acid, so methyl ester would be CH3COOCH3. But the question is about 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-; 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that would be structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me confirm: for propionic acid, the carboxylic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, meaning that the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester.

But let me count the carbons. Propanoate has three carbons, so 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

But wait, that would make the central carbon (second carbon) bonded to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (but actually, the CH2 is attached to the COOCH3)
Wait, no. Let me better represent the structure. The formula of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO^-; if it's 2-hydroxy, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

1. OH group,
2. CH2COOCH3,
3. And two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

The carboxylic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, and when esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

- The first carbon: CH2(OH)
- The second carbon: CH2
- The third carbon: COOCH3

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the methyl ester),
- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- And another CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the structure as:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- A hydroxyl group (OH),
- A CH2 group connected to COOCH3,
- A CH2 group connected to another CH2 (but wait, no, it's a propanoate, so three carbons total).

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH2) has two CH2 groups attached, but wait, that would mean the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH2CH2(OH),
Wait, no. Maybe I need to count the substituents on the central carbon.

In 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon with the hydroxyl is the second carbon. So, the structure is:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 2: CH2
- Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but if the hydroxyl is on Carbon 2, then the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

Wait, that might make more sense. So, the molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- And another CH2 group? Wait, no.

Wait, no, in this structure, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- And another CH3? Wait, no, let me count.

Wait, I think I messed up the structure. Let me clarify.

Propanoate: the carboxylic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH2, attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH),
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- And two H atoms? Wait, no. Wait, if it's CH2-OH-CH2-COOCH3, then Carbon 2 is CH2 with two CH2 groups? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the full structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So, the structure is:

- The carboxylic acid part: CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Therefore, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH2, attached to:

- One CH2OH group (which is actually Carbon 1: CH2(OH)),
- One COOCH3 group (which is Carbon 3: COOCH3),
- Two H atoms.

Wait, so the central carbon (C2) is CH2 with two Hs. That can't be a chiral center because it's only attached to two Hs and two other groups. So, the central carbon (C2) has two Hs, one CH2OH, and one COOCH3. Therefore, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe I'm misidentifying the central carbon. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3.

Wait, that would be if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, if the central carbon is attached to a hydroxyl, a COOCH3, and two methyl groups, then it would be a chiral center. Let me verify.

If the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3,

then the central carbon (C2) would have four different groups: -CH3, -OH, -COOCH3, and another -CH3.

Wait, but wait, that would make it two CH3 groups, which are same. So, actually, the central carbon is attached to:

- Two methyl groups (CH3),
- An -OH,
- A -COOCH3.

So, in this case, two of the substituents are the same (two CH3), so the central carbon is not chiral.

Wait, now I'm confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The propanoate part is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to Carbon 1: CH2(OH), Carbon 3: COOCH3, and two Hs. So, no chiral center there.

But then where is the chiral center? Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-OH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think of 2-hydroxypropanoate as:

The hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO^-.

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, in this structure, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- HOCH2 (Carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3),
- Two Hs.

Therefore, the central carbon (C2) is not a chiral center because it's only connected to two different groups and two Hs. Hence, no chiral center.

Wait, so if that's the case, then methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it can't show optical isomerism.

But then, what about dimethyl fumarate? Let me check.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: CH2=CHCOOCH3 + CH2=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with two ester groups on each carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3).

But wait, fumarate has a double bond, so the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's actually (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH(COOCH3)=CH2.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me recall: fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the second and third carbon.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of (E)-butenedioic acid: so, CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but in that case, each carbon of the double bond has two ester groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, let me clarify. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but actually, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when it's esterified, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, the proper structure is:

The double bond is between the two central carbons. So, each of those carbons is connected to two ester groups: one on each side.

So, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, each carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups? Hmm, perhaps it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but that can't be because then the double bond isn't present. Maybe it's (CH2COOCH3) on each end.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that's if it were succinic acid. Wait, fumaric acid is different.

Actually, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but that would require each carbon of the double bond to have two substituents. So, each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group?

Wait, no, the double bond is between two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but that would be a double bond between two carbons, each connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group on each side.

Wait, hold on, maybe the correct structure is:

O
||
O-CH2-C=CH-COOCH3

No, that's not it either.

Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

So, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 attached to it and a CH2 group connected to the other side. So, the central double bond is between two carbons, each of which has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, so it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3). But that would mean each carbon of the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and CH2.

Wait, but that would make the molecule have a double bond between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group? That can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl 2,3-diene dicarboxylate. So, it's (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, the positions would be 1,2 and 3,4.

Wait, fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

But with the double bond in between.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH2–CH(COOCH3)=CH2.

No, I think I need to clarify the structure.

In fumaric acid, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, when esterified, the structure becomes:

COOCH3–CH2–CH2–COOCH3, but that's if it were succinic acid. For fumaric acid, it's COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3.

So, the central part is CH=CH, with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3.

Therefore, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Wait, so each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each carbon has the groups: COOCH3, H, and two CH groups (each attached to the other CH and the COOCH3).

Wait, no, actually, for the double bond, each carbon is connected to two other groups.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2(COOCH3) double bond CH2(COOCH3).

But that would imply both carbons of the double bond have two CH2(COOCH3) groups, which is not possible.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

Each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 and one H on each side.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

So, each carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Therefore, each carbon of the double bond has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the double bond connects them.

Wait, in that case, each carbon is connected to two identical groups: COOCH3 and CH2.

Wait, but that would mean the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), with the double bond, then each carbon of the double bond has the same substituents: a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, and even if there's a double bond, it may not have chirality.

Wait, but if the double bond is between two identical groups, but in reality, in fumarate, the double bond is between two different groups because of the E configuration.

Wait, no, in fumaric acid, it's (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, in the ester form, it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, but each carbon of the double bond has one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. So, the substituents on each carbon are the same: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group, leading to the same groups on both sides of the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is symmetric, and therefore, even though it's a stereoisomer (E and Z), the molecule itself is not chiral.

Wait, but E and Z isomerism is a type of geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, dimethyl fumarate has E and Z isomers, but they don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, so if methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, then neither shows optical isomerism. But the question says one of them shows optical isomerism, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back. Earlier, I thought methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might have a chiral center if the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. But in that case, the central carbon is attached to two methyl groups, which are identical. So, it's not a chiral center.

But wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- CH(OH),
- COOCH3,
- And another CH3? No, wait, that can't be.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, C2 is attached to:

- C1: CH3,
- C3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- And another CH3? Wait, no, wait, the chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, C2 is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (C1),
- COOCH3 (C3),
- OH,
- And another CH3? Wait, no, in a three-carbon chain, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, but C2 can't have four different groups if C1 and C3 are CH3 and COOCH3 respectively.

Wait, let me write it clearly:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 2: CH(OH)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- And one more group: what is the fourth group on C2?

Wait, in reality, Carbon 2 is a secondary carbon in the chain. So, in this structure, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- And two H atoms.

So, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), with two Hs attached. Therefore, it's attached to three different groups: CH3, COOCH3, and OH, but only three unique groups because two are Hs. So, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right because if that's the case, neither of them has a chiral center. But the question says that one of them does show optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

If the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3, then Carbon 2 is attached to:

- Two CH3 groups,
- An OH,
- And a COOCH3.

So, the substituents are: CH3, CH3, OH, COOCH3.

Thus, two substituents are the same (two CH3 groups), so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe the structure is different. Maybe it's not a straight chain but a cyclic structure? No, the name doesn't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another compound. Let me think: if I have a molecule like 2-hydroxypropanoate ester, maybe it's actually:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is a straight chain, with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, Carbon 2 is CH2, attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH),
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- And two H atoms.

Thus, again, Carbon 2 is not a chiral center.

Wait, so maybe I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Perhaps it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl is on a different carbon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is not a straight chain, but a cyclic ester. No, the name doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The compound is (R)- or (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would imply a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3, then is that possible?

So, the formula would be C5H8O4, but let's confirm:

Propanoate is C3H5O2^-; 2-hydroxypropanoate would be C3H6O3; when esterified with methanol, it becomes C4H8O4.

Wait, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula would be CH3(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Which is C4H8O4.

Wait, in that case, the structure is CH3(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3(OH),
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- And two H atoms.

Therefore, not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the hydroxyl is on a different position. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, maybe the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. So, something like CH2(OH)COOCH3. But that would make it a different compound, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so it's more likely the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, in that structure, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- And another CH3.

Wait, but that would make it CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which is a three-carbon chain with a hydroxyl on C2 and an ester on C3. So, the central C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3,
- C3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- And another CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (COOCH3), OH, and another H. So, only three different groups.

Wait, I'm really confused here. Maybe I need to think of another approach.

Wait, let's think about the possible chiral centers. For optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. So, let's check both compounds.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (C1),
- COOCH3 (C3),
- OH,
- And another H.

So, only three different groups, hence not a chiral center.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)-something, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is CH2 connected to:

- HOCH2 (C1),
- COOCH3 (C3),
- And two Hs.

Thus, it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Maybe it's a five-membered ring, but that's not indicated by the name.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider the possibility that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester, which is CH3-OH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not correct because the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester.

Wait, maybe it's:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is the same as HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is CH2 connected to:

- C1: HOCH2,
- C3: COOCH3,
- And two Hs.

Thus, not a chiral center.

Wait, then if neither methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate nor dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center, why does the question say that one of them shows optical isomerism?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents that can cause stereoisomerism. But dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. The double bond can have E and Z configurations, which are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. So, that's not optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the structure of dimethyl fumarate. If it's a diester with a double bond, and the double bond is between two carbonyl groups, then each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon has two different groups, making it a possibility for E and Z isomerism.

But E and Z isomerism is not the same as optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which dimethyl fumarate doesn't have because each carbon of the double bond has two identical groups (in the case of E isomer) or different, but not four different groups.

Wait, no, each carbon of the double bond in dimethyl fumarate has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each carbon has two different groups, but they are arranged in a certain way for E or Z.

Wait, in that case, if the substituents on each carbon are the same, then the molecule might be meso. But in this case, each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, so they are not the same. Therefore, the E and Z isomerism exists, but that's not optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm stuck. The question says that among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, one will show optical isomerism.

But according to my earlier analysis, neither has a chiral center. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is actually a diastereomer or something else. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's part of a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH2COOCH3)-something. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is cyclic. If it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but that's not indicated by the name.

Wait, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think of the possible structures again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (C2) is CH2 connected to:

- C1: CH2(OH),
- C3: COOCH3,
- And two H atoms.

Thus, no chiral center.

Wait, but if the hydroxyl is on C2 and the ester is also on C2, then maybe C2 is connected to both OH and COOCH3. So, then C2 is CH(OH)(COOCH3), but that would require the structure to have OH and COOCH3 on the same carbon as the other groups.

Wait, but in that case, the structure would be HOCH2-C(OOCH3)-CH3, but that would make it a different compound.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on C2, and the ester on C3.

Wait, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Maybe I should refer to the answer given.

The correct answer is B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But according to my analysis, it doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another approach: Maybe in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the molecule can have a chiral center if the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's connected to four different groups.

Wait, so the
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It asks which one doesn't show tautomerism (A). Then, it asks among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism (B). The correct answers given are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. I need to figure out why that's the case.

Let me start with part A. Tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and a pair of electrons to form a structurally different molecule, often involving functional groups like carbonyls. So, tautomerism is common in molecules with carbonyl groups because they can exist in different forms, like enol and keto.

Benzoquinone is a compound I'm somewhat familiar with. It has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. The structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the ring. So, it looks like a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring where every other carbon is connected to an oxygen atom via a ketone group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions.

Now, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, benzoquinone is fully conjugated. It has two carbonyl groups, but in a ring structure. I don't think there's a way for a hydrogen to shift to form another structure because all the positions adjacent to carbonyl groups are either aromatic or already part of the conjugated system. So, benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? This ring already has three ketone groups, so each carbonyl is part of the ring structure. In such a case, the molecule is quite rigid. Each carbonyl is at a 1,3,5 position, making it a symmetrical structure. In such a symmetrical compound, does tautomerism occur? Well, tautomerism typically happens in molecules with alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbonyl carbons). In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is part of the ring, and the ring is fully saturated except for the ketone groups. Wait, no, it's a triketone, so the ring is actually not fully saturated because the ketones are present.

Wait, hold on. If the molecule is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then each of the three carbonyl groups is connected to the ring. Each carbonyl is adjacent to two carbons, but the carbonyl carbons themselves have only one bond to oxygen. Now, do any of these carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens? For a carbonyl group (C=O), the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl, meaning the two adjacent carbons in the ring.

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. If it's a triketone, then at the 1,3,5 positions, each of those carbons is attached to an oxygen in a ketone group. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2, 4, 6) would have two substituents: one from the ring and one from the carbonyl.

Wait, let's visualize cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a six-membered ring where every other carbon (1,3,5) has a ketone group. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. But wait, in a ring, positions 1,3,5 are each a carbonyl group, so the structure is actually a ring with alternating carbonyl groups. But in such a structure, each carbonyl is part of the ring, meaning that the carbonyl carbons are each connected to two other ring carbons. So, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1,3,5. Therefore, the adjacent carbons (positions 2,4,6) are each connected to two carbons and one oxygen?

Wait, no, wait. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring where carbons 1,3,5 are each connected to an oxygen via a double bond, making them carbonyl groups. So, the structure is like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, but that's not a ring. Wait, no, it's a ring, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but wait, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring where every other carbon (1,3,5) is a ketone. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at positions 1,3,5, meaning the ring has three carbonyl groups. So, each of those carbonyls is at 1,3,5 positions, and the ring alternates between CH2 and CO groups. But wait, the ring is six-membered, so positions 1,3,5 are CO, and 2,4,6 are CH2.

So, the carbons at 2,4,6 are each attached to two CH2 groups. So, the carbonyl carbons (1,3,5) are double-bonded to O, and the adjacent carbons (2,4,6) are single bonded to two CH2 groups.

In such a structure, each of the carbonyl groups (positions 1,3,5) has two adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for position 1, positions 2 and 4 for position 3, positions 4 and 6 for position 5). But in terms of tautomerism, do any of these carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens?

Wait, the alpha carbons for a carbonyl group are the adjacent carbons. In this case, those adjacent carbons (positions 2,4,6) are each attached to two CH2 groups, but wait, no, in a six-membered ring, each position is connected to two others. So, positions 2,4,6 are each connected to positions 1,3 and 3,5,5,1 respectively.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. Let me mentally draw cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

- Position 1: carbonyl (C=O)
- Position 2: CH2
- Position 3: carbonyl (C=O)
- Position 4: CH2
- Position 5: carbonyl (C=O)
- Position 6: CH2

So, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. Therefore, each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, with CH2 groups at 2,4,6.

Now, the alpha carbons for each carbonyl would be the adjacent carbons, which are CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups is connected to two other carbons. So, the carbonyl groups at 1,3,5 have adjacent CH2 groups at 2,6 for position 1; 2,4 for position 3; and 4,6 for position 5.

But wait, in the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups? No, because it's a six-membered ring. So, position 1 is C=O, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is C=O, position 4 is CH2, position 5 is C=O, position 6 is CH2. So, the CH2 groups are between two carbonyls.

Therefore, each CH2 group is an alpha position for two carbonyl groups. So, each CH2 has two carbonyls adjacent to it. Therefore, each CH2 group is an alpha position for two carbonyl groups.

Now, tautomerism requires the presence of an alpha hydrogen (hydrogen attached to an alpha carbon) and the ability to shift that hydrogen to form a different structure. In this case, the CH2 groups have hydrogens, but if a CH2 group is between two carbonyls, would it have an alpha hydrogen that can shift?

Wait, if the CH2 group is between two carbonyls, each of the CH2's hydrogens is an alpha hydrogen relative to both carbonyls. So, for each CH2 group, the hydrogens can potentially shift, but the problem is whether the shifting would lead to a different structure.

But wait, in such a case, shifting a hydrogen from a CH2 group between two carbonyls would require rotation around the C-C bond. But in a ring structure, rotation is restricted. Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, the ring is rigid because of the chair conformation, but in reality, it's actually more flexible.

Wait, but each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. So, each CH2 is part of two carbonyl groups. So, in such a situation, is there any possibility for enolization or keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, maybe not, because the carbonyls are part of the ring, so the structure is quite rigid. Also, the molecule is symmetric, so any tautomerism would result in the same structure because of the symmetry.

Wait, if you have a CH2 group between two carbonyls, and you try to shift a hydrogen from that CH2, you'd end up with a structure that's essentially the same because of the ring's symmetry. So, for example, shifting a hydrogen from position 2 would just result in the same structure because of the ring's symmetry.

Wait, but no, actually, even though the structure is symmetric, the act of shifting a hydrogen from the CH2 group would create a different structure only if the carbonyl groups can reorient. But in reality, the carbonyl groups are fixed in their positions because of the double bonds.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about whether there are any alpha hydrogens in this molecule. Each CH2 group has hydrogens, and those hydrogens are alpha to two carbonyl groups. But if you can't have tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are part of a conjugated system, then the molecule is conjugated, and that might prevent tautomerism.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule is fully conjugated, like in benzoquinone, then any tautomerism would require breaking the conjugation, which is not favorable. So, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have tautomerism because the structure is too rigid and the carbonyl groups are part of a conjugated system, making enolization difficult or impossible.

On the other hand, benzoquinone is a fully conjugated system with two carbonyl groups. It has alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls), but those are part of the aromatic ring. So, any hydrogen shifting would have to occur within the aromatic system, which is not possible because that would disrupt the aromaticity.

Therefore, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't show tautomerism. But the question says that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the possibility of tautomerism. Let me check: in molecules with ketones, tautomerism is possible when there are alpha hydrogens. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 group has two hydrogens, and those are alpha hydrogens relative to the carbonyls. So, in theory, they should have the possibility of tautomerism.

But wait, in a cyclic structure like this, will the tautomerism actually occur? For example, in cyclohexanone, which has a single ketone group, shifting an alpha hydrogen can result in an enol form. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketone groups, the situation is different.

If I try to shift a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups between two carbonyls, would that lead to a different structure? For example, shifting a hydrogen from C2 to form a double bond with C1? But C1 is already double-bonded to O. Similarly, trying to form a double bond with C3 is not possible because C3 is also double-bonded to O.

Wait, so perhaps in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, there's no possibility for tautomerism because any shift would require breaking two double bonds, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, since the molecule is fully conjugated, any tautomerism would require significant structural rearrangement that's not possible without breaking conjugation.

So, considering this, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione may not show tautomerism. But the question specifically identifies A as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Maybe I need to think again.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone does or doesn't have tautomerism. Let me reconsider. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, each ketone is at the 1 and 3 positions. So, the structure is O=C-Ph-O.

Wait, no, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, right? No, wait, no, benzoquinone can be either 1,4 or 1,2. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms, each forming a carbonyl group. So, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the 1 and 3 positions, actually 1,3-cyclohexadienedione or something like that.

Wait, wait, I think it's 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,2-benzoquinone, but more commonly, 1,4-benzoquinone is more stable. So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are at the para positions.

In any case, the point is, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Does it have alpha hydrogens? The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring. So, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which are sp² hybridized, and thus don't have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on sp² carbons). So, in benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring, so they don't have hydrogens attached.

Wait, wait, but in benzoquinone, if it's 1,3-cyclohexadienedione, then the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH groups. But wait, in that case, those CH groups would have hydrogens attached, which would make them alpha hydrogens.

Wait, no, wait. If it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups, then the carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be part of the aromatic ring, which are sp² hybridized. So, they don't have hydrogens attached (since each carbon in benzene is bonded to three things: two carbons and one hydrogen). But if a carbon is part of a carbonyl group (sp² hybridized), then in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two aromatic carbons.

Wait, perhaps in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are connected to the aromatic ring, which doesn't have any hydrogens on the adjacent carbons. So, benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and don't have hydrogens.

Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, so it cannot undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has CH2 groups between the carbonyl groups, and those CH2 groups have hydrogens. So, in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens. So, can it undergo tautomerism? If it can, then it would have enol forms, but in this case, given the ring structure, it's unclear.

Wait, but in a cyclic triketone, the ring is such that each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So, trying to shift a hydrogen from a CH2 group would require breaking the double bonds or the ring itself, which isn't feasible. Therefore, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also doesn't show tautomerism.

But the correct answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, why is that?

Wait, maybe it's because in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is symmetrical, so even though it has alpha hydrogens, it doesn't exhibit tautomerism because all possible tautomers are the same due to symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have the possibility to tautomerize because each carbonyl is part of the ring and shifting a hydrogen would require breaking the ring structure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of three carbonyl groups in the ring may make it more stable, and prevent the shifting of hydrogens because it's a conjugated system. So, maybe both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't show tautomerism, but the question says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm: does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens? Each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So, each hydrogen on the CH2 is alpha to two carbonyl groups.

So, in such a case, the molecule should have alpha hydrogens, making tautomerism possible. However, is there any possibility for enolization?

Wait, in a cyclic structure, enolization would require the breaking of the ring. Or, perhaps, being a conjugated system, it's not possible. So, maybe, despite having alpha hydrogens, it can't tautomerize because the structure is too rigid.

Alternatively, the molecule is fully conjugated, so any tautomerism would disrupt the conjugation.

Wait, but in reality, I think that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a known compound that doesn't exhibit tautomerism because it's a conjugated system and the carbonyl groups are part of a conjugated ring, making enolization unfavorable.

But then, why doesn't benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Because benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups and the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which don't have alpha hydrogens.

So, putting this together: benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens, so no tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens but due to its structure, it doesn't exhibit tautomerism. But why? Or perhaps it does.

Wait, I think I need to refer to some knowledge. The compound cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is known as dione. It's similar to cyclohexanone with three ketone groups.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is part of the ring. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in a ring.

Now, each CH2 group between the carbonyls has two alpha hydrogens. In theory, a keto-enol tautomer is possible. For example, shifting one of the alpha hydrogens to form an enol.

But in a cyclic system like this, would that lead to a different structure? If you have O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, shifting a hydrogen from the CH2 would create a double bond between the CH2 and the adjacent carbonyl. But that would require breaking the ring, which isn't feasible.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to shift a hydrogen to form a conjugated diene, but that would require breaking the conjugated system, which isn't favorable.

So, given that, it's more likely that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't exhibit tautomerism because any tautomerism would require breaking the ring or disrupting the conjugated system.

Therefore, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't have tautomerism. But why does the correct answer say A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, maybe the question is about the presence or absence of tautomerism, not the number. Perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does? But I thought both don't.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Maybe it does have tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of three carbonyl groups in the ring makes it more rigid and less likely to undergo tautomerism.

Wait, another point: the question is about which compound does not show tautomerism. So, if both don't, but the correct answer says cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is A, perhaps it's because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have tautomerism, while benzoquinone doesn't. But that contradicts my initial thought.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think about benzoquinone. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which are sp² hybridized. Therefore, they don't have alpha hydrogens because the sp² carbons in benzene are already bonded to three atoms: two carbons and one hydrogen. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen and two carbons. But in benzoquinone, if the carbonyl is at position 1, then the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) are each bonded to two carbons and one hydrogen. So, do these adjacent carbons have two hydrogens?

Wait, in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. When you substitute a hydrogen with a carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons still have one hydrogen each. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl in benzoquinone have one hydrogen each.

Therefore, in benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2 and 6 for position 1 carbonyl) have one hydrogen each. So, they are alpha carbons with one hydrogen each. Therefore, they have alpha hydrogens.

So, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Because it has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are on the benzene ring. So, can a hydrogen be shifted from the benzene ring to form a tautomer?

Wait, but in the case of aromatic compounds, like benzophenone, which has a methyl ketone, the alpha hydrogens are on the methyl group, which can undergo enolization.

But in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are on the aromatic ring, which is conjugated. So, moving an alpha hydrogen from the aromatic ring would require breaking the aromaticity, which is not favorable.

Therefore, in benzoquinone, even though there are alpha hydrogens, they are part of the conjugated aromatic system, making tautomerism highly unlikely or impossible because it would disrupt aromaticity.

On the other hand, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha hydrogens are on CH2 groups, which are not conjugated. So, in this case, the molecule can undergo tautomerism because the CH2 groups can enolize without disrupting the conjugated system.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups in a ring. The CH2 groups are between the carbonyls. So, each CH2 has two hydrogens, which are alpha hydrogens.

Therefore, in such a case, the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, shifting a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups to form an enol.

So, perhaps benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are part of the conjugated aromatic system, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism because its alpha hydrogens are on non-conjugated CH2 groups.

Wait, but in reality, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system as well because it's a cyclic diketone, so the three carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring. Therefore, any enolization would disrupt the conjugation.

Hmm, now I'm confused.

Perhaps another approach: the presence of tautomerism usually requires the molecule to have alpha hydrogens. Both compounds have alpha hydrogens, but due to their structure, one might not exhibit tautomerism.

Wait, in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are on the aromatic ring, which is conjugated. So, even though they are alpha hydrogens, they are not able to shift because that would break conjugation. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha hydrogens are on CH2 groups not involved in conjugation. So, perhaps in that case, they can shift, allowing tautomerism.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot because its alpha hydrogens are part of a conjugated system.

But wait, no. In reality, for enolization (tautomerism), the alpha hydrogen needs to shift to a carbonyl group, but in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are already part of the conjugated system.

Wait, maybe it's impossible in both cases because in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are part of the aromatic ring and in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is too rigid.

Wait, I think I need to look up whether cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.

Upon thinking, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is known as a cyclic diketone, and it's similar to cyclohexanone but with three ketone groups. Such cyclic diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if they have adjacent alpha hydrogens.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, so each CH2 has two alpha hydrogens. Therefore, it can undergo tautomerism by enolization.

In contrast, benzoquinone is fully conjugated, so shifting an alpha hydrogen would disrupt the aromatic system, which is not favorable. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, due to the conjugated system, tautomerism isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe because the molecule is cyclic and highly conjugated, it doesn't allow for tautomerism.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the enol form would require a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl, which is already present in the conjugated system. So, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, maybe my confusion arises from the fact that both molecules have conjugated carbonyl groups but different structures.

Perhaps in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are conjugated through the aromatic ring, making enolization unlikely. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are conjugated through the ring, but the CH2 groups allow for tautomerism.

Wait, I think I need to conclude based on the given answer. The correct answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, implying that it doesn't show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does or does not. But the question is asking which one does NOT show tautomerism.

Wait, let me re-examine the question: "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)".

So, A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, and the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Therefore, why doesn't cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione show tautomerism?

Perhaps because it's a cyclic system with three carbonyl groups, making it highly conjugated, so tautomerism is not observed.

Alternatively, maybe it's because the compound is symmetric and any tautomerism would lead back to the same structure, so it doesn't exhibit it.

But more likely, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the tautomerism is possible, but since it's a cyclic system, it cannot tautomerize without breaking the ring, which is not favorable.

Wait, in reality, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a known compound, and I think it does show tautomerism because it can form an enol. So, if that's the case, why is the correct answer saying it doesn't?

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to whether they can exist as enols, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, it's more stable in the keto form, so the tautomerism is not evident or not energetically favorable. However, in theory, it can still tautomerize.

But the correct answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, implying that it doesn't show tautomerism. So, perhaps in practice, it doesn't.

Alternatively, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are too rigid, making tautomerism impossible.

Wait, perhaps it's due to the number of carbonyl groups. With three carbonyl groups, the compound is more stable and less likely to undergo tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is misassigned, but given that, perhaps the assumption is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism because it's a fully conjugated cyclic system, making it more stable and preventing tautomerism, while benzoquinone, also a conjugated system, doesn't show tautomerism either. But why is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione considered as the one that doesn't show tautomerism?

Wait, maybe the key is that in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, so tautomerism is not possible, while in benzoquinone, perhaps tautomerism is not possible either, but the question is referring to which one doesn't show it, so both don't, but the answer says cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question says: "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)".

So, perhaps benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Therefore, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the one that does not show tautomerism.

But earlier, I thought cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does or does not. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of double bonds. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated through the aromatic ring, so they are part of a conjugated system, making tautomerism less likely. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl group is isolated, but actually, in a six-membered ring, the carbonyls are conjugated, making the molecule a conjugated cyclic system.

Wait, maybe the confusion is arising from the term "tautomerism". Tautomerism typically refers to keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of alpha hydrogens. So, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, but only one of them undergoes tautomerism.

Wait, in benzoquinone, the alpha hydrogens are on the aromatic ring. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha hydrogens are on CH2 groups, which are not conjugated. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, while benzoquinone cannot because its alpha hydrogens are part of the conjugated aromatic system.

Therefore, if the question is about which one doesn't show tautomerism, the answer would be benzoquinone. But the correct answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should accept that the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, and proceed to part B, which is about optical isomerism.

Moving on to part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism, also known as stereoisomerism, occurs when a molecule has stereogenic centers or planes of symmetry that can be arranged in a way that is a non-superimposable mirror image.

So, let's analyze both compounds.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write its structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

- A central carbon (the 2nd carbon) connected to:
  - An -OH group (hydroxyl),
  - An -OCH3 group (methyl ester),
  - And two CH3 groups.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's more accurate. So, it's a four-carbon molecule where the second carbon has an OH group and an ester group.

Alternatively, it's (CH2)2(OH)COOCH3, but I need to visualize the structure correctly.

Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. As an ester, the -OH would be replaced by an OCH3, but no, wait, methyl ester is OCH3.

Wait, no, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the ester is on the propanoic acid, so the structure is:

The propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, with the -OH on the second carbon. The ester would be formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3.

Wait, actually, the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon) has an -OH, a CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH3 groups.

Wait
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, the question is asking about two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It wants to know which one does not show tautomerism, labeled as compound A. Then, among two other compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, it's asking which one shows optical isomerism, labeled as compound B. The correct answers are given as A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, but I need to figure out why that's the case.

Let me start with part A: identifying which compound does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen atoms accompanied by a change in the position of a double bond, leading to different structures but the same molecular formula. Common examples include enols and ketones, or ketones and enols.

Looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Its structure is a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms, each with a double bond to the ring. So, benzoquinone has the structure O=C-C6H4-C=O. I don't think it can undergo tautomerism because both oxygen atoms are double-bonded to the ring, and there aren't any hydrogen atoms adjacent to double bonds that can shift to form another structure. So, benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This compound has a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, each of these positions has a carbonyl group. Let me draw this in my mind: a ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl. So, the structure is like O=C-C-C-O=C-C-C-O=C. Now, in such a structure, can tautomerism occur? Well, each carbonyl has a double bond, but the positions of the double bonds are fixed because it's a ring. However, each carbonyl is between two CH2 groups. Wait, but in such a structure, can any hydrogen adjacent to a double bond be moved to form a different structure?

In other words, each ketone group is at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl is O=C-, so the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. But in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two others, so is there a possibility for a hydrogen on a CH2 group to shift to form a different double bond structure?

Wait, let me think: for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen attached to a carbon that's connected to a double bond, right? So, for example, in a carbonyl group, the structure is R-C=O. If there's another hydrogen adjacent (like on the same carbon or adjacent), you can shift it. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, but in a six-membered ring, each ketone is at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, for example, position 1 is a carbonyl, connected to position 2 and 6. Position 2 is CH2, position 6 is CH2. Similarly for positions 3 and 5. So, each of these carbonyls is flanked by CH2 groups.

So, can a hydrogen from position 2 or 6 (which are CH2) shift to form a different double bond? If a hydrogen from position 2 moves to form a double bond with position 1, that would make the structure O=C-CH2-..., but position 1 is already a carbonyl. Wait, maybe that's possible? Let me think.

If a hydrogen from position 2 moves to form a double bond with position 1, then position 1 would become an enol, and position 2 would become a double bond. But position 1 is already a carbonyl, so would that create a different structure? Hmm, maybe, but in a ring, how would that affect the overall structure?

Alternatively, maybe each ketone can tautomerize independently, but given the ring structure, the positions are fixed. Wait, but in a cyclic compound, tautomerism is less likely because the ring constrains the structure. So, for example, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, but in a 1,3,5-trione, maybe it's not possible because each carbonyl is too far apart.

Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic trione, which is similar to a cyclic diketone but with three ketone groups. So, each carbonyl is on alternate positions in the ring. So, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So, for tautomerism, you would need a hydrogen that can shift from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a regular ketone, you have R-CO-R', and the adjacent carbon can have a hydrogen that can shift to form an enol.

But in a cyclic trione, each carbonyl is between two CH2 groups. So, for instance, between the two carbonyls at positions 1 and 3, there are CH2 groups at positions 2 and 4. So, the hydrogen on position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (a carbonyl). So, could that hydrogen shift to form a double bond between positions 1 and 2? That would create a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, if position 1 is a carbonyl (O=C-), position 2 is CH2. If a hydrogen from position 2 shifts to form a double bond between C1 and C2, then position 1 would become an enol, and position 2 would have a double bond. However, position 1 is already a carbonyl. So, would that create a different structure?

Alternatively, perhaps in such a constrained ring, the tautomerism is not possible because the double bonds are part of the ring structure, and you can't just break one double bond to form another without disrupting the ring.

Wait, another thought: in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is O=C-C-C-O=C-C-C-O=C. So, each carbonyl is separated by a single bond. If you have a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, can it shift to form a double bond? Let me imagine: if the hydrogen on the CH2 between two carbonyls shifts to form a double bond, it would create a conjugated system.

But in a six-membered ring, the conjugation might be possible. So, maybe tautomerism occurs where the double bonds shift. For example, carbonyl groups can shift positions, moving along the ring.

Wait, actually, in the case of 1,3,5-trione, the double bonds are already part of the ring. So, if you have O=C-C-C-O=C-C-C-O=C, each 'C' is a CH2 except for the carbonyls. So, if a hydrogen on one of the CH2 groups shifts to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl, that might create a new tautomer.

Wait, but in this case, the compound is fully conjugated as a cyclic diketone. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is similar to a cyclic structure where each carbonyl is at equal intervals. So, perhaps that structure is more rigid, and doesn't allow for tautomerism because all the double bonds are part of the ring and can't be broken or shifted without breaking the ring structure.

In contrast, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Since the benzene ring is conjugated, but each ketone is on a separate carbon. So, in benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. Wait, benzoquinone is either 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone, depending on the substitution. Wait, but benzoquinone is usually 1,4-benzoquinone, which is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms at positions 1 and 4, each with a double bond to the ring.

So, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the oxygen atoms are at opposite ends of the ring. Each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring, and the other bonds are single. So, in this case, can tautomerism occur? Well, the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Each oxygen is double-bonded, so each carbonyl is on a carbon with a double bond to O. The adjacent carbons are CH groups in the ring.

Wait, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH groups, each attached to two ring carbons. So, for each carbonyl, the adjacent carbons are CH. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two CH groups. So, in this case, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two CH groups.

So, can a hydrogen on a CH group shift to form an enol? Let me see: If a hydrogen on one of the CH groups next to a carbonyl shifts to form a double bond, it would create an enol structure. However, in a benzene ring, the carbons are all conjugated. So, shifting a hydrogen to form a double bond would disrupt the aromaticity.

Wait, but benzoquinone is not an aromatic compound because it has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing, making the ring non-aromatic. So, it's a conjugated quinone structure, but not aromatic.

So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon, and each of those carbons is connected to two CH groups. So, each carbonyl is connected to two CH groups, which have hydrogens that could potentially shift to form an enol.

So, can this happen? If a hydrogen from a CH group shifts to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl carbon, creating an enol, but in this case, the ring is already conjugated. So, would that cause a different tautomer?

Wait, I think in benzoquinone, the ring is conjugated, so shifting a hydrogen to form a double bond might lead to another conjugated system. But in this case, since the ring is already fully conjugated, maybe tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a separate carbon, and moving a hydrogen from an adjacent CH group to form a double bond would result in two double bonds. But a benzene ring can't have more than one double bond unless it's part of a conjugated system.

Wait, but benzoquinone already has two double bonds (the two carbonyls). If another double bond is formed, that might create a cumulene or something else, which is less stable. So, maybe tautomerism is not favorable here because it would lead to a less stable structure.

Alternatively, maybe the tautomerism isn't feasible in this case because the compound is already a conjugated system, and shifting a hydrogen would lead to a different structure that's less stable.

But I'm not entirely sure about benzoquinone. Let me consider another approach: checking if either compound has the possibility of keto-enol tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a single bond, so each has an adjacent CH2 group. Each CH2 group has two hydrogens. So, the possibility exists for a hydrogen to shift from CH2 to form a double bond.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are each two carbons apart. So, positions 1, 3, 5 are carbonyls, with CH2 groups in between.

So, between positions 1 and 3, you have positions 2 and 4 as CH2. So, each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Therefore, each of these CH2 groups has a hydrogen that could potentially shift to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl.

Therefore, tautomerism is possible in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Because each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond, creating an enol form.

But in benzoquinone, the situation is different. Each carbonyl is on a carbon adjacent to two CH groups, but because it's a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds, the possibility of forming another double bond is less likely because it would disrupt the conjugation and possibly lead to a non-planar or non-conjugated system, which is less stable.

Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is asking which compound does not show tautomerism, so A is the one without tautomerism. So, benzoquinone is A.

Wait, but the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which contradicts my conclusion. So, maybe I have it backwards.

Wait, hold on, the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, if the question is asking which compound does not show tautomerism, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one without tautomerism, which means benzoquinone does show tautomerism. But I thought benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about benzoquinone. Let me think again.

In benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So, two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are on opposite carbons, so positions 1 and 4, with three carbons in between.

Wait, so in 1,4-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected via single bonds to two other carbons, which are CH groups.

So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two CH groups. So, each CH group is adjacent to a carbonyl.

In such a case, each CH group can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl carbon, leading to an enol form.

But in this case, because it's a benzene ring, forming a double bond would disrupt the aromaticity, but since benzoquinone isn't aromatic because of the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, the conjugation is different.

Wait, but forming a double bond would create another double bond in the ring, which could lead to a more conjugated system. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible here, leading to a more extended conjugation.

But then, in that case, benzoquinone would show tautomerism. So, if that's the case, then the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? But that doesn't make sense because we were earlier thinking that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Wait, maybe I got confused between the two compounds.

Wait, let's re-examine: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring, each separated by a single bond. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the adjacent carbons are CH2. So, each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, each CH2 can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl, leading to tautomerism.

In benzoquinone, the carbonyls are on carbons that are each connected to two CH groups. So, each CH group is adjacent to a carbonyl, so they can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond.

So, both compounds can undergo tautomerism. But perhaps the question is considering the possibility of enolization. Wait, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is part of a ring, which makes tautomerism less possible, whereas in benzoquinone, it's a straight chain or a conjugated system.

Wait, another thought: in cyclic compounds, tautomerism is less likely because the ring restricts the movement needed for tautomerism. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is rigid, so tautomerism is not possible.

But in benzoquinone, even though it's cyclic, the structure allows for the shifting of double bonds because it's a conjugated system. So, benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, so A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Let me research: I think that in cyclic ketones, tautomerism is possible. For example, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism by shifting a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl to form a double bond, which would change the position of the double bond.

So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, there are three possible sites for tautomerism: each carbonyl can have a hydrogen shifted to form an enol. So, yes, it can show tautomerism.

In contrast, benzoquinone, which is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups, may not show tautomerism because the structure is more rigid or maybe because the additional double bonds make it less likely.

Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone can also undergo tautomerism. For example, 1,4-benzoquinone can lose a hydrogen from a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl to form a different enol form.

Wait, but in both cases, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. So, perhaps neither of them is the answer. But the question is in the context of the given options, so perhaps one of them can't.

Alternatively, perhaps in benzoquinone, tautomerism is not possible because shifting a hydrogen would require breaking a ring bond, which is not feasible. So, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, that makes sense because in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, to form an enol, you would need to break one of the ring bonds or form a new double bond, which would change the structure entirely.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone cannot tautomerize because it's a planar molecule, and tautomerism would require non-planar structures.

Wait, I'm getting too confused here. Maybe I should look up if benzoquinone shows tautomerism.

After a quick check in my mind, I think benzoquinone can tautomerize to form its enol form, which is less stable but still possible. So, perhaps both compounds can show tautomerism. Then, why does the answer say that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism?

Wait, another angle: maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the compound is fully conjugated, and tautomerism is not possible because all double bonds are part of the ring. So, you can't shift the double bonds without breaking the ring, which would not form a tautomer but a completely different molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps because in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, all the carbons are either carbonyls or single bonds, so there are no CH2 groups with hydrogens that can shift.

Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between the carbonyls. So, each CH2 is next to a carbonyl, so there are hydrogens that can shift.

Wait, maybe it's just a matter of whether the tautomerism is feasible. In the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups, but each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, each CH2 has two hydrogens. So, each of those hydrogens can shift to form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl.

So, in this way, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, meaning it can show tautomerism.

In contrast, benzoquinone has two carbonyls, each adjacent to CH groups, which can shift to form enol forms.

So, both can tautomerize. Therefore, I'm confused why the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Wait, maybe it's because in benzoquinone, the hydrogen shifts would lead to different positions, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the positions are symmetric, so tautomerism would not result in a different compound.

Wait, for example, in benzoquinone, if a hydrogen shifts from one CH group to form an enol, it would create a specific stereoisomer, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, since the ring is symmetric, shifting any hydrogen would result in the same compound because of the identical positions.

Therefore, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, tautomerism doesn't lead to a different compound because of symmetry, so it doesn't show tautomerism.

Whereas in benzoquinone, tautomerism leads to a different compound because the positions are different, so it can show tautomerism.

Wait, that seems plausible. So, for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, all possible tautomer forms are actually the same due to the symmetry of the molecule, so it doesn't show tautomerism. But benzoquinone can form a different tautomer because the positions are asymmetric.

So, in that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism because the enol forms are identical to the original due to symmetry, so there's no distinct tautomer.

Therefore, the answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione because it doesn't show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does.

Moving on to part B: which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center and an asymmetric carbon. So, we need to check if either of these compounds have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write its structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is an ester with methyl. So, the structure is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, so the ester would be methyl ester, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, wait: wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the acid.

So, the structure is:

Carboxylic acid: HOOC-CH2-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with an OCH3. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so that would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's clarify.

Propanoate: The acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the ester would have the structure R-OOC-CH2-CH2-.

But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the acid. So, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the ester would be CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with a -O-R group. So, in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the ester would be R-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that would make it a diol ester, which isn't the case.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. To make the ester, you replace the -OH of the acid with a -OCH3. So, the ester becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But wait, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester, isn't it? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons.

Propanoic acid has three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon, so it's COOH-CH(OH)-CH3.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so the ester is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So, the central carbon (where the hydroxyl is attached) is connected to:

- A hydroxyl group,
- A carbonyl group (from the ester),
- A CH3 group (from the ester),
- And a CH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

Propanoic acid: Carboxylic acid group is on C1, then C2, then C3.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid: -COOH on C1, -OH on C2, and C3 is CH3.

So, the structure is: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3.

Esterification replaces the -OH of the acid with -OCH3. So, the ester is: OCOCH3-O-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no.

Wait, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with an -OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So, the molecule is:

CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but that's not possible because that would imply the ester is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl. Hmm, maybe I need to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure as:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, on the central carbon (C2), we have a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from the ester), and two more groups: the carbonyl from the ester and a CH3 group.

Wait, let's list the attachments on the C2:

1. Hydroxyl (-OH)
2. Carbonyl (from the ester, which is O-CO-OCH3)
3. CH3 group
4. Another CH3 group (from the first carbon of the ester)

Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as:

Carbonyl-OCH3 connected to a carbon that is connected to a hydroxyl and a CH3.

So, the structure is:

O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(CH2OH)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, wait. Let me try again.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. When it's esterified with methanol, the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, that would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) has CH2(OH) attached, then C3 is CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not a chiral center.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me identify the structure properly.

Propanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOCH2CH2COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COO-CH3.

Looking at this, the central CH2 groups: the second carbon is CH2 connected to the hydroxyl, and the third carbon is CH2 connected to the ester.

But in this structure, there is a chiral center? Let's check.

The second carbon (C2) is connected to:

- A hydroxyl (-OH)
- Two CH2 groups (one connected to C1, the other to C3)
- And another CH2 group (from C3's position).

Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is HO-CH2-
- C3: which is CH2-COOCH3
- Two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no, that can't be. If the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and another group.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2, connected to C1 (HO-CH2-), C3 (CH2-COOCH3), and two hydrogens.

So, the second carbon has four substituents: two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen.

So, the second carbon is not a chiral center because it's attached to two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, two CH2 groups, but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no, in the structure HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, each CH2 is a separate group. So, C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH2-OH
- C3: CH2-COOCH3
- Two H atoms.

So, the groups attached to C2 are: two CH2 groups (C1 and C3), a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen. So, that's four different groups, making C2 a chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center on C2, so it can show optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. So, dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, so its structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, actually, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, it's a conjugated diacid with a double bond between C1 and C2. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is the ester where both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methyl groups.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3

connected to CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with a double bond? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 on both ends? Wait, no, that would be for maleic acid. Fumaric acid has double bonds at the end.

Wait, I think fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that can't be because that wouldn't have a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, which is similar to maleic acid but with the double bond between the two central carbons.

So, dimethyl fumarate is the ester where both the carboxylic acid groups are replaced with -OCH3.

So, structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3

on both ends:

HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H → (esterified with CH3OH) → CH2=CH-COOCH3 on both ends? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, when you esterify a diacid, you have two ester groups.

So, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H.

Esterification with methanol would give dimethyl fumarate as:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3

on both the C1 and C4 positions, with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, no, because fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H.

When you esterify both carboxylic acid groups, you get:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3

on both the first and fourth carbons, so the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3, but
