[recurrent thinking]
Okay, so I have this question about 8-bit two's-complement numbers and overflow. The question is asking which pair, when added together, will result in an overflow. The options are A through D, each with two 8-bit numbers. I need to figure out why option A is the correct answer. Let me start by recalling some basics about two's-complement representation and overflow.

First, two's-complement is a method used to represent negative numbers in binary form. For an 8-bit number, the two's-complement is obtained by inverting the bits and then adding 1. This makes the number negative. So, in an 8-bit system, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. If it's 0, the number is positive; if it's 1, the number is negative.

Now, when adding two numbers in two's-complement, if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented in the given number of bits, an overflow occurs. Since we're dealing with 8-bit numbers, the maximum positive value is 01111111 (which is 127 in decimal), and the minimum negative value is 10000000 (which is -128 in decimal). Any sum that goes beyond these will cause an overflow.

Looking at the options, each option has two 8-bit numbers. Let me go through each one step by step.

Option A: 11111111, 00000001

Let me convert these to decimal to see what they represent.

11111111 in binary is 255 in decimal, which is the maximum positive value in 8 bits. 00000001 in binary is 1 in decimal.

Adding them together: 255 + 1 = 256.

Now, what is the maximum value we can have without overflow in 8 bits? It's 127. So 255 is already beyond that, but we're adding another positive number. Wait, actually, in two's-complement, we can have negative numbers as well. So, when adding two positive numbers, does the sum wrap around? Let me think.

Wait, in 8-bit two's-complement, the maximum value is 01111111 (127) and the minimum is 10000000 (-128). So, if we add two positive numbers, the sum can go up to 255 (11111111). But, when we add 255 (which is 11111111) and 1, we get 256. Now, in 8-bit two's-complement, 256 can't be represented because 9 bits are needed (100000000). So, does this cause an overflow?

Wait, but in an 8-bit system, when you add two positive numbers, if their sum is more than 127, it actually wraps around to negative numbers. Let me check:

255 is 127 + 128, so adding 255 (which is 127 + 128) and 1 (127 + 1) would give 256, which is 128 + 128, but in two's-complement, 128 is represented as 10000000 (-128). So 256 is 128 + 128, which would be 10000000 + 10000000 in two's-complement, but adding those two would give 0 with an overflow.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I need to think about how addition works with carry-over in two's-complement.

Let me perform the addition step by step.

Adding 11111111 (255) and 00000001 (1):

Start from the rightmost bit:

1 + 1 = 10. So, write down 0 and carry over 1.

Next bit: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.

This continues for all 8 bits. Since both numbers have all 1s except the last bit, adding them would result in all 0s with a carry-over at each bit. However, since it's 8 bits, the carry-over after the 8th bit would result in a 9th bit. Therefore, the sum would be 100000000, which is 256 in decimal. But in an 8-bit two's-complement system, we can't represent 256, so it overflows.

So, in this case, the sum is 256, which is outside the 8-bit range, so it causes an overflow. Therefore, option A results in overflow.

Moving on to option B: 00000001, 10000000

Converting these to decimal: 00000001 is 1, 10000000 is -128.

Adding them: 1 + (-128) = -127.

What's the range for 8-bit two's-complement? The minimum is -128, and the maximum is 127. So, -127 is within the range, so no overflow occurs here. Therefore, option B does not cause an overflow.

Option C: 11111111, 10000001

Converting to decimal: 11111111 is 255, 10000001 is 129.

Adding them: 255 + 129 = 384.

Now, 384 in binary is 110000000, which is a 9-bit number. So, in an 8-bit system, this would cause an overflow. But let me check if adding them in two's-complement would result in that.

Wait, 11111111 is 255, and 10000001 is 129.

Adding them:

Let's perform the addition:

Start from the right:

1 + 1 = 10. Write 0, carry 1.

Next bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 10. Write 0, carry 1.

This continues until the 8th bit:

The leftmost bit of 11111111 is 1, and 10000001 has 1 as the second bit. Wait, actually, 10000001 is:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.

Wait, when adding 11111111 (all 1s) and 10000001, let's do it step by step.

Let me write them vertically:

  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
+ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
--------------------
  
Starting from the right:

1 + 1 = 0 with carry 1.

Next bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carry 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carry 1.

Same for all bits except the 8th bit (leftmost):

First bit: 1 + 1 = 0 with carry 1, but since it's the leftmost bit, we have another carry-over.

So, the result is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 with a carry-over. So, in 8 bits, that would be 00000000 with a carry-over, so it overflows. But wait, the sum is 256, which is outside the 8-bit range.

But in two's-complement, adding 255 (11111111) and 129 (10000001) gives 384. However, in an 8-bit system, does this cause an overflow? Because 384 is larger than 255, which is the maximum positive value, but 255 is already beyond the maximum positive 8-bit number, which is 127. So, actually, adding 255 and 129, which are both positive numbers, the sum is 384, which can't be represented as an 8-bit number. So, it overflows.

Wait, but in two's-complement, when adding positive numbers that sum beyond the maximum positive value, does it wrap around into the negative numbers?

Wait, no. Because in two's-complement, the range is from -128 to 127. If you add two positive numbers and get a result larger than 127, it's considered an overflow. For example, adding 127 and 1 gives 128, which is beyond 127, so it overflows into a negative number? Wait, no. Actually, in 8-bit two's-complement, the next number after 127 is 128, which is -128 in two's-complement. So, 128 overflows into -128. So, does adding 127 and 1 (128) cause an overflow?

Wait, 127 + 1 = 128, which is outside the 8-bit two's-complement range. So, it overflows. So, yes, 384 is way beyond 127, so adding 255 and 129 causes an overflow. So, option C also causes an overflow.

Wait, that can't be, because in the question, it's stated that the correct answer is A. So, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. Let me check again.

Wait, 255 is 11111111, which is the representation of 255. 129 is 10000001, which is 129. So, adding them together:

255 + 129 = 384.

In 8-bit two's-complement, numbers can't exceed 127 as positive numbers. So, 384 is way beyond, but in two's-complement, if you add numbers beyond 127, they wrap around into negative numbers. But 384 is a positive number beyond 127, but in two's-complement, how does it represent beyond 127?

Wait, 128 in two's-complement is 10000000, which is -128. So, adding 255 and 129, which is 384, is like adding 255 and 129, which is 384, but 384 is 3*128, so 3*(-128) in two's-complement? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should perform the addition in two's-complement.

So, adding 11111111 (255) and 10000001 (129).

Let me perform the addition step by step in binary.

  11111111
+ 10000001
-----------

Starting from the right:

First bit: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Second bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Third bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Fourth bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Fifth bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Sixth bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Seventh bit: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.

Eighth bit: 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 with carryover 1.

Wait, so the eighth bit sum is 1 (from first number) + 0 (from second number) + 1 (carry) = 10. So, write 0 and carry over 1. But since we're at the eighth bit, the carryover will go into a ninth bit.

So, the result is 00000000 with a carryover of 1. So, the sum is 00000000 in 8 bits, and the carryover is 1, which is lost because we don't have a ninth bit. So, effectively, the sum is 00000000, but with a carryover, which means it's an overflow.

Therefore, adding these two numbers results in an overflow because the carryover cannot be accommodated within the 8 bits. So, both option A and option C seem to cause overflow.

But the problem states that the correct answer is option A. So, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in the case of option A: 11111111 (255) and 00000001 (1). So, 255 + 1 = 256, which is beyond 127, but in two's-complement, 256 would be represented as 100000000, which is 9 bits. So, in 8 bits, it overflows. So, that's an overflow.

In option C: 255 + 129 = 384. 384 in 8 bits is 110000000, which is 9 bits. So, again, an overflow.

Wait, so both A and C cause overflow? But the correct answer is A. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read again.

The question says: "Which of the following pairs of 8-bit, two's-complement numbers will result in overflow when the members of the pairs are added?"

So, if adding them causes an overflow, which means that the sum can't be represented in 8 bits. So, both A and C cause overflow?

Hmm, perhaps the question is referring to arithmetic overflow, not just overflow beyond the maximum value. Maybe I need to consider that when you add two numbers, if the sum causes the result to exceed the maximum value for the given number of bits, it overflows.

But in both cases, A and C, the sum is beyond 127, which is the maximum positive value in 8 bits. So, both of them would overflow.

Wait, maybe the question is only referring to positive numbers, or maybe the overflow is considered differently when one of the numbers is negative.

Wait, in option A, both numbers are positive: 255 and 1. So, adding them gives 256, which is beyond the positive range, so it overflows.

In option C, both numbers are positive as well: 255 and 129. Their sum is 384, which is beyond 127, so it overflows.

Wait, but the question says "pairs of 8-bit, two's-complement numbers". So, each pair consists of two numbers, but one of them might be negative, and the other positive.

Wait, maybe I should check all options again.

Option A: 11111111 (255), 00000001 (1). Both positive. Sum is 256, which is beyond 127. So, it overflows.

Option B: 00000001 (1), 10000000 (-128). Sum is -127, which is within the range. So, no overflow.

Option C: 11111111 (255), 10000001 (129). Both positive. Sum is 384, which is beyond 127. So, it overflows.

Option D: 10000001 (129), 10101010 (170). Wait, 10101010 is positive, right? Because the MSB is 1, but in two's-complement, if the number is positive, the MSB is 0. Wait, hold on.

Wait, actually, in two's-complement, the MSB is 1 for negative numbers and 0 for positive numbers. So, 10101010 has MSB 1, which means it's a negative number.

Let me convert 10101010 to decimal. Let's see:

10101010 is 128 + 32 + 8 = 168? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 128 + 32 is 160, plus 8 is 168. So, 10101010 is 168? Wait, but in two's-complement, if the MSB is 1, it should be a negative number.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.

In two's-complement, the number is negative if the MSB is 1. So, 10101010 is negative. To find its decimal value, we can compute the two's-complement.

First, invert the bits of 10101010:

01010101

Then add 1: 01010110.

So, 01010110 is 90 in decimal. Therefore, 10101010 is -90.

So, in option D: 10000001 (129) and 10101010 (-90). So, adding 129 and (-90) gives 39, which is within the 8-bit range. So, no overflow.

Wait, but 129 is 10000001, which is positive, and 10101010 is negative, as I just found. So, 129 + (-90) is 39, which is within -128 to 127. So, no overflow.

So, now, let me summarize:

Option A: 255 + 1 = 256. 256 is beyond 127, so overflow.

Option B: 1 + (-128) = -127. Within range, no overflow.

Option C: 255 + 129 = 384. Beyond 127, so overflow.

Option D: 129 + (-90) = 39. Within range, no overflow.

But wait, the problem says "the correct answer is A". So, maybe there is something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that when adding two positive numbers, if the sum exceeds 127, it overflows, but if you add a positive and a negative number, sometimes it can also overflow, but depending on the combination.

Wait, in option A, both numbers are positive, so adding them can't "underflow" into negative numbers. So, maybe the question is only considering positive numbers, but I think in two's-complement addition, positive numbers can add beyond the maximum positive and wrap into negative.

But if we add two positive numbers beyond the maximum positive, it's an overflow. Similarly, if we add a positive number and a negative number to get a result beyond the maximum positive or minimum negative, it's an overflow.

But in this case, both A and C seem to cause overflow. So, why is the answer only A?

Wait, perhaps the way the numbers are added in two's-complement, sometimes an overflow can be considered as an underflow? Or maybe the question is specifically referring to adding two's-complement numbers taking into account their sign.

Wait, 11111111 is 255 (positive), and 00000001 is 1 (positive). So, their sum is 256. In an 8-bit system, 256 is outside the maximum, so it overflows. So, that's clear.

For option C: 11111111 is 255 (positive), and 10000001 is 129 (positive). So, their sum is 384, which is also outside the 8-bit maximum, so it overflows.

Therefore, both A and C cause overflow.

But the question says the correct answer is A, which suggests that maybe only A causes overflow, which is conflicting with my thought.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the range of the sum. For an 8-bit two's-complement number, the sum must be representable within the 8 bits. If the sum is outside the range, it overflows.

So, in option A: 255 + 1 = 256. 256 is 100000000, which is 9 bits. So, it can't be represented in 8 bits, causing overflow.

In option C: 255 + 129 = 384, which is 110000000, which is also 9 bits. So, same as above, it overflows.

Therefore, both A and C cause overflow. So, perhaps the question is wrong, or maybe I misunderstood the question.

Alternatively, maybe in some cases, adding positive and negative numbers can also cause overflow, but in this case, both A and C are adding positive numbers, resulting in sum beyond the maximum positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to 8-bit signed addition, where the overflow occurs when the sum is beyond 127 or below -128. So, the overflow is considered when the result is outside the range of -128 to 127. So, both A and C are outside that range.

But again, the question says the correct answer is A, so maybe I need to check the addition again.

Wait, let's do the addition for A again.

11111111 (255) + 00000001 (1):

Adding the two numbers in two's-complement:

Start from the right:

1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.

Next: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.

All bits are 1s except the last one, so each addition will produce 0 with carryover 1. After the 8th bit, we have a carryover which can't be represented, so it's an overflow.

Sum is 00000000 with a carryover, meaning 256, which is beyond 8 bits.

So, A definitely causes overflow.

For C: 255 + 129.

Converting 129 to two's-complement: 10000001.

Adding 11111111 and 10000001:

Let me add them in binary:

11111111
+10000001
=?

Start from the right:

1 +1=0, carryover1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1+0+1=0,carry1

1+0+1=0,carry1

1+0+1=0,carry1

1+0+1=0,carry1

1+0+1=0,carry1

1+1+1=1,carry1

Wait, hold on, the eighth bit:

1 (from first number) + 0 (from second number) + 1 (carry) = 10. So, write 0 and carryover 1.

But since it's the eighth bit, that carryover goes into a ninth bit, which is not present. So, it's an overflow.

Therefore, the result is 00000000 with a carryover, which is 256, same as in A. So, same as A, it overflows.

But why is the correct answer only A? Maybe because in option C, one of the numbers is 129, which is positive, and in two's-complement, 10000001 is 129, but in 8 bits, is 129 representable?

Wait, no. Wait, 10000001 is 128 +1, which is 129, but in two's-complement, 128 is the next negative number. Wait, no. 128 is represented as 10000000, which is -128. So, 10000001 is 129, but in two's-complement, adding 128 and 1 is 129, but since 128 is -128, so 10000001 is -128 +1= -127. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify.

In two's-complement, a positive number is represented with MSB as 0, and a negative number has MSB as 1.

So, 10000000 is -128 (because 128 is the next power of two beyond 7 bits, which is the base for 8-bit numbers).

So, 10000001 is 10000000 + 00000001. So, that is -128 +1 = -127.

Similarly, 10000010 is -126, etc.

So, in option C: 11111111 (255) and 10000001 (-127). So, adding 255 and -127.

255 + (-127) = 128. 128 is beyond 127, so it overflows.

Wait, that's different. So, 255 is 127 +128, and adding -127 would give 128, which is beyond 127, so it overflows.

Wait, so in option C, it's adding 255 and -127, which is 128. 128 is beyond the maximum positive value of 127, so it overflows.

But in option A, adding 255 and 1, which is 256, which is beyond 127, so it overflows.

So, in both cases, the sum is beyond the maximum positive value, hence overflow. So, both A and C cause overflow.

But in the question, it's stated that the correct answer is A. So, perhaps the question is only considering the case where the sum is beyond 127, but it's not considering that adding a positive and a negative number could also cause an overflow.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the case where the individual numbers are within a certain range, but that might not be the case.

Wait, let me check the numbers again.

Option A: 11111111 (255) and 00000001 (1). Both are positive, so their sum is 256, which is beyond 127, so overflow.

Option C: 11111111 (255) and 10000001 (129). So, 255 is positive, and 10000001 is positive because MSB is 1? Wait, no. Wait, 10000001 has MSB as 1, so it's a negative number. So, 10000001 is -127.

So, adding 255 and -127.

255 + (-127) = 128. 128 is beyond 127, so it overflows.

So, both A and C add to a sum beyond 127, causing overflow.

But the question only mentions that the correct answer is A. So, maybe the question is referring to the maximum possible sum that can fit into 8 bits, which is 127. So, any sum beyond that is an overflow. So, both A and C are overflows.

Wait, unless the question is only considering positive numbers, such that when adding two positive numbers, if their sum is beyond 127, it's an overflow.

But in that case, both A and C are overflows.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that when adding two positive numbers, adding 255 and 1 is an overflow, but adding 255 and 129 is not, because 129 is within 127? Wait, no, 129 is beyond 127, but 129 is a positive number in 8 bits.

Wait, but 129 in 8 bits is 10000001, which is 129. But 129 is greater than 127, which is the maximum positive number. So, 129 is also an overflow in itself.

Wait, that's an interesting point. If the individual numbers are beyond the maximum positive value, does that count as overflow? Or is overflow only when the sum exceeds the maximum.

Hmm, in some systems, if a single operand is outside the representable range, it's considered an invalid operation, but in terms of addition, usually, the sum is considered.

Wait, in two's-complement, each number is either positive or negative. So, 10000001 is -127, which is within the range. So, 129 is not a positive number. Wait, 129 is 128 +1, which in two's-complement is -128 +1 = -127.

Therefore, 10000001 is -127. So, in option C, it's adding 255 (which is 127 +128, so 255 is positive but beyond 127, which in 8 bits is not representable as a positive number. So, 255 is actually the maximum value, but 255 is 11111111, which is 255, but in two's-complement, 255 is a positive number, but beyond the maximum 127. Wait, hold on, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in 8 bits, the maximum positive number is 01111111, which is 127. 11111111 is 255, which is beyond that. So, is 255 considered an overflow?

Wait, 255 is 11111111, which is the maximum value in unsigned 8-bit, but in signed two's-complement, 255 is 127 +128, so 255 is actually -128 +128, which is 0. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in two's-complement, the value of 11111111 is -1, not 255. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, 01111111 is 127, and 11111111 is 255 in decimal. So, in two's-complement, the value of 11111111 is -1, because it's all 1s.

Wait, so I was wrong earlier. 11111111 is -1 in two's-complement, not 255.

Wait, this is where I messed up. So, in 8-bit two's-complement, 00000000 is 0, 10000000 is -128, 01111111 is 127, and 11111111 is -1.

Therefore, 11111111 is -1, not 255.

Wait, that's a crucial mistake. So, if 11111111 is -1, then let's recast all numbers.

Option A: 11111111 (-1) and 00000001 (1).

Adding them: -1 + 1 = 0. So, no overflow.

Option B: 00000001 (1) and 10000000 (-128). Adding them: 1 + (-128) = -127. No overflow.

Option C: 11111111 (-1) and 10000001.

Wait, 10000001 in two's-complement is -127, because it's 10000000 (-128) + 00000001 (1), so -128 +1 = -127.

So, adding -1 and -127: -1 + (-127) = -128. Now, -128 is represented as 10000000 in 8 bits. So, the sum is -128, which is exactly the minimum representable value. So, does that cause an overflow?

In two's-complement, adding two numbers and getting the minimum is not an overflow, but rather exactly on the boundary. So, overflow occurs when the sum is outside the range, either beyond 127 or below -128. So, -128 is within the range, so no overflow.

Wait, then, what's going on? If 11111111 is -1, then in option A, adding -1 and 1 gives 0, which is within the range. So, no overflow.

Option C: -1 + (-127) = -128, which is within the range. So, no overflow.

So, this is entirely different from what I thought before because I confused the value of 11111111.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is different.

Wait, let me recast all the numbers correctly.

Number in two's-complement:

Number: 8-bit two's-complement decimal

00000000: 0

00000001: 1

00000010: 2

...

01111111: 127

10000000: -128

10000001: -127

10000010: -126

...

11111111: -1

So, in option A: 11111111 (-1) and 00000001 (1). Sum: 0, which is within the range. No overflow.

Option B: 00000001 (1) and 10000000 (-128). Sum: -127. Within the range. No overflow.

Option C: 11111111 (-1) and 10000001 (-127). Sum: -128. Exactly the minimum. No overflow.

Option D: 10000001 (-127) and 10101010.

Wait, let's convert 10101010.

10101010 is an 8-bit number. Since the MSB is 1, it's negative.

Compute its value:

First, invert the bits: 01010101.

Add 1: 01010110, which is 90.

So, 10101010 is -90.

So, adding -127 and -90: -127 + (-90) = -217.

Wait, -217 is beyond the minimum of -128. So, it's outside the 8-bit two's-complement range, so it overflows.

Wait, so in option D, adding -127 and -90 gives -217, which is less than -128, so it overflows.

Wait, but the question says the correct answer is A. So, perhaps my previous conclusion is wrong.

Wait, so let me recast:

Option A: -1 +1=0. No overflow.

Option B:1 + (-128)=-127. No overflow.

Option C: -1 + (-127)=-128. No overflow.

Option D: -127 + (-90)=-217. Overflow.

But the correct answer is A. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that when adding two positive numbers, if their sum is beyond 127, it overflows, but when adding a positive and negative, you can have different behavior.

But in two's-complement, the sum is determined by the actual arithmetic, so if two positive numbers add beyond 127, it's an overflow, if a positive and negative add beyond 127 or below -128, it's an overflow.

So, in option D: -127 + (-90) = -217, which is below -128, so it overflows.

But the correct answer is A, so maybe the options are different? Wait, let me check the original question again.

The question is: Which of the following pairs of 8-bit, two's-complement numbers will result in overflow when the members of the pairs are added?

Options:

A. 11111111, 00000001

B. 00000001, 10000000

C. 11111111, 10000001

D. 10000001, 10101010

So, according to my corrected analysis:

A: -1 +1=0. No overflow.

B:1 + (-128)=-127. No overflow.

C: -1 + (-127)=-128. No overflow.

D: -127 + (-90)=-217. Overflow.

So, only option D causes overflow.

But the question says the correct answer is A, which contradicts this. So, I must have messed something up.

Wait, perhaps in the question, it was written as 8-bit unsigned numbers? Because 11111111 is often considered as 255 in unsigned 8-bit. So, if the question is about unsigned numbers, then 11111111 is 255, and adding 255 and 1 is 256, which is beyond 255, so overflow.

But in two's-complement signed numbers, 11111111 is -1.

Therefore, if the question is about two's-complement signed numbers, then A does not cause overflow, but D does.

If the question is about unsigned numbers, then A causes overflow.

But the question is about two's-complement numbers, so it's signed.

So, in that case, only D causes overflow.

But since the question states that the correct answer is A, I must have a misunderstanding.

Wait, let me re-express all numbers in two's-complement, considering that 11111111 is -1, 00000001 is 1, etc.

Option A: -1 + 1 = 0. No overflow.

Option B: 1 + (-128) = -127. No overflow.

Option C: -1 + (-127) = -128. No overflow.

Option D: -127 + (-90) = -217. Overflow.

Wait, so only option D causes overflow. So, the correct answer is D?

But the original question says the correct answer is A. So, maybe it's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the addition in unsigned 8-bit numbers. So, in that case, overflow occurs when the sum is beyond 255.

In that case:

Option A: 255 +1=256. Overflow.

Option B:1 +128=129. No overflow.

Option C:255 +129=384. Overflow.

Option D:129 +170=299. Overflow.

So, in unsigned 8-bit, options A, C, D cause overflow. But only option A is given as the correct answer.

But the question is about two's-complement, so perhaps the user made a mistake, or the question is ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about 8-bit addition, so when adding two numbers, if the sum can't be represented in 8 bits, it overflows.

In that case, if we add two numbers, regardless of their sign, and their sum requires more than 8 bits, it overflows.

So, in two's-complement:

Option A: -1 +1=0. No overflow.

Option B:1 + (-128)=-127. No overflow.

Option C:-1 + (-127)=-128. No overflow.

Option D:-127 + (-90)=-217. Which is less than -128. So, in two's-complement, -217 can't be represented in 8 bits; the minimum is -128. So, it overflows.

But again, the correct answer is stated as A, so maybe the question is about something else.

Wait, another thought. Maybe in two's-complement addition, adding 11111111 and 00000001 is considered an overflow because 11111111 is the minimum number (-1) and adding 1 causes it to wrap around, but in reality, -1 +1=0, which does not cause an overflow. It's a normal addition.

Alternatively, maybe when adding in two's-complement, if you have a carryout beyond the 8th bit, it's considered an overflow.

So, in option A: adding -1 and 1.

-1 +1=0. No carryover, so no overflow.

In option C: adding -1 and -127: total is -128, which is 10000000. So, adding in two's-complement:

-1: 11111111

-127: 10000001

Adding them:

Start from right:

1 +1=0, carryover1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1 +0 +1=0,carry1

1 +0 +1
