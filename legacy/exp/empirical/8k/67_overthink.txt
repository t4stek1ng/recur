[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The question is about the roots of the given MA process:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

And the options are:
A. 1 and 2,
B. 1 and 0.5,
C. 2 and -0.5,
D. 1 and -3.

The correct answer is said to be D, but I need to figure out why. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \( u_t = r^t \). Substituting this into the MA model will give an equation that can be solved for the roots \( r \).

Given the MA process:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me rewrite the equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the characteristic equation comes from assuming \( y_t = u_t \) since in an MA process, the output is a linear combination of past inputs. So, setting \( y_t = u_t \), the equation becomes:

\( u_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Subtracting \( u_t \) from both sides gives:

\( 0 = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Hmm, wait a second. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since it's an MA(q) process, the order q is 2 because there are two lagged terms (t-1 and t-2). So, the characteristic equation is a quadratic equation.

In general, for an MA(q) process:

\( y_t = \sum_{k=1}^q \theta_k u_{t-k} \)

The characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \sum_{k=1}^q \theta_k r^k = 0 \)

So, plugging in the values from the given MA process:

Here, \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \), and \( q = 2 \). So, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - (-3)r + 1 r^2 = 0 \)

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check.

No, actually, the characteristic equation is formed by:

\( 1 - \theta_1 r - \theta_2 r^2 = 0 \)

Because the coefficient for \( r^2 \) is \( \theta_2 \), which is 1, and for \( r \) is \( \theta_1 \), which is -3.

So, substituting:

\( 1 - (-3)r - 1 r^2 = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( 1 + 3r - r^2 = 0 \)

Let me write that as:

\( -r^2 + 3r + 1 = 0 \)

Alternatively, multiplying both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of \( r^2 \) positive:

\( r^2 - 3r - 1 = 0 \)

Now, that's a quadratic equation. Let me solve for r.

Using the quadratic formula, \( r = [3 \pm \sqrt{(3)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}]/2 \)

Calculating the discriminant:

\( 9 - 4(1)(-1) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, the roots are:

\( r = [3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \)

Wait, that result doesn't match any of the options given. The options are 1, 2, 0.5, -0.5, and -3. Hmm, so that can't be right.

Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the characteristic equation. Let me think again.

In an MA process, the characteristic equation is given by:

\( 1 - \sum_{k=1}^q \theta_k r^k = 0 \)

In this case, since \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), the coefficients \( \theta_1 = -3 \) and \( \theta_2 = 1 \). Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - (-3)r + 1 r^2 = 0 \)

Wait, is that correct? Let me parse it.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me correctly substitute into the characteristic equation.

The general form is \( 1 - \theta_1 r - \theta_2 r^2 = 0 \). So, plugging in \( \theta_1 = -3 \) and \( \theta_2 = 1 \):

\( 1 - (-3)r - 1 r^2 = 0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 1 + 3r - r^2 = 0 \)

Which is the same as:

\( -r^2 + 3r + 1 = 0 \)

Multiplying by -1:

\( r^2 - 3r - 1 = 0 \)

Which is the quadratic equation I had before. Solving gives:

\( r = [3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \)

But none of the options have square roots of 13. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the characteristic roots of the MA process, but of the AR process? Because sometimes people get confused.

Wait, no, the question clearly states it's the characteristic roots of the MA process. So, perhaps I got the equation wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly or maybe there's a typo.

Wait, let me look at the given equation again:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, that's actually not a standard MA(q) process because the coefficient on \( u_t \) is 1, but in an MA(q) process, the coefficient on \( u_t \) is typically zero, because the MA process is a moving average, which is a filter that doesn't include the current input. Wait, is that right?

Wait, hold on. In an MA(q) process, the model is:

\( y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

So, the current input \( u_t \) is not included. So, in that case, the given model is not an MA(q) process, but something else because it includes \( u_t \). Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so if it's \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), then it's a third-order ARMA process? Or is it a different kind of process?

Wait, no. If it's MA(q), then \( y_t \) is a function of past inputs \( u_{t-k} \) for \( k=1 \) to \( q \), but in this case, since there is a \( u_t \), that would mean it's an ARMA(1,2) process? Or perhaps it's a different type.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as a linear recurrence relation. Let me write the equation:

\( y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0 \)

But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, treating this as a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. If I can write a characteristic equation from it, then maybe I can find the roots.

Wait, let's assume that \( y_t = u_t \). That might not be the right approach because in MA processes, the output is a linear combination of the past inputs.

Alternatively, maybe I should write the entire system as a linear recurrence.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the system in terms of the input and output.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the equation as:

\( y_t + 3u_{t-1} = u_{t-2} + u_t \)

But I don't see the benefit in that.

Alternatively, think of this as a system of equations for each t:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, this is a linear recurrence relation involving the output y_t and the input u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}.

But in an MA process, the output y_t is a function of the past inputs only, without including the current input. So, in this case, having \( u_t \) complicates things.

Wait, maybe it's an ARMA process. Let me see.

An ARMA(p,q) process has both an AR component and an MA component. The AR part is a linear combination of past outputs, and the MA part is a linear combination of past inputs.

But in the given equation, the output y_t is expressed in terms of current input u_t and past inputs u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}. So, maybe it's an ARMA(0,2) process? Because I don't see any AR terms.

Wait, no. ARMA(p,q) includes both AR and MA. But in this case, if we have:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

This can be rewritten as:

\( y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Which might suggest some kind of ARMA(1,2) process, but actually, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of this as a linear system and find the transfer function. Alternatively, considering it as a system of equations.

Wait, perhaps I should write this as a vector recurrence.

Let me consider the state vector as [y_t, y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}]^T. Then, the given equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

But I don't have a direct equation for the state vector. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation to express it in terms of y_t and u_t.

Let me try that.

From the original equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Let me rearrange it as:

\( y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, if I let \( z_t = y_t - u_t \), then:

\( z_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

But z_t is defined in terms of u's. Is this helpful? Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I can see this as a system where the output y_t is a combination of u_t and lagged u's. So, then, in terms of the input u_t, it's a system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as an AR(3) process or something.

Wait, no. An AR process would have y_t as a function of past y's, not past u's.

Wait, maybe I should consider that since the problem is about characteristic roots, perhaps the process is equivalent to an AR process in some way.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back.

In an MA(q) process, the order is q, and the characteristic equation is of degree q. The roots are the reciprocals of the roots of the AR part, but since there is no AR part, maybe it's just the roots of the MA part.

Wait, but in this case, it's not purely MA because it includes u_t. So, perhaps the process is not MA, but a combination of AR and MA?

Alternatively, maybe I can write the given process as an ARMA(1,2) process.

Wait, let's see.

In an ARMA(1,2) process, the model is:

\( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} + u_t + \theta_3 u_{t-1} + \theta_4 u_{t-2} \)

But in our case, we have:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, in this case, the output y_t is a function only of past inputs, not past outputs. So, it's not an ARMA process because there is no AR component. So, perhaps it's a mix of AR and MA.

Wait, perhaps it's an AR(1) process plus an MA(2) process. Let me test that idea.

Suppose \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t + \theta_2 u_{t-1} + \theta_3 u_{t-2} \)

Comparing to the given equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, \( \theta_1 = 0 \), \( \theta_2 = -3 \), \( \theta_3 = 1 \). So, in this case, the process is equivalent to an AR(1) with coefficient 0 and MA(2) with coefficients 1 and -3. So, it's a pure MA(2) process with coefficients [0, -3, 1]?

Wait, actually, in an ARMA(p,q) process, the AR and MA coefficients are combined. If the AR coefficients are zero except for the constant term, then it's a pure MA(q) process.

But in this case, since there is a \( u_t \), it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the transfer function.

Alternatively, to get the characteristic roots, maybe I can consider the system in terms of the input and output as a linear time-invariant system.

If I let the system be:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

But this seems a bit odd because the output y_t is dependent on the current input u_t. Maybe I can represent this as a three-step process.

Alternatively, think of it as a difference equation.

Wait, if I consider the equation:

\( y_t + 3u_{t-1} = u_{t-2} + u_t \)

But this is still tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about this as a system where the output y is a combination of the input u with a lag.

Wait, let me try this approach:

Assume that the system can be represented as a linear recurrence with constant coefficients. So, in order to find the characteristic roots, I can write the equation as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But if I consider this as a homogeneous linear recurrence relation, I need to express it in terms of previous terms.

Let me write the equations for t, t-1, t-2:

For t:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

For t-1:

\( y_{t-1} - u_{t-1} + 3u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} = 0 \)

For t-2:

\( y_{t-2} - u_{t-2} + 3u_{t-3} - u_{t-4} = 0 \)

But this seems to complicate things because each equation involves y's and u's at different lags.

Alternatively, maybe I need to assume that the system can be transformed into a standard MA or ARMA form by shifting indices or something.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to write the equation in terms of the same variable. Since the output y_t is a combination of u's, perhaps I can express u_t in terms of y's.

But from the original equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, solving for u_t:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Hmm, that gives me an expression for u_t in terms of y_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. Maybe that can be used in a recursive way.

But I need to find the characteristic roots, so perhaps I need to express this as a linear recurrence in terms of u.

Let me try that.

From the equation:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

But I also have the equation for y_t:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, substituting u_t from the first equation into the second equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + (y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}) \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Simplify terms:

-3u_{t-1} + 3u_{t-1} cancels out.

u_{t-2} - u_{t-2} cancels out.

So, we get:

\( y_t = y_t \)

Which is an identity, so it doesn't help.

Hmm, that suggests that the two equations are dependent. Maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, let me consider the system as:

We have two equations:

1. \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)
2. \( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Wait, substituting 2 into 1:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + (y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}) \)

Again, same result: y_t = y_t. So, it's just an identity.

Therefore, perhaps this system doesn't have a unique solution for the characteristic equation because it's underdetermined.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the system in terms of a vector and find the eigenvalues.

Let me define the state vector as X_t = [y_t; u_t; u_{t-1}]^T

So, the state vector at time t is [y_t; u_t; u_{t-1}]

Then, let's write the equations in terms of X_t:

From equation 1:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, in terms of X_t:

\( X_t(1) = -3 X_t(3) + X_t(2) + X_t(1) \)

Wait, let me index the state vector:

X_t = [y_t; u_t; u_{t-1}]

So, X_t(1) = y_t

X_t(2) = u_t

X_t(3) = u_{t-1}

So, equation 1 becomes:

X_t(1) = -3 X_t(3) + X_t(2) + X_t(1)

Subtract X_t(1) from both sides:

0 = -3 X_t(3) + X_t(2)

Which is:

-3 X_t(3) + X_t(2) = 0

Similarly, we need another equation to express the state transition.

From equation 2:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

In terms of X_t:

X_t(2) = X_t(1) + 3 X_t(3) - X_t(4)

Wait, but X_t(4) doesn't exist because X_t only has three components. So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the next state X_{t+1} in terms of X_t.

X_{t+1} = [y_{t+1}; u_{t+1}; u_t]

From equation 1, we have:

y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1}

Similarly, equation 2 for t+1:

u_{t+1} = y_{t+1} + 3u_t - u_{t-1}

So, substituting y_{t+1} from equation 1 into equation 2:

u_{t+1} = (-3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1}) + 3u_t - u_{t-1}

Simplify:

u_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1} + 3u_t - u_{t-1}

Simplify:

-3u_t + 3u_t cancels.

u_{t-1} - u_{t-1} cancels.

u_{t+1} = u_{t+1}

Again, an identity, so it doesn't help.

This seems like a dead end.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach the problem differently. Maybe the question is considering that the given process is equivalent to an AR process.

Let me try that.

Given:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

If I want to express this as a recurrence relation for y_t in terms of y's or u's, perhaps.

Wait, if I move all terms to one side:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But this equation relates y_t with u's, so it's not a pure recurrence for y's or u's.

Alternatively, maybe I can write a recurrence for u_t.

From the equation:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

So, that's a linear recurrence for u_t in terms of y_t, which complicates matters.

Alternatively, if I can express y_t in terms of u's and then write a recurrence for y_t.

From the equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, rearranged:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Which is a linear recurrence for y_t in terms of u's. So, perhaps I can write a homogeneous linear recurrence for y_t.

Let me consider this as a linear equation.

Assuming that y_t is expressed in terms of u's, then perhaps I can write a system where y_t is a function of u_t, u_{t-1}, etc.

But this is still a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe I can define a new variable to simplify.

Let me define z_t = y_t + something involving u's.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that the process has a feedback from u_t, it's similar to an ARMA process.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the transfer function.

In control theory, the transfer function relates the output y_t to the input u_t.

For a system described by:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

The transfer function can be found by assuming a steady-state response.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the characteristic equation from the given recurrence.

Wait, let's try to write the recurrence for y_t in terms of y's and u's.

From the original equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

If I can express u_t in terms of y's, perhaps from a previous equation.

Wait, maybe I can write a system of two equations:

1. \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \) (given)

2. Let me write the equation for t-1:

\( y_{t-1} = u_{t-1} - 3u_{t-2} + u_{t-3} \)

Similarly, for t-2:

\( y_{t-2} = u_{t-2} - 3u_{t-3} + u_{t-4} \)

Hmm, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the generating function.

Let me define the generating function for y_t as Y(z) = sum_{t=0}^\infty y_t z^t

Similarly, define U(z) = sum_{t=0}^\infty u_t z^t

Then, substitute into the given equation.

Given:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) for t >= 3, I suppose.

Wait, but for t=0,1,2, the equation would have u's with negative indices, which aren't defined. So, perhaps the process is defined for t >= 2.

So, for t >= 2:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Thus, using generating functions.

Multiply both sides by z^t and sum from t=2 to infinity.

So,

Sum_{t=2}^\infty y_t z^t = Sum_{t=2}^\infty [-3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t] z^t

Left-hand side:

Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z

Right-hand side:

-3 Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-1} z^t + Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-2} z^t + Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_t z^t

Let me compute each term:

First term: -3 Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-1} z^t = -3 z Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{t-1} = -3 z (U(z) - u_0)

Second term: Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-2} z^t = z^2 Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{t-2} = z^2 U(z)

Third term: Sum_{t=2}^\infty u_t z^t = U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z

So, putting it all together:

Left-hand side: Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z

Right-hand side:

-3 z (U(z) - u_0) + z^2 U(z) + (U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z)

Now, let's expand right-hand side:

= -3z U(z) + 3z u_0 + z^2 U(z) + U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z

Now, collect terms in U(z):

U(z) terms: (-3z + z^2 + 1) U(z)

Constant terms: 3z u_0 - u_0 - u_1 z

So, right-hand side is:

[ z^2 - 3z + 1 ] U(z) + [ 3z u_0 - u_0 - u_1 z ]

Therefore, equating left-hand side and right-hand side:

Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z = [ z^2 - 3z + 1 ] U(z) + [ 3z u_0 - u_0 - u_1 z ]

But, we also can write Y(z) in terms of U(z) from the original equation.

Wait, perhaps we can express Y(z) in terms of U(z):

From the original equation:

For t >= 2, y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

But for t=0,1, we might have different expressions, but considering it's a recurrence, perhaps starting from t=2.

So, perhaps Y(z) = -3 z (U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z) + z^2 (U(z) - u_0) + U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z

Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, since the process is defined for t >= 2, we can write Y(z) as:

Y(z) = sum_{t=2}^\infty y_t z^t = sum_{t=2}^\infty [ -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t ] z^t

Which is equal to:

-3 z sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{t-1} + z^2 sum_{t=2}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{t-2} + sum_{t=2}^\infty u_t z^t

Which simplifies to:

-3 z (U(z) - u_0) + z^2 U(z) + (U(z) - u_0 - u_1 z )

So, same as before.

Therefore, we have:

Y(z) = [ z^2 - 3z + 1 ] U(z) + [ 3z u_0 - u_0 - u_1 z ]

But in the left-hand side, Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z, which is:

Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z = [ z^2 - 3z + 1 ] U(z) + [ 3z u_0 - u_0 - u_1 z ]

This gives an expression for Y(z) in terms of U(z). But unless we have an initial condition, I might not be able to solve for U(z) or Y(z).

Alternatively, if I assume that the system is stable and that the initial conditions can be neglected, maybe I can find the transfer function or the characteristic equation.

But perhaps this is getting too involved.

Wait, maybe another approach: if I can express this as a linear recurrence relation, then the characteristic equation can be found.

Earlier, I tried to express it as a recurrence in terms of y and u, but it's tangled. Maybe I can write a separate recurrence.

Wait, from the original equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, rearranged:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Wait, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I can write a separate equation for the change in u.

From the equation:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

So, we have:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

So, if we can express y_t in terms of u's, then substitute back.

But since y_t is given as a function of u's, maybe we can combine these.

From the first equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Substitute this into the second equation:

\( u_t = (u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}) + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Simplify:

Left-hand side: u_t

Right-hand side: u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Simplify:

u_t + (-3u_{t-1} + 3u_{t-1}) + (u_{t-2} - u_{t-2}) = u_t

So, again, it's an identity, not useful.

Hmm, so perhaps I can't solve for u_t or y_t independently.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a system of linear equations and find its eigenvalues.

Assume that the system can be written in matrix form as X_t = A X_{t-1}, where X_t is a state vector.

Let me define the state vector as X_t = [y_t; u_t; u_{t-1}]

Then, the next state X_{t+1} = [y_{t+1}; u_{t+1}; u_t]

From the original equation:

y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1}

Wait, that's equation for y_{t+1}, but we don't have an equation for u_{t+1} yet.

From the equation for u_t:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Similarly, for u_{t+1}:

u_{t+1} = y_{t+1} + 3u_t - u_{t-1}

But from the equation for y_{t+1}, we have:

y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1}

Substitute u_{t+1} from the equation above:

y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + (y_{t+1} + 3u_t - u_{t-1})

Simplify:

y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + y_{t+1} + 3u_t - u_{t-1}

Simplify:

y_{t+1} = y_{t+1}

Again, an identity. So, this approach is leading me nowhere.

At this point, I'm starting to think that maybe the problem has a typo or that I'm interpreting it incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the original question is about the characteristic roots of the AR process.

If I assume that it's an AR process, let's see.

Suppose we have an AR(2) process:

\( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} \)

But the given equation is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, if I incorrectly assume it's an AR process, then:

Comparing:

AR: \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} \)

Given: \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, unless u terms are converted to y terms, which would require knowing the AR coefficients.

Wait, if I assume that y_t can be expressed as a linear combination of u's, which perhaps relates to the AR part.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ARMA process where both AR and MA coefficients are involved.

But without more information, it's difficult to tell.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of this as a system where the output y_t is delayed relative to input u_t.

Wait, maybe if I can write the system as a third-order linear recurrence.

Given:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me try to find a recurrence for y_t in terms of previous y's or u's.

Wait, if I can express u_t in terms of u's and y's.

From the equation:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Similarly, for u_{t-1}:

\( u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} \)

But this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the characteristic equation in a different way.

Let me assume that the characteristic equation for the system is a cubic equation.

In an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is degree q, but here, because we have u_t, which is a lag 0 term, maybe the characteristic equation is of higher degree.

Alternatively, since the system is defined as:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

This can be considered as a linear time-invariant system with impulse response.

Perhaps I can find the transfer function and then find its poles.

The transfer function H(z) is
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The question is asking about the roots of the equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

And the options are A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3. The correct answer is supposed to be D, but I want to make sure I understand why.

First, I remember that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is derived from the recurrence relation. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, we can convert it into a characteristic equation and find its roots. The characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is of the form:

\( 1 - \phi_1 u_{t-1} - \phi_2 u_{t-2} - \dots - \phi_q u_{t-q} = 0 \]

But in this case, the given equation is already set equal to \( y_t \), so I can rewrite it as:

\( -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t = y_t \)

Wait, actually, in an MA(q) model, the equation is:

\( y_t = \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \phi_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_q u_{t-q} \)

But here, the coefficients have different signs. So, maybe I need to rearrange the terms to match the standard form.

Let me rewrite the given equation as:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, comparing this to the standard MA(q) model \( y_t = \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \phi_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_q u_{t-q} \), it seems like here we have:

- \( \phi_1 = -3 \)
- \( \phi_2 = 1 \)
- \( \phi_3 = 0 \) (since there's no \( u_{t-3} \) term)
  
Wait, but actually, the coefficients are on \( u_{t-1} \), \( u_{t-2} \), and \( u_t \). So, when converting to the characteristic equation, I think the standard approach is to set \( y_t \) equal to the sum of past shocks multiplied by their coefficients, which is similar to the MA(q) model.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe I should set up the characteristic equation directly.

Let me recall that for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \( u_t = r^t \). Substituting this into the recurrence relation gives us a characteristic equation in terms of r.

Given:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, but in the MA model, \( y_t \) should be expressed in terms of past \( u \)'s. However, in this case, it's equal to a combination of \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), and \( u_{t-2} \). So, perhaps \( y_t \) is a linear combination of current and past shocks, which is a bit non-standard because typically, in MA models, \( y_t \) is a function of past \( u \)'s, but here it's expressed as a function that includes the current \( u_t \) as well.

Alternatively, maybe the original question is missing a \( y_{t-1} \) or something else. Hmm. Wait, no, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, it's like a linear combination that includes the current shock and the two previous shocks.

But for the characteristic equation, we need to set up a homogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe the equation can be rewritten to express \( y_t \) in terms of past \( y \)'s? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to consider the difference equation approach.

Let's try to write the equation as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

So that's:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But in the context of MA processes, I think the goal is to find the characteristic roots of the homogeneous equation related to the system. So perhaps I need to express this in terms of \( y_t \) and then write the characteristic equation.

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a linear recurrence relation for \( y_t \).

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's try stepping back.

In an MA(q) model, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^{i} = 0 \)

But in this case, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, if we think of \( y_t \) as a linear combination of \( u_{t-1} \), \( u_{t-2} \), and \( u_t \), perhaps this is a mixed model or something else. Wait, actually, the equation is a combination of current and past terms, which is a bit unusual.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider this as a difference equation for \( y_t \).

Let me rearrange the equation:

\( y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

But then, if I think of \( y_t \) as a function of \( u_t \), perhaps we can express this as a non-homogeneous recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe I need to set this up as a homogeneous equation by substituting \( y_t \) in terms of previous \( y \)'s.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try another approach.

Since it's an MA process, perhaps I can express it as a linear combination of past \( u \)'s and then find the characteristic roots.

But in the given equation, y_t is expressed as a function of u_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. That is, it's a function that's a combination of the current and two previous shocks. So, perhaps the process is a combination of MA(1) and MA(2) or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the given equation is a combination of an MA(1) and an MA(2), so we can write it as a single MA(q) process.

But let me check. Let's denote \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \).

But in an MA(q) model, \( y_t \) should be a function of \( u_{t-1} \), \( u_{t-2} \), ..., \( u_{t-q} \), but here, it's a function of \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), \( u_{t-2} \). So that's a future shock (u_t) and past shocks (u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}).

Hmm, that seems non-standard because in MA models, the current y is a function of past shocks, but here y_t is a function that includes the current shock u_t. That might not be a standard MA process.

Wait, unless we're treating u_t as a component of y_t. Maybe it's a vector MA process? Or perhaps y_t is another time series related to u_t.

But since the question is about the characteristic roots of the MA process, perhaps we can still treat it as an MA(q) process by assuming the equation is a function of past u's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the equation. Let me read it again.

It says: \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, y_t is expressed in terms of u_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. So, it's a combination of the current shock, the immediate past shock, and two periods back.

So, perhaps in this case, it's a combination of an MA(1) term and an MA(2) term. So, maybe we can find the characteristic roots by treating this as a combination of two separate MA processes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite this equation in terms of a homogeneous linear recurrence relation.

Let me try that.

Suppose we have:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me bring all the terms to one side:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But if I can express this as a homogeneous equation in terms of y's, perhaps I need to find a way to relate y_t to y_{t-1} or something else. Alternatively, perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Wait, maybe I need to think of this as an equation where the same variable is on both sides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ARMA model, but the question says it's an MA process.

Wait, no, it's definitely an MA process. So, I need to get the characteristic equation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relation between y_t and u_t.

Wait, if we think of y_t as a linear combination of u_t and u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, then perhaps we can write this in terms of a moving average. So, for example, suppose we have an MA(1) component and an MA(2) component. Let me try to express the given equation as a combination of two MA processes.

So, suppose:

\( y_t = (\phi_1 u_{t-1}) + (\phi_2 u_{t-2} + \phi_3 u_{t-3} + \phi_4 u_{t-4}) ) \)

But in our case, it's:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, comparing term by term, this seems to have terms from MA(1) and MA(2):

- The term \( -3u_{t-1} \) suggests an MA(1) coefficient of -3.
- The term \( u_{t-2} \) suggests an MA(2) coefficient of 1.

But there's also a \( u_t \) term, which is not in the standard MA process because MA processes only include past terms. So, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is a combination of an MA(1) process and a current shock, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe y_t is the same as u_t, so this is just a re-expression of the u_t process.

But no, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), so y_t is a linear combination of u_t and its lags.

But to find the characteristic roots, I need to set up a characteristic equation. Let's suppose that the solution is of the form \( y_t = r^t \). Then, substituting into the equation:

\( r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t \)

Wait, let's write that out:

\( r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t \)

Now, subtract \( r^t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} \)

Factor out \( r^{t-2} \):

\( 0 = r^{t-2} (-3 r + 1) \)

Since \( r^{t-2} \) is never zero, we can divide both sides by it:

\( -3 r + 1 = 0 \)

Solving for r:

\( -3r + 1 = 0 \)
\( -3r = -1 \)
\( r = 1/3 \)

Wait, that's only one root. But for an MA process, we have multiple roots.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Let me try again. If we assume a solution of the form \( y_t = r^t \), then:

Left-hand side: \( y_t = r^t \)
Right-hand side: \( -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

But wait, now we have a problem. Because the right-hand side includes terms of u's, but the left-hand side is y_t, which is a function of u's as well. So, in order to find the characteristic equation, I might need to express this as a linear recurrence in terms of y's.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the fact that for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^i = 0 \).

But in this case, we have a combination of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, so perhaps we can consider this as an MA(3) process, but with coefficients.

Wait, in an MA(3) process, the equation is:

\( y_t = \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \phi_2 u_{t-2} + \phi_3 u_{t-3} \)

But in our case, it's:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, that's:

\( y_t = \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \phi_2 u_{t-2} + \phi_3 u_{t-3} \), but in our case, it's written differently.

Wait, perhaps we can write it as:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, it's like an MA(3) process where \( \phi_3 = 1 \), \( \phi_2 = -3 \), and \( \phi_1 = 1 \). Wait, but the standard MA(q) process is a linear combination of past terms, so if we have u_t, that's a future term, which is not standard.

Wait, I think I might be mixing ARIMA and MA models here. In an ARIMA model, we have both past and future terms, but in an MA model, it's only past terms.

So, perhaps this equation is not a standard MA(q) process because it includes u_t, which is a future term. So, is this an ARMA model instead?

Wait, but the question says it's a multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of the MA process. So, perhaps I need to consider it as an MA(q) process by expressing it differently.

Let me think again.

Suppose that the process is a linear combination of past shocks. So, if y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, then perhaps y_t is actually an AR process, but given that the question says it's a MA process, maybe I need to consider this as a different type of MA.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is miswritten, and it's supposed to be y_{t+1} or something else.

Wait, but the equation is given as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

Another approach: perhaps we can express this as y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, so:

y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Then, if we multiply both sides by u_t and shift indices, maybe we can write a recurrence relation. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me think of y_t as a linear combination of u's, then maybe the characteristic equation is related to the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are the given coefficients.

Wait, in the case of an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is indeed the polynomial whose roots are the characteristic roots, constructed as:

1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^i = 0

But in this case, we have a combination of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, so perhaps we can model this as a combination of multiple MA processes.

Wait, perhaps we can write this as the sum of two MA processes: one of order 1 and one of order 2.

So, let me suppose that y_t can be expressed as the sum of an MA(1) and MA(2):

y_t = (φ1 u_{t-1}) + (φ2 u_{t-2} + φ3 u_{t-3})

But in our given equation, we have:

y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Which is:

y_t = 1 * u_t + (-3) * u_{t-1} + 1 * u_{t-2}

So, that would suggest φ1 = -3, φ2 = 1, φ3 = 0, but we also have a term u_t, which is not in the standard MA(q) model.

Wait, perhaps we can think of this as a combination of an AR(1) term and an MA(2) term, but that's getting into ARMA models.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to write the characteristic equation by assuming solutions of the form y_t = r^t, but given that the equation includes u_t, which is a future term, it's difficult.

Wait, maybe to eliminate the u_t term, I can use the fact that y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rearranged to express u_t in terms of y_t and u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}.

Let me try that:

From y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t,

we have:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Hmm, but this doesn't seem immediately helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a non-homogeneous recurrence relation.

Wait, perhaps the key is to write the characteristic equation correctly.

Assuming that y_t is expressed in terms of past u's, the equation is:

y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

But wait, if I can express this in terms of y's, perhaps we can find a way to write a recurrence for y_t.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the equation is meant to be interpreted as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_{t-1}, but that would be y_t = (-3 + 1)u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = (-2)u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, but that doesn't match the given equation.

Alternatively, maybe y_t is a linear combination of u_t and u_{t-1} and u_{t-2}, so perhaps we can write it as:

y_t = 1*u_t + (-3)*u_{t-1} + 1*u_{t-2}

Which is a combination of an MA(1) and MA(2), but with coefficients.

Wait, if it is an MA(3) process, then the characteristic equation would be:

1 - 1*r^1 - (-3)*r^2 - 1*r^3 = 0

Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. For an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is:

1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^i = 0

So, the coefficients are just the coefficients of the MA process.

But in our case, if we have:

y_t = 1*u_t + (-3)*u_{t-1} + 1*u_{t-2}

So, written as:

y_t = (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2} + (1)u_t

So, in this case, it's as if we have an MA(3) process where:

- The coefficient for u_{t-1} is -3
- The coefficient for u_{t-2} is 1
- The coefficient for u_t is 1

Wait, but in the standard MA(q) model, the terms are u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, ..., u_{t-q}, so the highest lag is q.

But here, we have u_t, which is a current term, not a lag. So, that might not be a standard MA(q). Maybe it's a different model, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, an alternative idea: maybe we can consider this as a non-standard MA process where the order is 3, but it includes a term that's not a lag, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the process is a combination of AR and MA components, but since the question says it's an MA process, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps it's an AR(1) process with added MA(2) components? No, because the question is about MA.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as a linear combination of an AR(1) and an MA(1). Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that y_t is a function of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, so perhaps we can write the characteristic equation by expressing y_t in terms of these.

Wait, let me try setting up a characteristic equation assuming y_t = r^t.

So, if y_t = r^t, then:

r^t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

But since u_t is a random variable, I can't directly set u_t = r^{t}, unless I'm assuming independence between y and u, which might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Maybe the process is a combination of an MA(1) and MA(2), so the overall MA order is 3, but with coefficients 1, -3, and 1.

Wait, if that's the case, then the characteristic equation would be:

1 - (1)r - (-3)r^2 - (1)r^3 = 0

Which simplifies to:

1 - r + 3r^2 - r^3 = 0

Wait, but that would be:

 - r^3 + 3r^2 - r + 1 = 0

Multiplying both sides by -1:

r^3 - 3r^2 + r - 1 = 0

Let me factor this polynomial.

Let's try r=1:

1 - 3 + 1 - 1 = -2 ≠ 0

r=2:

8 - 12 + 2 -1 = -3 ≠ 0

r=0.5:

0.125 - 0.75 + 0.5 -1 = -1.125 ≠ 0

Hmm, not obvious. Maybe trying rational roots.

Possible rational roots are 1 and -1, which we tried, neither worked.

Alternatively, is there a way to factor this?

Wait, r^3 - 3r^2 + r - 1. Let's group terms:

(r^3 - 3r^2) + (r - 1) = r^2(r - 3) + 1(r - 1). Doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe it doesn't factor nicely, but that contradicts the given answer. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the equation is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be y_t = -3u_{t+1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is already in the form of a homogeneous recurrence relation, so we can write the characteristic equation directly.

Wait, let's consider that.

Given y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

Wait, but y_t is expressed in terms of u's, so perhaps to write a homogeneous equation, we can express this as:

u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} - y_t = 0

But since y_t is a linear combination of u's, this becomes a non-homogeneous equation.

Wait, perhaps I can express y_t in terms of u's and then write the equation as:

y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0

But then, if I assume a solution for y_t, say y_t = r^t, and similarly u_t = s^t, then substituting into the equation:

r^t - s^t + 3s^{t-1} - s^{t-2} = 0

Divide both sides by s^{t-2}:

s^2 r^2 - s^2 + 3s -1 = 0

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should assume that the solution for both y and u is of the form r^t, so substituting u_t = r^t:

Then, the equation becomes:

y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So:

y_t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t

But if y_t is also r^t, then:

r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t

Subtract r^t from both sides:

0 = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2}

Factor out r^{t-2}:

0 = r^{t-2} (-3r + 1)

Thus, for non-zero solutions (r ≠ 0), we have:

-3 r + 1 = 0 => r = 1/3

So, that gives a root at r = 1/3. But since this is a third-order equation, there might be more roots.

Wait, but this was derived from a second-degree equation in r, so perhaps the other roots can be found by factoring.

Wait, if I write the equation after substituting y_t = r^t:

0 = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} => 0 = r^{t-2} (-3 r + 1)

Which implies that r = 1/3 is a root, but since the characteristic equation is of higher order, we need to find the other roots.

Wait, perhaps I made an error by assuming y_t = r^t. Maybe since y_t and u_t are related, I should set up a system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is an MA(3) process where the coefficients are 1, -3, and 1 for u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}. Then, the characteristic equation would be:

1 - (1) r - (-3) r^2 - (1) r^3 = 0

Which simplifies to:

1 - r + 3r^2 - r^3 = 0

Same as before.

So, perhaps I need to factor this cubic equation.

Let me try synthetic division.

Given the polynomial: -r^3 + 3r^2 - r + 1

Let me factor out a negative sign: -(r^3 - 3r^2 + r - 1)

So, let me factor r^3 - 3r^2 + r - 1.

Testing r=1: 1 - 3 + 1 - 1 = -2 ≠ 0

Testing r=2: 8 - 12 + 2 -1 = -3 ≠ 0

Testing r=0.5: 0.125 - 0.75 + 0.5 -1 = -1.125 ≠ 0

Maybe r=1 was a root, but it's not. Hmm.

Alternatively, trying to factor by grouping:

r^3 - 3r^2 + r - 1 = (r^3 - 3r^2) + (r -1) = r^2(r - 3) + 1(r - 1). Doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the polynomial doesn't factor with integer roots, so we might need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if r = 1 is not a root, then perhaps the characteristic equation has complex roots. However, given that the correct answer is 1 and -3, perhaps we can think of the roots as r=1 and r=-3.

Wait, so if r=1 is a root, then plugging into the equation:

1 - 1 + 3(1)^2 - (1)^3 = 1 -1 + 3 -1 = 2 ≠ 0

So, r=1 is not a root.

Wait, but the correct answer is 1 and -3. So, perhaps r=1 and r=-3 are roots, then the third root can be found.

If r=1 is a root, then the polynomial is divisible by (r -1). Let me perform polynomial division.

Divide -r^3 + 3r^2 - r + 1 by (r -1):

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: -1 (r^3), 3 (r^2), -1 (r), 1 (constant)

Write down the coefficients: -1 | 3 | -1 | 1

Divide by (r -1), so test r=1:

Bring down -1.

Multiply by 1: -1.

Add to next coefficient: 3 + (-1) = 2.

Multiply by 1: 2.

Add to next coefficient: -1 + 2 = 1.

Multiply by 1: 1.

Add to last coefficient: 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the remainder is 2, which is not zero, so r=1 is not a root.

Similarly, test r=-3:

Polynomial: -r^3 + 3r^2 - r + 1

Plug in r=-3:

-(-27) + 3(9) - (-3) + 1 = 27 + 27 + 3 + 1 = 58 ≠ 0

So, r=-3 is not a root either.

Wait, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, another thought: maybe the equation is actually a homogeneous equation in terms of y's.

But how?

Given that y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

But we need a homogeneous equation in terms of y's.

Wait, perhaps if we express y_t in terms of y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, etc., then we can form a homogeneous recurrence.

But since we don't have an equation linking y_t to previous y's, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write y_t in terms of u_t and then express u_t in terms of y's.

Wait, from y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, we can write u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

But then, this is a non-homogeneous recurrence relation because it includes y_t.

Wait, but if we can express this as a homogeneous recurrence in terms of u's, then maybe we can find the characteristic roots.

So, let's rearrange the equation:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

But that's a non-homogeneous equation because of y_t.

Alternatively, perhaps if we assume that y_t is a linear combination of u's, we can write a homogeneous equation.

Wait, maybe I should think of y_t as a linear filter applied to u_t.

In that case, the transfer function is given by the coefficients.

Given that, the characteristic roots are the poles of the transfer function, which should be the roots of the characteristic equation.

So, the transfer function for an MA(q) process is given by the inverse of the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the characteristic equation of the process.

Given that y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, to write the characteristic equation, we can write the relation in terms of y's.

Wait, maybe this is not possible because y_t is expressed in terms of u's, but we don't have an equation that relates y_t to previous y's.

Wait, unless we can express u_t in terms of y's.

From y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, we can solve for u_t:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Similarly, for previous terms:

u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3u_{t-2} - u_{t-3}

u_{t-2} = y_{t-2} + 3u_{t-3} - u_{t-4}

But substituting back into the equation for u_t seems messy.

Wait, maybe another approach: think of the process y_t as a linear combination of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}. So, y_t is a linear filter applied to u_t.

In that case, the characteristic roots are the roots of the denominator polynomial when expressing y_t as a rational transfer function.

But since it's an MA process, the transfer function is a ratio of polynomials, but in this case, it's a bit different because y_t includes u_t.

Wait, I think I'm stuck.

Let me try to remember: the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^i = 0, and the roots are the reciprocal of the poles of the transfer function.

But in this case, since y_t is expressed as a combination of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, and assuming that u is a white noise process, then the transfer function from u to y is given by the coefficients.

Thus, the transfer function H(r) = 1 - (-3) r - (1) r^2

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in the standard MA(q) model, y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i}, so the transfer function is H(r) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i r^i

But in our case, y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So, that's y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, H(r) = 1 - (-3) r - (1) r^2 = 1 + 3r - r^2

Thus, the characteristic equation is 1 + 3r - r^2 = 0

Wait, let's write that:

-r^2 + 3r +1 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

r^2 - 3r -1 = 0

Wait, but that's a quadratic equation, but the given options have roots 1 and -3, which are two roots, so that's fine.

So, solving r^2 - 3r -1 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

r = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 4)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(13)] / 2

Wait, but sqrt(13) is about 3.605, so the roots are approximately (3 + 3.605)/2 ≈ 3.3025 and (3 - 3.605)/2 ≈ -0.3025.

But none of the options given are these numbers. The options are 1 and 2, 1 and 0.5, 2 and -0.5, or 1 and -3.

Hmm, so according to this approach, the roots are (3 ± sqrt(13))/2, which are approximately 3.3025 and -0.3025, neither of which are in the options.

So, clearly, this approach is not yielding the correct answer as per the question, which is D: 1 and -3.

So, I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given equation is a
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The question is: 

"The characteristic roots of the MA process 

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

are. The options are: A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3. Why the correct answer is: D. 1 and -3?"

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. I remember that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is derived from the recurrence relation of the process. The general form of an MA(q) process is:

$y_t = u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + \dots + u_{t-q}$

But in this case, the given process is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Wait, that seems a bit different. Usually, the MA process has a sum of past shocks, but here we have coefficients in front of the u terms. So maybe this is not a standard MA(q) process but something else?

Hold on, perhaps this is a modified MA process or maybe it's related to a transfer function or something. Let me think about how to form the characteristic equation.

For an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is:

$1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} - \dots - \phi_q z^{-q} = 0$

Where the coefficients $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_q$ are the lag coefficients from the process. So, in this case, the process is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

But wait, this seems to have a lag of 1 and 2, and also a current term. So is this a MA(q) with q=2? Let me check:

- The term $u_t$ is present, so that would correspond to q=0? Or wait, perhaps it's a MA(q) process but with coefficients on different lags. Hmm.

Wait, actually, the general form is:

$y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i}$

But in our case, the equation is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

This seems to have terms for lags t-1, t-2, and also the current term t. That would mean that q is at least 2, but the presence of u_t complicates things. Wait, is that possible? Because in standard MA(q), the highest lag is q, but here we have t, which is lag 0.

So maybe this is not a standard MA(q) process. Alternatively, perhaps it's a MA(q) with some additional terms, making it an ARMA process? But the question specifies it's an MA process, so perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written in a different way. Let me try to rearrange the equation:

$y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

Hmm, so we have:

$y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

Is that a standard form? Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can express this as:

$y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0$

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I need to form the characteristic equation properly.

In standard MA(q) processes, the characteristic equation is found by assuming a solution of the form $y_t = z^t$, leading to:

$z^t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i}$

Then, substituting, we get:

$z^t = \phi_1 z^{t-1} + \phi_2 z^{t-2} + \dots + \phi_q z^{t-q}$

Dividing both sides by $z^t$:

$1 = \phi_1 z^{-1} + \phi_2 z^{-2} + \dots + \phi_q z^{-q}$

Which leads to the characteristic equation:

$1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} - \dots - \phi_q z^{-q} = 0$

But in our case, the process is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Wait, so the lag structure here is a bit different. It has terms for lags t-1, t-2, and also the current term. That would imply that this is not a standard MA(q) process because in standard MA, we don't have the current term in the equation unless it's a cumulative sum. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the process is expressed differently. Let me check the original equation again:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

So, rewritten, this is:

$y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

So, that can be written as:

$y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

Hmm, perhaps this is a difference equation with constant coefficients. Let me consider this difference equation:

$y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

But I'm not sure if this is an MA process or something else. Wait, maybe I can express this as a system of equations in terms of y and u.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the transfer function and relate it to the characteristic equation.

Wait, perhaps it's aARMA model? Because if it's an ARMA(p, q) model, the characteristic equation would be of degree p + q. But the question says it's an MA process, so p=0.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. In an ARMA(p, q) model, the characteristic equation is of degree p + q, and the roots are the combined roots from the AR and MA parts. But if it's purely MA, p=0, so the characteristic equation is degree q, as above.

But in our case, the given process seems to have a term u_t, which is a lag 0 term. So perhaps it's a cumulative MA(q) process where q=2, but including a lag 0 term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the process is expressed as:

$y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0$

So, the characteristic equation would be:

$1 + 3z^{-1} - z^{-2} - z = 0$

Wait, that seems more complicated.

Wait, let me try another approach. Suppose we let the process be written in terms of its generating function.

Let me denote the generating function of y_t as Y(z) = sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t}.

Similarly, U(z) is the generating function for u_t.

But the process is given as:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$ for t >=1.

So, let's write the generating function for both sides:

Sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t} = -3 Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{-t} + Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-t} + Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^{-t}

Let me compute each term.

Left-hand side: Y(z) = sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t}

Right-hand side:

First term: -3 Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{-t} = -3 z^{-1} Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{-(t-1)} = -3 z^{-1} (U(z) - u_0)

Second term: Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-t} = z^{-2} Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-(t-2)} = z^{-2} U(z)

Third term: Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^{-t} = U(z) - u_0

So, putting it all together:

Y(z) = -3 z^{-1} (U(z) - u_0) + z^{-2} U(z) + (U(z) - u_0)

Simplify the right-hand side:

= (-3 z^{-1} U(z) + 3 z^{-1} u_0) + z^{-2} U(z) + U(z) - u_0

Now, collect terms with U(z):

= [ -3 z^{-1} U(z) + z^{-2} U(z) + U(z) ] + (3 z^{-1} u_0 - u_0)

Factor out U(z):

= U(z) [ -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} + 1 ] + u_0 (3 z^{-1} - 1 )

So, left-hand side is Y(z), so:

Y(z) = U(z) [ 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} ] + u_0 (3 z^{-1} - 1 )

But since Y(z) and U(z) are generating functions for the process, and u_0 is the initial shock, perhaps we can set the constant terms to zero for the process to be stationary. So, if we set 3 z^{-1} -1 =0, then:

3 z^{-1} - 1 =0 => 3/z -1=0 => z=3

Similarly, the coefficient of U(z) is [1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}]

So, the equation is:

Y(z) = [1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}] U(z) + u_0 (3 z^{-1} -1 )

But for the process to be stationary, we can assume that u_0 is not present, or that the constant terms are zero. So, 3 z^{-1} -1=0 => z=3.

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} =0

Multiply both sides by z^2:

z^2 - 3 z +1=0

So, the quadratic equation is z² - 3 z +1=0

Solving for z:

z = [3 ± sqrt(9 -4)] /2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2

Wait, but the question says the characteristic roots are 1 and -3. But according to this, the roots are (3 + sqrt(5))/2 and (3 - sqrt(5))/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

But none of the options given match these. Wait, the options are:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the roots are (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382. These are not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the characteristic equation.

Wait, let's go back.

Given the process:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

But in the standard MA(q) process, we have y_t = sum_{i=1}^q phi_i u_{t-i}

But here, we have a term u_t, which would correspond to i=0, but in the standard MA(q), the sum starts from i=1. So, perhaps this is an MA(q+1) process? Or is it an ARMA process?

Wait, maybe the equation is written differently. Let me try to write it in terms of the AR operator.

Wait, perhaps rewriting the process as:

$y_t + u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

So, $y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} - u_t$

Wait, so perhaps we can express this as:

$y_t + u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

So, the left side is y_t + u_t, and the right side is a linear combination of u terms.

So, if I consider the operator on the left side:

1 + B, where B is the backshift operator, applied to y_t.

And on the right side, we have coefficients for u_{t-1} and u_{t-2}.

So, if I write the homogeneous equation as:

(1 + B) y_t = -3 B u_{t-1} + B^2 u_{t-2}

But perhaps it's better to write this as a system of equations.

Alternatively, considering the generating function approach again.

Wait, but earlier I got the characteristic equation as z² - 3z +1 =0, which gave roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2. Hmm.

But the correct answer is D, which suggests the roots are 1 and -3. So, perhaps the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3) = z² + 2z -3 =0.

Wait, that contradicts my previous result.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the generating function approach.

Let me try again.

Given:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

So, multiply both sides by z^{t} and sum over t from 1 to infinity.

Sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^t = Sum_{t=1}^\infty (-3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t) z^t

Left-hand side: Y(z) - y_0 = Sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^t

But assuming y_0=0 for the process to start at t=1.

Wait, y_0 is undefined here, but perhaps we can treat it as zero.

So, Left-hand side: Y(z)

Right-hand side: -3 Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^t + Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^t + Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^t

Compute each term:

First term: -3 Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^t = -3 z Sum_{t=0}^\infty u_t z^t = -3 z U(z)

Second term: Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^t = z^2 Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{t-2} = z^2 U(z)

Third term: Sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^t = U(z) - u_0

But assuming u_0 is the initial shock, which is a constant, so it can be treated as a constant term.

Therefore, combining:

Y(z) = (-3 z U(z)) + (z^2 U(z)) + (U(z) - u_0)

So, Y(z) = U(z) (-3 z + z^2 +1 ) + (-u_0)

But for the process to be stationary, perhaps we can set the constant term to zero, so:

- u_0 =0 => u_0=0

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

Y(z) = U(z) (z^2 -3 z +1 )

So, the characteristic equation is z² -3 z +1 =0

Which is same as before, with roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2.

But the given correct answer is D, which has roots 1 and -3, so the characteristic equation would be (z -1)(z +3) = z² +2z -3=0.

Hmm, so clearly, my result is different from the given answer. So, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the process is written incorrectly.

Wait, the process is given as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

Wait, in standard MA(q), we have y_t = sum_{i=1}^q phi_i u_{t-i}

But in this case, we have terms at lags t-1, t-2, and t, which is lag 0. So, it's like a combination of lags t, t-1, t-2.

But that would not be a standard MA(q), since MA only includes lags less than t, not including t itself. So, perhaps this is a different type of process.

Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of MA and AR terms. But since it's given as an MA process, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the process is written wrong? Or maybe I misread it.

Wait, let me double-check the original problem.

The characteristic roots of the MA process

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

are. The options are: A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3. Why the correct answer is: D. 1 and -3?

Wait, so the process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So, that is, y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Which is a linear combination of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}

So, perhaps this can be thought of as a moving average with coefficients on lags t, t-1, t-2. But in standard MA(q), lags are t-1, t-2, ..., t-q. So, having a lag t term is not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is meant to be written as y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which could be an ARMA(0,2) model.

Wait, if it's an ARMA(0,2), the characteristic equation would be of degree 2.

Wait, let me try that.

If it's an ARMA(0,2), then y_t = (1 - a1 B + b2 B²) u_t

But in our case, it's y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

But that would correspond to a generating function where the operator is (1 + B -3 B²), which is similar to the earlier approach.

So, the characteristic equation is 1 + B -3 B² =0

Wait, but that's a quadratic equation: -3 B² + B +1=0 => 3 B² - B -1=0

Solving: B = [1 ± sqrt(1 +12)] /6 = [1 ± sqrt(13)]/6

Hmm, but again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the process as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rewritten as y_t - u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

That is, the left-hand side is y_t - u_t, and the right-hand side is a linear combination of u's.

So, if we denote z_t = y_t - u_t, then we have:

z_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, z_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Which is a linear recurrence relation for z_t in terms of u's.

But is this a MA process? Maybe not, because z_t depends on u's.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation is found by treating z_t as the output and u_t as the input.

So, if we have:

z_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, the transfer function is:

Z(z) = (-3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z)

So, solving for Z(z)/U(z):

Z(z)/U(z) = -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2}=0

Multiply by z²:

z² +3 z -1=0

So, solving:

z = [-3 ± sqrt(9 +4)] /2 = [-3 ± sqrt(13)]/2

Wait, but again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is miswritten. Alternatively, maybe I have to consider it differently.

Wait, let's try to express the process as y_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t =0

So, the characteristic equation would be:

1 +3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} - z =0

Multiply by z²:

z² +3 z -1 - z³ =0

Wait, that would give a cubic equation: -z³ + z² +3 z -1=0

Hmm, but that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the process is written as y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which can be rewritten as y_t = (1 -3 B + B²) u_t

So, the transfer function is (1 -3 B + B²), so characteristic equation is 1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0

Multiply by z²: z² -3 z +1=0

So, same as before, roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, which are not the given options.

Wait, but the correct answer is D, which is 1 and -3. So, maybe they are referring to the characteristic equation as (z -1)(z +3) = z² +2 z -3=0

But how does that relate to our process?

Wait, perhaps if I assume that the process is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, then that can be written as y_t - u_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, so:

(y_t - u_t) +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0

So, we can represent this as a linear recurrence in terms of y and u:

y_t - u_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0

But since y_t is dependent on u's, perhaps we can write this as a system:

y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Which is a non-stationary system, but maybe if we consider the characteristic equation for the y process:

Assume y ~ MA(q), then:

y_t = sum_{i=1}^q phi_i u_{t-i}

But in our case, it's given as y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is similar to an ARMA(0,2) process, but with coefficients.

Wait, perhaps if I write the equation as:

y_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t =0

Then, the characteristic equation would be:

1 +3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} - z =0

Which is same as -z³ + z² +3 z -1=0

But that doesn't factor nicely, unless...

Wait, perhaps if I rearrange terms:

-z³ + z² +3 z -1=0 => z³ - z² -3 z +1=0

Hmm, trying to factor this cubic polynomial.

Looking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1.

Testing z=1: 1 -1 -3 +1 = -2 ≠0

Testing z=-1: -1 -1 +3 +1=2≠0

So, no rational roots. Therefore, it's not easily factorable, meaning characteristic roots are complex and not simple fractions.

But the given options are simple fractions or integers: 1, 2, 0.5, etc.

So, perhaps the process is meant to be interpreted differently.

Wait, perhaps a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

But that would be same as current term u_t with coefficient -3, which would be similar to what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is same as the given process.

But that still leads to characteristic equation z² -3 z +1=0.

Wait, unless the process is meant to be y_t = -3 u_{t} + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, then:

Sum_{i=1}^2 phi_i u_{t-i} with phi_1= -3, phi_2=1, and also including the current term u_t with coefficient 1.

Wait, no, that's mixing.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would correspond to a MA(2) process with coefficients phi1= -3 (for u_{t-1}) and phi2=1 (for u_{t-2}), but without a current term.

But in that case, the characteristic equation would be 1 - phi1 z^{-1} - phi2 z^{-2}=0, which is 1 +3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0 => z² +3 z +1=0 => roots are (-3 ± sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-3 ± 2.236)/2, which is approximately -0.382 and -2.618. Again, not matching.

Wait, but in the given process, we have a +1 u_t term, which is a lag 0 term. So, unless it's a cumulative MA(q) process, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the process is written in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given process is an ARMA(0,2) process where y_t = (1 - a B + b B²) u_t, but in this case, the coefficients are 1, -3, and 1, so the characteristic equation is 1 -3 B + B²=0, which is same as before, giving roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2.

But the given answer is 1 and -3, so perhaps it's assuming that the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0, meaning it's factoring into z² +2 z -3=0.

But how does that relate to the given process.

Wait, unless the process is written as y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would be similar to an ARMA(0,2) process.

Then, the characteristic equation is 1 +3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0, which is same as z² +3 z +1=0, which has roots (-3 ± sqrt(5))/2.

Still, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the process is written as y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, and the question is assuming that the characteristic equation is (z -1)(something)=0, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the process is actually intended to be written as y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is an ARMA(0,2) model, but then the characteristic equation would be z² +3 z +1=0, which still doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0, so the roots are 1 and -3, but why does the process have characteristic equation (z -1)(z +3)=0?

Wait, perhaps there is a different way to set up the characteristic equation. Maybe the process is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which can be rewritten as:

y_t - u_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0

So, treating this as a linear recurrence for y_t, perhaps?

But then, the characteristic equation would be:

1 - z^{-1} +3 z^{-2} - z^{-3}=0 ?

Wait, no, because it's only up to u_{t-2}, so maybe it's a third-order equation.

Wait, perhaps this is an ARMA(1,2) process? But the question says it's a MA process.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is written in a way that allows factoring.

Let me think: suppose the process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

Then, perhaps moving terms around:

y_t - u_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, (y_t - u_t) +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0

So, suppose we treat this as a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients. Then, the characteristic equation would be found by assuming a solution of the form y_t = r^t.

But since y_t depends on u_t, which is a white noise process, perhaps this is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps treating u_t as a deterministic signal, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe we can express this as a system:

If we have (1 - B) y_t = (1 - 3 B + B²) u_t

So, characteristic equation (1 - B) corresponds to AR(1) and (1 -3 B + B²) corresponds to MA(2), so the combined characteristic equation is (1 - B)(1 -3 B + B²)=0, which would give roots at z=1 and roots from 1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0, which are (3 ± sqrt(5))/2. But again, this doesn't give us 1 and -3.

Wait, perhaps if I write the process as y_t = (1 -3 B + B²) u_t, then the characteristic equation is 1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0, which is same as before.

Alternatively, if I consider that the process is a combination of MA and AR terms, but since it's given as an MA process, p=0, so it's just MA(q).

Wait, but in MA(q), all terms are lagged, but here we have a lag 0 term, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect or the process is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the process is meant to be y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would be an ARMA(0,2) model, but then the characteristic equation is different.

Wait, if the process is y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, then the transfer function is (1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}), so characteristic equation is 1 -3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0, same as before.

Wait, unless the process is written as y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is y_t - u_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0.

But that's a relation involving y_t, u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, which would lead to a non-stationary system.

Wait, perhaps if I write it as y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, then it's similar to a cumulative moving average with coefficients on the lags.

But in standard MA(q), the lags are t-1, t-2, etc., up to t-q.

But here, we have a term u_t, which is lag 0.

Wait, unless the process is y_t = sum_{i=0}^2 phi_i u_{t-i}, which is an MA(3) process.

But in that case, the process would be y_t = phi_0 u_t + phi_1 u_{t-1} + phi_2 u_{t-2}

Comparing to given, y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, phi_0=1, phi_1=-3, phi_2=1.

So, that would be an MA(3) process with coefficients 1, -3, 1.

Then, the characteristic equation is 1 - phi_0 z^{-1} - phi_1 z^{-2} - phi_2 z^{-3}=0? Wait, no.

Wait, no, for MA(q), the characteristic equation is 1 - sum_{i=1}^q phi_i z^{-i}=0

So, in this case, phi_1=-3, phi_2=1, phi_3=0?

Wait, no, it's MA(q) where q=3, but with a non-zero phi_0.

Wait, actually, no. In standard MA(q), the process is y_t = sum_{i=1}^q phi_i u_{t-i}

So, in our case, if we have phi_0 u_t + phi_1 u_{t-1} + phi_2 u_{t-2}, that's not a standard MA(q), but it's a modified version.

Therefore, perhaps, if I want to write it as a standard MA(q) with q=3, but shifted.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

But the correct answer is D: 1 and -3.

So, maybe the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0, so z² +2 z -3=0

So, let me try to see whether that can be associated with the given process.

Given process: y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, if I can find a way that the characteristic equation factors into (z -1)(z +3)=0.

Wait, suppose that.

If the characteristic equation is z² +2 z -3=0, roots at z=1 and z=-3.

So, let's see if that holds.

Suppose y_t = a u_t + b u_{t-1}, such that the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0

But in our case, we have y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

Which is a third term.

Wait, unless, perhaps, someone incorrectly factored the characteristic equation.

Wait, if the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0, then it's z² +2 z -3=0, which is different from z² -3 z +1=0.

Wait, unless the process is written incorrectly.

Wait, is there a way that given y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, the characteristic equation is (z -1)(z +3)=0.

Wait, let's write the process as:

y_t - u_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}

So, the left side is y_t - u_t, and the right side is a linear combination of u's.

So, is this a linear recurrence? It's a relation between y_t and u's.

Assuming that y_t is a linear combination of u's, so we can write it as:

(y_t - u_t) +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}=0

So, this is a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 3 (since it involves y_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}).

So, perhaps the characteristic equation is:

1 - B +3 B² - B³=0

Wait, but
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The equation given is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

And the options are:
A. 1 and 2
B. 1 and 0.5
C. 2 and -0.5
D. 1 and -3

The correct answer is supposed to be D, 1 and -3, but I want to figure out why. I'm a bit rusty on my time series, so I'll have to go through this step by step.

First, I remember that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is derived from the recurrence relation. Since it's a moving average, the equation should be in terms of the lagged error terms. The general form of an MA model is:

\( \Phi(B)y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_{d}u_{t-d} \)

Where \( \Phi(B) \) is the characteristic polynomial, \( d \) is the order of the MA part, and \( u_t \) is the white noise.

In the given equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me rewrite this equation to match the general MA form.

First, note that the equation is:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, it's of the form:

\( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \)

Comparing this with the general MA model, we have:

\( \Phi(B)y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the characteristic polynomial \( \Phi(B) \) is:

\( \Phi(B) = 1 - 3B + B^2 \)

Wait, is that right? Let me check. If we multiply out \( \Phi(B) \), it should satisfy the equation. So, substituting \( B \) into the polynomial gives:

\( \Phi(B) = 1 - 3B + B^2 \)

But in the MA model, the equation is:

\( \Phi(B)y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \)

Comparing coefficients, the right side is \( u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), which is equivalent to \( u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + 1 u_{t-2} \). So, yeah, that matches with the polynomial \( 1 - 3B + B^2 \).

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \)

To find the characteristic roots, we solve the quadratic equation:

\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \)

Using the quadratic formula, \( B = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{5}]/2 \)

Wait, so the roots are \( (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \) and \( (3 - \sqrt{5})/2 \). Hmm, but none of the options have these numbers. The options are 1, 2, 0.5, -3. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the order of the equation? Let me double-check the original equation.

Original equation: \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So that's \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So yes, the coefficients are 1 on \( u_t \), -3 on \( u_{t-1} \), and 1 on \( u_{t-2} \). So the characteristic polynomial is indeed \( 1 - 3B + B^2 \).

Alternatively, is it possible that the question is written in a different form? Wait, sometimes in MA processes, the equation is expressed as a function of lagged y's, but here it's directly in terms of u's.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is asking for the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the process. So, if the process is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), then the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), as I had before, leading to roots \( (3 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \). But these are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which are not any of the options.

Wait, the options are A: 1, 2; B:1, 0.5; C:2, -0.5; D:1, -3. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption in how the MA process is set up.

Alternatively, is it possible that the process is written in terms of y's? Like, maybe the question is supposed to be a linear recurrence in y's, not u's?

Wait, the problem says "the characteristic roots of the MA process", and the equation is given as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, it's an MA process where the current y depends on current and past u's.

But maybe the question is phrased in terms of the y's? Wait, if it's an MA process, then the equation is in terms of y's and their lags. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating AR and MA.

Wait, in an MA model, the current term is a function of past errors. So, the way it's written is correct: \( y_t \) is expressed as a linear combination of \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), etc. So, that should be correct.

Wait, but then the roots we get are not integers, but the options are all integers or simple fractions. So, maybe I'm supposed to rewrite the characteristic equation differently?

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the equation as a function of y's instead of u's.

In an MA process, sometimes the relation is expressed in terms of y's. For example, if the process is \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} + \dots \), but in this case, it's written as \( y_t = \) combination of u's.

Wait, perhaps it's an ARMA model? Because if it's just an MA, then y_t is expressed in terms of u's. But if it's an ARMA, then it also has the AR part.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the question again. It says "the characteristic roots of the MA process \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)". So, it's an MA process, so it's supposed to be only in terms of u's, not y's.

But in that case, if the process is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), then the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), as before. So, the roots are \( (3 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \), which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, not the given options.

Hmm, this is confusing. The answer is supposed to be D, 1 and -3. So, perhaps the characteristic equation is different.

Wait, maybe I need to write the characteristic polynomial in terms of y's.

Wait, in an AR model, the characteristic polynomial is derived from the recurrence relation involving y's. But in an MA model, it's derived from the relation involving u's. Maybe if I express the MA process as an AR process in terms of y's, it could have a different characteristic equation.

Wait, let me try that. So, if we have:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

We can express u_t as:

\( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

But this might not help. Alternatively, if we write the MA equation in terms of y's.

Wait, actually, another approach: sometimes, the MA process is written as:

\( y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_d u_{t-d} \)

And the characteristic equation is found by assuming a solution of the form \( y_t = B^t \). Then plugging into the equation gives:

\( B^t = \theta_1 B^{t-1} + \theta_2 B^{t-2} + \dots + \theta_d B^{t-d} \)

Dividing both sides by \( B^t \):

\( 1 = \theta_1 B^{-1} + \theta_2 B^{-2} + \dots + \theta_d B^{-d} \)

Multiplying through by \( B^d \):

\( B^d = \theta_1 B^{d-1} + \theta_2 B^{d-2} + \dots + \theta_d \)

Which rearranged gives:

\( B^d - \theta_1 B^{d-1} - \theta_2 B^{d-2} - \dots - \theta_d = 0 \)

So, for our case, the equation is:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \)

Which as we saw earlier, has roots \( (3 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \). But again, these are not integers or simple fractions, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, could the equation be written in terms of y's?

Wait, in an ARMA model, it's a combination of AR and MA. But the question specifies it's an MA process, so it shouldn't have an AR component.

Wait, perhaps the process is actually a combination of AR and MA, but the question is only considering the MA part? That seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in MA models, the characteristic equation is the same as the AR polynomial, but I think that's only for AR processes. For MA, the characteristic equation is obtained by treating the process as a linear recurrence in terms of u's.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation when the process is written as an AR process, which would require expressing y_t in terms of previous y's.

But in this case, the equation is given in terms of u's, so unless we have an AR component, I don't think we can express y_t in terms of previous y's.

Wait, unless the process is a combination of AR and MA, but the equation given is just an MA part.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the characteristic equation of an AR process, not an MA. Hmm.

Wait, if it were an AR process of order 2, the equation would be something like \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} \). The characteristic equation would be \( 1 - \theta_1 B - \theta_2 B^2 = 0 \), leading to roots given by the options. But in this case, the equation is in u's, so it's an MA process.

Wait, unless the question is phrased incorrectly. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about an AR process, but they wrote the equation as an MA? Let me check:

The question says: "The characteristic roots of the MA process \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)".

So, it's explicitly an MA process. So the equation is correctly written in terms of u's. So the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), as above.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the characteristic equation of the AR part? But in that case, it should be an ARMA model.

Wait, perhaps the process is given as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which is an MA(2) process. Then, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 \). So the roots are \( [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{5}]/2 \), which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

But again, these are not the options given. So, perhaps I need to re-examine my approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the associated AR process. But in that case, we would need to express y_t in terms of previous y's, which would require knowing the MA parameters.

Wait, maybe that's a way to get a characteristic equation.

Let me attempt that. Suppose we have the MA process:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

If I want to express y_t in terms of previous y's, I can use the fact that \( u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \). So, maybe substituting:

\( y_t = (y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}) - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( y_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Simplify:

\( y_t = y_t + 0 + 0 \)

Which gives \( y_t = y_t \), which is just an identity. That doesn't help.

So, perhaps that approach isn't useful.

Wait, maybe I should write the MA process as a linear filter and find its transfer function, then find its poles, which are the roots of the characteristic equation.

The transfer function for an MA(2) process is \( \frac{1 - 3B + B^2}{1} \), so the poles are the roots of the numerator: \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), which again gives the same roots.

Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the question is incorrect or the options are incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, another angle: sometimes in MA processes, the characteristic equation is written differently depending on how the model is expressed. For example, if the model is written as \( y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \), then the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 B^{-1} - \theta_2 B^{-2} = 0 \). Multiplying through by \( B^2 \) gives \( B^2 - \theta_1 B - \theta_2 = 0 \).

But in our case, the equation is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, writing the characteristic equation, we have:

\( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), so \( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \). So, the characteristic roots are \( [3 \pm \sqrt{5}]/2 \). These are approximately 2.618 and 0.382. So, not integers or simple fractions.

But again, the answer is supposed to be 1 and -3. How can that be?

Wait, maybe the equation is meant to be a linear recurrence in y's. Let me try that.

Suppose that the process is written as \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \). Wait, no, that would make it an ARMA model, combining AR and MA. But the given equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), so it's just an MA model.

Wait, perhaps if I multiply both sides by some factor? Let me try.

Starting from the MA equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

If I multiply both sides by \( B \), I get:

\( y_t B = u_t B - 3u_{t-1} B + u_{t-2} B \)

But shifting indices:

\( y_t B = u_{t} B - 3u_{t-1} B + u_{t-2} B \)
\( y_{t-1} B = u_{t-1} B - 3u_{t-2} B + u_{t-3} B \)

But this seems like it's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should express \( y_t \) in terms of future u's.

Wait, I don't see a straightforward way. Alternatively, perhaps interpreting the equation differently. Let me check the equation again: \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \).

Wait, if I rearrange the equation:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Hmm, but that might not help.

Wait, another approach: perhaps write the MA model as a linear recurrence relation where the characteristic equation is formed by assuming solutions of the form \( y_t = B^t \). So, plug that in:

\( B^t = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} + B^t \)

Wait, subtract \( B^t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} \)

Divide both sides by \( B^{t-2} \):

\( 0 = -3B + 1 \)

So, \( -3B + 1 = 0 \) => \( B = 1/3 \)

But that's only one root. Hmm, that suggests a root at 1/3, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me substitute \( y_t = B^t \) into the original equation:

\( B^t = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} + B^t \)

Subtract \( B^t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} \)

Factor out \( B^{t-2} \):

\( 0 = B^{t-2}(-3B + 1) \)

So, either \( B = 0 \) or \( -3B + 1 = 0 \) => \( B = 1/3 \). So, the characteristic roots are 0 and 1/3. But 0 is a root? Wait, but in an MA process, we don't typically have zero as a root? Or is it possible?

Wait, 0 is a root here because when I plug in \( B = 0 \), it satisfies the equation. But in the context of the process, does a zero root make sense? Maybe not. Because if \( y_t = 0 \) for all t, that would imply \( u_t = u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \), but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me check again.

Assume \( y_t = B^t \). Then plug into the MA equation:

\( B^t = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} + B^t \)

Subtract \( B^t \):

\( 0 = -3B^{t-1} + B^{t-2} \)

Divide both sides by \( B^{t-2} \) (assuming B ≠ 0):

\( 0 = -3B + 1 \)

So, \( B = 1/3 \). So, only one root at 1/3, and another root at 0. So, does that mean that the characteristic equation has two roots, 0 and 1/3? But 0 is a root, but then the process is a combination of a constant and a decaying exponential.

But in the given options, 0 isn't there. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Because in the MA process, the characteristic equation is associated with the transfer function, which is the ratio of the numerator (MA part) to the denominator (which is 1 for pure MA). So, the poles are the roots of the numerator.

But if I try to write the transfer function as \( \frac{1 - 3B + B^2}{1} \), then the poles are the roots of \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), which are \( (3 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \). These are approximately 2.618 and 0.381966.

But again, these are not the options.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of an AR process, but I need to reconcile the given equation with that.

Wait, if the equation is written in terms of y's, then it's an AR process. Let me try that. Suppose the process is \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \). Then, the characteristic equation would be \( 1 + 3B + B^2 = 0 \), leading to roots \( -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), which are approximately -2.414 and -0.414. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the given equation is in terms of u's, so that seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I should think of the process as an ARMA model. Let me assume that it is an ARMA(2,1) process, so that the equation is:

\( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \)

Then, the characteristic equation would be \( 1 + 3B + B^2 = 0 \), leading to roots as above. But the given equation is not like that.

Wait, unless it's miswritten. Maybe the original equation is meant to be in y's, not u's? Let me check the original question again.

"The characteristic roots of the MA process

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)"

So, it's explicitly in u's. So, unless the question is in error, or the options are, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the characteristic equation is being considered as the reciprocal of the transfer function. So, the transfer function is \( \frac{1 - 3B + B^2}{1} \), so the system function is the same, but maybe if I invert it, it's \( \frac{1}{1 - 3B + B^2} \), whose poles would be the reciprocals of the original poles.

So, the original poles are \( (3 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \), so the reciprocals are \( 2/(3 \pm \sqrt{5}) \). Rationalizing the denominator:

\( 2/(3 + \sqrt{5}) = (2)(3 - \sqrt{5})/( (3)^2 - (sqrt{5})^2 ) = (6 - 2sqrt{5})/(9 -5) = (6 - 2sqrt{5})/4 = (3 - sqrt{5})/2 ≈ 0.381966 \)

Similarly, \( 2/(3 - sqrt{5}) = (6 + 2sqrt{5})/4 = (3 + sqrt{5})/2 ≈ 2.618 \). So, same roots.

Hmm, so that doesn't help either.

Wait, is there a possibility that I misread the equation? Let me check again:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Is that \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)? Yes. So, that's the same as \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic equation in terms of the y's. So, in order to write the characteristic equation in terms of y's, we need to express u_t in terms of y's.

But in an MA process, we don't have a direct relationship unless we know the AR part. So, without an AR component, I don't think we can express u_t in terms of y's.

Wait, unless we consider that u_t is the error term, which is not observed, so we can't express y_t in terms of past y's unless it's an AR process.

Wait, maybe if the process is pure MA, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \). But again, roots are not in the options.

Wait, unless the question is inverting the process. Wait, if the process is MA, the inverse is AR, but that doesn't necessarily change the characteristic roots.

Wait, perhaps instead of treating this as an MA process, I should treat it as an AR process by assuming that y_t is a linear combination of previous y's.

Wait, but unless we have the MA part, we can't do that.

Wait, maybe I need to think of the process as a linear recurrence in terms of y's. Let me try that.

Assume that the process is an ARMA(2,1) process, but written as:

\( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \)

Then, the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3B + B^2 = 0 \), roots are \( -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), which are approximately -2.414 and -0.414. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but if the question is about the MA part of an ARMA model, then the MA part is \( u_t \), so the characteristic equation is just 1, which is a root at 0. But that's not helpful either.

Wait, I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's try using another method. Suppose we model the process as an MA(2) process, so the characteristic equation is \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \). Let me compute its roots numerically:

Discriminant D = 9 - 4 = 5.

Roots: (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 5.236/2 ≈ 2.618

(3 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.764/2 ≈ 0.382

So, approximately 2.618 and 0.382. These are both greater than 0 in absolute value, which would imply that the process is explosive if the roots are greater than 1 in absolute value. However, in this case, the roots are 2.618 and 0.382, so one root is greater than 1, and one is less than 1. So, the process is neither stable nor explosive.

But again, these are not the options given.

Wait, the options are:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

If I think about the characteristic equation \( 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0 \), perhaps someone factored it incorrectly.

Let me factor \( 1 - 3B + B^2 \):

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 1 and add up to -3. Hmm, 1 and -3.

Wait, 1 * (-3) = -3, and 1 + (-3) = -2, which is not -3. So, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as:

\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = (B - a)(B - b) \). We know a and b are the roots, which are not integers.

So, perhaps if someone incorrectly factors it as:

\( B^2 - 3B + 1 = (B - 1)(B - 2) = B^2 - 3B + 2 \), which is incorrect because it gives a different constant term.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly factors as:

\( (B - 1)(B - 1) = B^2 - 2B + 1 \), which is also incorrect. Or, someone might factor it as \( (B - something)(B - something else) \) incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the question is actually referring to the characteristic equation of the AR part, which is mistakenly written.

Wait, if I assume that the characteristic equation is 1 - 3B + B^2, then perhaps someone might have thought that the roots are 1 and -3, because 1 and -3 multiply to -3 and add to -2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, hold on, if I plug B = 1 into the equation: 1 - 3*1 + 1^2 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 ≠ 0.

If I plug B = -3: 1 - 3*(-3) + (-3)^2 = 1 + 9 + 9 = 19 ≠ 0.

So, B = 1 and B = -3 are not roots.

But maybe someone incorrectly thought that if the coefficients are 1, -3, 1, then the roots are 1 and -3.

Wait, that might be a mistake. Because for a quadratic equation \( B^2 - (sum)B + (product) = 0 \), the roots sum to the coefficient of B with a sign change, and multiply to the constant term.

In our case, the equation is \( B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0 \). So, the sum of the roots is 3, and the product is 1.

So, if someone incorrectly associated the equation with (B - 1)(B + 3) = B^2 + 2B - 3, which is different. Or, (B - 1)(B - 1) = B^2 - 2B + 1, which is also different.

Wait, maybe the person who made the question thought that the characteristic equation is 1 - 3B + B^2, and so the roots are 1 and -3, because 1 * (-3) = -3 and 1 + (-3) = -2, but in our equation, the sum is 3, not -2. So, that would be a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is meant to be an AR process, but with AR coefficients. So, for example, if it's an AR(2) process, the equation is \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} \), then the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3B + B^2 = 0 \), which has roots \( -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), approximately -2.414 and -0.414. Not matching the options.

Wait, but if someone thought the equation is \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \), and then thought it's just the MA part, which is \( u_t \), then the characteristic equation of the MA part is 1, which is a root at 0. But that's not helpful either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the characteristic equation of the system, treating it as a linear recurrence in y's. But as we saw before, that leads to a characteristic equation with roots 0 and 1/3.

Wait, so perhaps the person who made the question thought that the characteristic equation for the MA process is 1 - 3B + B^2, and hence roots at 1 and -3, but that's incorrect because that equation doesn't have those roots.

Wait, let me plug in B = 1: 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 ≠ 0.

B = -3: 1 - (-9) + 9 = 1 + 9 + 9 = 19 ≠ 0.

So, 1 and -3 are not roots.

Wait, maybe they thought that since the coefficients are 1, -3, 1, that the roots are 1 and -3. But that's not correct because the equation doesn't factor that way.

Alternatively, maybe the person who wrote the question thought that in moving average, the characteristic equation is (1 - B)(1 - 3B) = 1 - 4B + 3B^2, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the process is written incorrectly, and it's meant to be:

\( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \), which would be an ARMA(2,1) model, then the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3B + B^2 = 0 \), with roots \( -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), which again isn't matching.

Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the system, but in the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the person thought that the characteristic equation is 1 - 3B + B^2, and then factoring it as (B - 1)(B - 1) = 1 - 2B + B^2, which is wrong, but then getting roots at 1 with multiplicity 2.

But 1 is not paired with -3.

Wait, maybe in an attempt to factor, someone thought of 1 and -3 as roots because they thought that adding up to -2, but in our equation, the sum is 3, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Options:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

Wait, if I assume that the characteristic equation is 1 - 3B + B^2 = 0, but someone incorrectly thought that it's 1 - (1 + 2)B + B^2 = 0, then the roots would be 1 and 2. Because 1 - 3B + B^2 can be written as (B - 1)(B - 2) + something. Wait, no, (B - 1)(B - 2) = B^2 - 3B + 2, which is different.

Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the coefficients correspond to roots 1 and -3, even though it's not the case.

Wait, I think this is going nowhere. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic roots of the process when written in terms of y's, even though it's an MA process.

Wait, suppose I have:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

And I want to express this in terms of y's. But without knowing the AR part, I can't directly express u_t in terms of y's. So, unless it's an ARMA model, which it's not, I can't do that.

Wait, perhaps the process is a combination of AR and MA, but it's written only as MA. That is, maybe it's actually an AR process, but missing an AR part.

Wait, another idea: in some textbooks, the characteristic equation of an MA process is defined when the process is rewritten as a linear recurrence in terms of y's and its lags. But that would require an AR component.

Wait, I think I need to conclude that perhaps the question is incorrect, or the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the original equation is different. Wait, the equation was \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). If I rearrange it:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)


[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The question is a bit confusing at first, but I think I can work through it step by step. Let me try to figure it out.

First, the question gives me the recurrence relation for the MA process:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

It asks for the characteristic roots, and the options are:
A. 1 and 2
B. 1 and 0.5
C. 2 and -0.5
D. 1 and -3

And it mentions that the correct answer is D, which is 1 and -3. But I need to understand why that is the case.

So, let me recall what a moving average process is. In an MA model, the current term is a linear combination of the past few terms of the series. The coefficients of this linear combination are the moving average coefficients. The characteristic equation of an MA process is derived similarly to that of an AR process but with a twist.

In an AR process, the characteristic equation is set to zero, like \( 1 - \phi_1 x - \phi_2 x^2 - \dots - \phi_p x^p = 0 \). For an MA process, since the current term depends on past terms, the characteristic equation is similar but with a different setup. Specifically, the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 x - \theta_2 x^2 - \dots - \theta_q x^q = 0 \)

Where \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_q \) are the coefficients from the moving average polynomial.

Wait, actually, I think I might have mixed up AR and MA. In the AR case, the coefficients are multiplied by powers of x, while in the MA case, they are coefficients of the lagged terms. So, perhaps the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is:

\( \sum_{t=0}^q \theta_t y_{t-k} } = 0 \)

But I might need a more precise approach.

Alternatively, I can represent the MA process as a linear recurrence relation. For a simple MA(2) process, the relation is:

\( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} \)

But in this question, it's given as:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Hmm, wait. I need to clarify whether \( u_t \) is the original series or the innovations. Typically, in an MA model, \( u_t \) is the white noise, or the innovations, which are uncorrelated and have zero mean.

But in this case, the equation is given in terms of \( u_t \), which suggests that \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of past \( u \)'s. So, if I write the equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

This seems to be a linear combination of the lagged innovations. So, perhaps the MA(q) model is written as:

\( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

In this question, \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which can be rewritten as:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, in this case, the coefficients are 1 for \( u_t \), -3 for \( u_{t-1} \), and 1 for \( u_{t-2} \). Therefore, it's an MA(2) process, right? Because the highest lag is 2.

So, to find the characteristic roots, I need to form the characteristic equation. For an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 x - \theta_2 x^2 - \dots - \theta_q x^q = 0 \)

Wait, is that correct? Or is it similar to the AR case?

Wait, no. For AR, the characteristic equation is derived by assuming a solution of the form \( y_t = x^t \). Plugging this into the AR equation gives the characteristic equation. For MA, since the equation is \( y_t = \sum_{t=1}^q \theta_t y_{t-k} \), perhaps we can find the roots differently.

Alternatively, since this is a linear recurrence relation, maybe we can express it in terms of \( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \). But that might not be the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about this as a linear recurrence for the process \( y_t \). So, if we have:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Then, rearranging:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But that might not be a standard linear recurrence because it's mixing \( y_t \) with \( u_t \). Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, since \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of the lagged \( u \)'s, perhaps we can write the generating function for \( y_t \) and find the roots from there.

But perhaps another method: since \( u_t \) is the white noise, with variance and zero mean, perhaps the process \( y_t \) inherits properties from the \( u_t \) but with a moving average.

Wait, in the case of an MA(q) model, the process \( y_t \) is obtained by averaging the past q innovations. So, in this case, it's a linear combination of past two innovations.

So, the recurrence relation is \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \).

To find the characteristic roots, perhaps we can write the homogeneous recurrence relation for \( y_t \).

In other words, write the equation as:

\( y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} = u_t \)

Wait, that seems a bit off.

Wait, let me try to rephrase. Since \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), perhaps I can rearrange this as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But \( y_t \) is a linear combination of \( u \)'s, so perhaps I can think of it as a linear recurrence for \( y_t \) in terms of \( u_t \). 

Wait, but actually, \( u_t \) is the white noise, so it's uncorrelated with past terms. So perhaps the process \( y_t \) is a linear combination of the white noise with coefficients in the MA model.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the characteristic equation of the MA process. For an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is given by:

\( 1 - \theta_1 x - \theta_2 x^2 - \dots - \theta_q x^q = 0 \)

But in this case, the coefficients are 1 for \( u_t \), -3 for \( u_{t-1} \), and 1 for \( u_{t-2} \). So, the characteristic equation would be:

\( 1 - (-3)x -1 x^2 = 0 \)

Wait, that seems unclear. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the AR case, the process is \( y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + \phi_p y_{t-p} \), and we set the characteristic equation \( 1 - \phi_1 x - \dots - \phi_p x^p = 0 \).

For the MA case, the process is \( y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \), and we can consider the characteristic equation as:

\( 1 - \theta_1 x - \theta_2 x^2 - \dots - \theta_q x^q = 0 \)

Wait, is that correct? So, if I have:

\( y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

Then, to find the characteristic roots, we can substitute \( u_t \) as if it were a white noise process, but that might not directly give the characteristic equation.

Alternatively, another approach is to write the recurrence relation for \( y_t \) and express it as a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, then find the roots of the characteristic equation.

Given that \( y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \), no, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, wait, hold on. The question gives \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, I can't assume a relation between \( y_t \) and past \( y \)'s because \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of past \( u \)'s, which are the innovations.

So, perhaps I should consider the relation as a linear recurrence for \( y_t \) in terms of \( u \)'s, but since \( u \)'s are white noise, which are uncorrelated, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a linear filter. The characteristic roots of a linear filter relate to its frequency response, which is the transfer function, which in turn relates to the poles and zeros.

In this case, the filter is \( H(x) = 1 + (-3)x^{-1} + x^{-2} \), because the coefficients correspond to the filter coefficients.

Wait, in signal processing, the transfer function is given by:

\( H(x) = 1 + \theta_1 x^{-1} + \theta_2 x^{-2} + \dots + \theta_q x^{-q} \)

Where \( \theta_1, \dots, \theta_q \) are the coefficients. So, in this case, for the given recurrence:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Which can be written as:

\( H(x) = 1 + (-3) x^{-1} + 1 x^{-2} \)

So, that is:

\( H(x) = 1 - 3x^{-1} + x^{-2} \)

To find the characteristic roots, we can set \( H(x) \) equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

\( 1 - 3x^{-1} + x^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( x^2 \) to eliminate the denominators:

\( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation is \( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 \).

Now, let's find the roots of this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:

\( x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Hmm, that gives roots of \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Wait, but the options given don't include these numbers. The options are 1, 2, 0.5, -0.5, etc.

Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps I need to set up the characteristic equation differently.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the recurrence relation for \( y_t \) in terms of \( y_{t-1} \), but in the given problem, \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u \)'s. So, maybe I should express \( y_t \) in terms of \( y_{t-1} \) by using the fact that \( u_t = y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} \).

Let me try that. Given \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), I can rearrange it:

\( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But also, \( u_t = y_t - 3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} \)

So, substituting \( u_t \) into the equation:

\( y_t - (y_t - 3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2}) + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( y_t - y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe another approach. Since the process \( y_t \) is an MA(2) process with coefficients 1, -3, and 1 for lags 0, -1, and -2 respectively, perhaps the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - (-3)x -1 x^2 = 0 \)

Wait, that is:

\( 1 + 3x - x^2 = 0 \)

Which is the same as:

\( -x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \)

But that's quadratic equation. Let's solve:

\( x^2 - 3x -1 = 0 \)

Using quadratic formula:

\( x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2} \)

Which again doesn't match the given options.

Wait, maybe I'm defining the characteristic equation incorrectly. Maybe since \( y_t \) is a linear combination of past \( u \)'s, the characteristic equation is constructed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation is derived by considering the relation in terms of \( y \)'s.

Given:

\( y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct because \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u \)'s, not \( y \)'s.

So, maybe I need to write a linear recurrence for \( y_t \) in terms of its own past. But since \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u \)'s, which are uncorrelated with past \( y \)'s, maybe I can find the transfer function or the covariance function.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a linear filter and find the poles and zeros. The filter is given by:

\( H(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \)

Which can be written as:

\( H(z) = \frac{1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1} \)

To find the poles, set the numerator equal to zero:

\( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \)

Which is the same equation as before, giving roots at \( z = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Hmm, which still doesn't match the answer.

Wait, but the answer is given as 1 and -3. So, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic roots in a different way. Maybe it's considering the characteristic equation when expressed in terms of \( y \)'s.

But as I thought earlier, \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u \)'s, so we can't directly write a recurrence between \( y \)'s unless we express \( u \)'s in terms of \( y \)'s.

Given that \( u_t = y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} \), from the original equation:

\( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Substituting \( u_t = y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} \), we get:

\( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + (y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2}) \)

Simplify:

\( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + y_t + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} \)

Subtract \( y_t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + 3 y_{t-1} - y_{t-2} \)

But this still involves \( u \)'s and \( y \)'s, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation is related to the inverse filter. Since \( H(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), then the inverse filter is \( 1 / H(z) = 1 + 3 z + z^2 \). Maybe the roots of the inverse filter are considered?

But then, the inverse filter's poles correspond to the original filter's zeros, and vice versa.

So, if the original filter has zeros at \( z = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then the inverse filter would have poles there. But that doesn't directly give us the roots of 1 and -3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps I can treat the given equation as a linear recurrence for \( y_t \), assuming that \( y_t \) can be expressed as a linear combination of \( y_{t-1} \) and \( y_{t-2} \). But in the given equation, \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u \)'s, which are not part of the same process. So, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire process as a vector recursive equation.

Let me consider the state vector \( \mathbf{y}_t = [y_t; y_{t-1}] \). Then, the equation can be written as:

\( \mathbf{y}_t = [u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}] \)

But this seems unclear.

Wait, another thought: since we have a linear combination of lagged \( u \)'s, maybe we can think of this as a linear filter and use the concept of characteristic roots accordingly.

In signal processing, the transfer function \( H(z) \) for an MA(q) filter is given by \( 1 + \theta_1 z^{-1} + \theta_2 z^{-2} + \dots + \theta_q z^{-q} \). The zeros of \( H(z) \) correspond to the roots of the characteristic equation \( 1 + \theta_1 z^{-1} + \theta_2 z^{-2} + \dots + \theta_q z^{-q} = 0 \).

Wait, in this case, the transfer function is:

\( H(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \)

So, to find the zeros, set \( H(z) = 0 \):

\( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \), which has roots at \( z = [3 ± sqrt(5)] / 2 \). Again, that gives the roots as approximately (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618 and (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.382. These are not integers or simple fractions, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, but the problem is about characteristic roots, which in the context of linear recursions, are roots of the characteristic equation. So, if the recurrence is in terms of \( y_t \), the characteristic roots are the eigenvalues of the companion matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation should be expressed in terms of \( y_t \) in terms of past \( y \)'s.

Wait, but the given equation is \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). Unless \( u_t \) is expressed in terms of \( y \)'s, which we can do.

From the original equation, \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), we can solve for \( u_t \):

\( u_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Similarly, for \( u_{t-1} \), we have from the same equation with index \( t-1 \):

\( u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3 u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} \)

But this might lead us into an infinite recursion.

Alternatively, let me try to express this as a linear recurrence for \( y_t \) by substituting the expression for \( u_t \).

Given that \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), and we have \( u_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \), plugging this into the equation:

\( y_t = (y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}) - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Simplify:

\( y_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

Which simplifies to:

\( y_t = y_t + 0 + 0 \)

So, 0=0. That's just an identity, which doesn't help.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the process is a combination of the current innovation and the past ones, so the characteristic roots can be found by looking at how the process reacts to the innovations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, 1 and -3, because when you set up the characteristic equation by assuming solutions \( r^t \), let me try that.

Assume a solution \( y_t = r^t \). Plugging into the given equation:

\( r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t \)

Wait, that seems odd.

Wait, no. Wait, the equation is \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). If I assume a solution \( y_t = r^t \) and substitute, I get:

\( r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t \)

Subtract \( r^t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} \)

Factor out \( r^{t-2} \):

\( 0 = r^{t-2} (-3 r + 1) \)

Since this must hold for all t, the coefficient must be zero:

\( -3 r + 1 = 0 \implies r = 1/3 \)

But that only gives one root, 1/3, which is not among the options. So, perhaps this approach is not suitable.

Wait, perhaps I should express this as a linear recurrence for the process \( y_t \) in terms of its own past. But since \( y_t \) is in terms of \( u \)'s, which are the innovations, maybe I need to relate \( u \)'s to \( y \)'s.

From the original equation, \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), we can express \( u_t \) as:

\( u_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Similarly, for \( u_{t-1} \):

\( u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3 u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} \)

But this seems like it's going to infinity.

Wait, another idea: if I look at the process as a linear filter, then the characteristic roots are the reciprocals of the poles. Wait, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are 1 and -3 because when you set the characteristic equation equal to zero, you get roots at x=1 and x=-3.

Wait, let me try that. If I set up the characteristic equation as \( (x - 1)(x + 3) = x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \). Wait, that doesn't give me the equation we had earlier.

Alternatively, if I suppose the characteristic equation is \( (x - 1)(x + 3) = 0 \), then the roots are 1 and -3. But how does this relate to our process?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me think.

Given that the process is an MA(2), we can write the generating function \( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t} \). Then, express \( Y(z) \) in terms of \( U(z) \).

Given \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), we can write:

\( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty (u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}) z^{-t} \)

Breaking this up:

\( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^{-t} - 3 \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{-t} + \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-t} \)

Shifting indices:

First term: \( \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^{-t} = U(z) - u_0 \) (if u_0 is defined, but usually we start at t=1, so maybe it's just U(z)).

Second term: \( -3 \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-1} z^{-t} = -3 z^{-1} \sum_{t=0}^\infty u_t z^{-t} = -3 z^{-1} U(z) \)

Third term: \( \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-t} = z^{-2} \sum_{t=-1}^\infty u_t z^{-t} \). Wait, but that includes t=-1, which is problematic. So, perhaps better to adjust the indices:

\( \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-t} = z^{-2} \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_{t-2} z^{-(t-2)} } = z^{-2} \sum_{s=-1}^\infty u_s z^{-s} \), where \( s = t - 2 \).

Again, problematic at s=-1, unless we define u_0 = 0. So, assuming u_0 = 0, this becomes:

\( z^{-2} \sum_{s=0}^\infty u_s z^{-s} = z^{-2} U(z) \)

Putting it all together:

\( Y(z) = U(z) - 3 z^{-1} U(z) + z^{-2} U(z) \)

Factor out U(z):

\( Y(z) = U(z) (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) \)

Which is consistent with the filter representation we had earlier.

So, the transfer function is \( H(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), so the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \), with roots \( z = [3 ± sqrt(5)] / 2 \).

But given that the answer is D, 1 and -3, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing moving average with autoregressive.

Wait, in an AR(2) process, the model is \( y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} \), and the characteristic roots are related to the AR coefficients.

But in this case, it's an MA(2) process, so if someone mistakenly confused MA with AR, they might set up the characteristic equation as \( 1 - \theta_1 x - \theta_2 x^2 = 0 \), but with the coefficients reversed.

Wait, for the given MA(2) process \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \), as before.

But perhaps the question is mistakenly referring to the characteristic equation as \( (1 - x)(1 + 3x) = 0 \), which would give roots at x=1 and x=-1/3, but that's not matching the options either.

Wait, maybe a different approach. Since the correct answer is D, 1 and -3, perhaps the question is about the roots of the polynomial when set to zero by substituting y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the characteristic roots are the roots of the equation derived from the process equation, setting y_t = r^t.

Wait, let's try that again: assume \( y_t = r^t \). Plug into the equation:

\( r^t = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} + r^t \)

Subtract \( r^t \) from both sides:

\( 0 = -3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2} \)

Factor out \( r^{t-2} \):

\( 0 = r^{t-2} (-3 r + 1) \)

Which implies \( -3 r + 1 = 0 \), so \( r = 1/3 \). So, only one root again. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the process as an AR process. If I mistakenly treat it as an AR(2) process with coefficients corresponding to the lags, but that might not be correct.

Wait, since the given process is \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), if we consider that, perhaps it's an AR(2) process with coefficients 1 (for u_t), -3 (for u_{t-1}), and 1 (for u_{t-2}).

But that would be a bit unconventional because usually AR processes have coefficients in terms of past y's, not u's. So, perhaps it's a mixed model or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic equation is formed by substituting \( y_t = r^t \) into the equation, treating it as a linear recurrence in terms of y's.

But in order to do that, we need the equation expressed in terms of y's. Since \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of u's, maybe I can express u's in terms of y's.

From the original equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

We can rearrange to solve for u_t:

\( u_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Similarly, for \( u_{t-1} \):

\( u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3 u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} \)

Wait, but this seems recursive and might not lead me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression in terms of y's.

Given:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

And:

\( y_{t-1} = u_{t-1} - 3 u_{t-2} + u_{t-3} \)

\( y_{t-2} = u_{t-2} - 3 u_{t-3} + u_{t-4} \)

But again, this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic roots of the process in terms of the filter's poles, but I thought we covered that already.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the process can be written as a linear combination of delayed processes. So, if I consider the process \( y_t \), then \( y_t = u_t + (-3) u_{t-1} + (1) u_{t-2} \). So, each term is a delayed version of the innovation.

In such cases, the characteristic roots can be found by considering the recurrence equation. So, perhaps I can write the recurrence as:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

But that still doesn't help me find a characteristic equation in terms of y's.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is to consider the process as a linear time-invariant system and find its impulse response. The roots of the system's transfer function give the nature of the response.

But the transfer function is \( H(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), as established earlier. So, the zeros of this transfer function are the roots of \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \), which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, as before.

But again, these don't match the options given.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation in terms of the inverse filter, as in \( 1 / H(z) \).

The inverse filter is \( 1 / (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) = (1 - 3 z + z^2) / (1 - 6 z + 9 z^2) \). Hmm, but the denominator is \( 1 - 6 z + 9 z^2 \), which can be written as \( (1 - 3 z)^2 \).

Wait, so the inverse filter has a double pole at z=1/3. But that's again a single root with multiplicity two, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the characteristic equation differently. Maybe treating the given equation as a linear recurrence for u_t in terms of y's.

Wait, from \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), we can express:

\( u_t = y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} \)

Similarly, \( u_{t-1} = y_{t-1} + 3 u_{t-2} - u_{t-3} \)

But plugging this back into the equation for \( u_t \) gives:

\( u_t = y_t + 3(y_{t-1} + 3 u_{t-2} - u_{t-3}) - u_{t-2} \)

Simplify:

\( u_t = y_t + 3 y_{t-1} + 9 u_{t-2} - 3 u_{t-3} - u_{t-2} \)

\( u_t = y_t + 3 y_{t-1} + 8 u_{t-2} - 3 u_{t-3} \)

This seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe I need to accept that I can't directly form a linear recurrence for y_t in terms of y's without involving u's, so
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is D, which says that the characteristic roots of the MA process given by the equation \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) are 1 and -3. Hmm, let me recall what I know about multiple-choice questions and characteristic roots.

First, I remember that for a moving average (MA) process, the characteristic equation is derived from the recurrence relation. The general form of an MA process is \( y_t = \sum_{i=1}^{d} \theta_i u_{t-i} \), where \( u_t \) is the white noise and \( d \) is the order of the MA process.

Given the equation \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), I notice that the coefficients are -3, 1, and 1. Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me check the indices again. For an MA process, the terms should be lagged by 1, 2, ..., up to the order \( d \). But here, the highest lag is 1, but there's also a \( u_t \), which is a lag of 0. Hmm, so does that mean the order is 3? Or is it 2?

Wait, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, \( u_t \) is the current term, which is lag 0, \( u_{t-1} \) is lag 1, and \( u_{t-2} \) is lag 2. So actually, the MA process has a lag structure of 0, 1, and 2, meaning the order \( d = 2 \) because it goes up to lag 2. But wait, sometimes I get confused whether the order is equal to the highest lag or the highest lag plus one.

Let me confirm. In an MA(d) process, the highest lag is d, so with lags 0, 1, 2, it's MA(2). But then why is the equation written as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)? So, that would mean that the coefficient for \( u_{t-1} \) is -3, for \( u_{t-2} \) is 1, and for \( u_t \), which is \( u_{t-0} \), is also 1. So, the coefficients are \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), and \( \theta_2 = 1 \). So, the characteristic equation of an MA(d) process is given by \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \).

So, for this case, \( d = 2 \), so the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - (-3)z^{-1} - 1z^{-2} = 0 \)

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me write it step by step.

The general characteristic equation for MA(d) is:

\( 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{d} \theta_k z^{-k} = 0 \)

But in this case, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which can be rewritten as:

\( \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} = y_t \)

where \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), and \( \theta_2 = 1 \). So, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \)

So substituting the values:

\( 1 - (-3)z^{-1} - 1z^{-2} = 0 \)

Simplify that:

\( 1 + 3z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

Wait, but usually, the characteristic equation is written as \( 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{d} \theta_k z^{-k} = 0 \). Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.

Another approach is to set up the recurrence relation. For an MA(d) process, the recurrence is:

\( y_t - \theta_0 y_{t-1} - \theta_1 y_{t-2} - ... - \theta_d y_{t-d} = 0 \)

Wait, is that right? Or is it:

\( y_t + \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \theta_d y_{t-d} = 0 \)

I think I need to recall the correct form. Let me think. For a simple MA(1), the process is \( y_t = \theta_1 u_t \), and the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} = 0 \). So, the general form is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \). Therefore, for our case, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - (-3)z^{-1} - 1z^{-2} = 0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 1 + 3z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

But maybe it's better to multiply both sides by \( z^2 \) to eliminate the denominators.

Multiplying each term by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 \cdot 1 + 3z \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 0 \)

So, that gives:

\( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \)

Wait, so the characteristic equation is \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \). Then, the roots are the solutions to this quadratic equation.

Using the quadratic formula, \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 1 \).

So, discriminant \( D = 9 - 4(1)(1) = 9 - 4 = 5 \).

Therefore, roots are \( z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Wait a minute, but the options given are 1 and -3, 1 and 0.5, 2 and -0.5, or 1 and -3.

Hmm, none of these options are \( \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so that suggests I might have made a mistake in forming the characteristic equation.

Let me try another approach. Maybe I confused the coefficients. Let me think. The given process is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, expressed in terms of \( y_t \), it's \( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \). Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the recurrence relation. The MA process is expressed as \( y_t + \theta_1 y_{t-1} + \theta_2 y_{t-2} = u_t \). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up AR and MA.

Wait, no. Let's see, for an AR(1) process, we have \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t \). For an MA(1) process, it's \( y_t = \theta_1 u_t + u_{t-1} \). Wait, actually, no, that's not quite.

Wait, it's been a while since I've dealt with AR and MA processes. Maybe I need to step back.

The given equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, this is a linear combination of \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), and \( u_{t-2} \). So, it is indeed an MA process of order 2 because the highest lag is 2.

In general, the MA process has the form \( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \). So, in this case, \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \), and \( \theta_0 = 1 \) is implied.

So, to find the characteristic roots, we can use the characteristic equation for MA processes, which is given by \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \).

Substituting \( \theta_1 = -3 \) and \( \theta_2 = 1 \), we get:

\( 1 - (-3)z^{-1} - 1z^{-2} = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( 1 + 3z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \) to remove negative powers:

\( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \)

Okay, so that's the characteristic equation, which is quadratic: \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Solving for z, using quadratic formula:

\( z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, the roots are \( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Wait, but none of these options match the given options. The options are:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

Hmm, so either I'm making a mistake here or maybe I misinterpreted the question.

Wait, hold on. Is the given equation correctly interpreted as an MA process? Let me check.

The equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, that is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, yes, it's a linear combination of \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), and \( u_{t-2} \). So, it is indeed an MA(2) process.

But the characteristic equation is quadratic, so it should have two roots, which are complex or real. In this case, as we saw, the roots are real: \( \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Approximately, \( \sqrt{5} \) is about 2.236, so the roots would be approximately \( (-3 + 2.236)/2 = (-0.764)/2 ≈ -0.382 \) and \( (-3 - 2.236)/2 = (-5.236)/2 ≈ -2.618 \). So, roughly -0.382 and -2.618.

Looking at the options, none of them match these values. The options given are 1 and -3; 1 and 0.5; 2 and -0.5; or 1 and -3. Wait, option D is 1 and -3, which are integers. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I miswrote the characteristic equation.

Wait, maybe I should be using a different characteristic equation for MA processes. Let me double-check.

I found conflicting information before, but usually, the characteristic equation for an MA(d) process is given by \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \). So, for our process, that would be \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} + 1 z^{-2} = 0 \), which is what I did before, leading to \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct characteristic equation is derived differently. Maybe for the AR process, it's \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \), but for MA processes, it's similar.

Wait, no, actually, let me check again. For a stationary ARMA process, the characteristic equation is the same whether it's AR or MA. So, for an ARMA(p,d) model, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - ... - \phi_p z^{-p} - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \). But here, we're only dealing with an MA process, so p=0, so the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \). So, in our case, since it's MA(2), the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} + 1 z^{-2} = 0 \), which is \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \). So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the characteristic roots are the solutions to \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \), which are \( z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \), approximately -0.38 and -2.62.

But the answer option is D: 1 and -3. So, clearly, something is wrong here. Maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.

The question states: The characteristic roots of the MA process

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

are...

Wait, perhaps I misread the equation. Is it \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)? That is, is it \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), yes. So, the coefficients are 1 for \( u_t \), -3 for \( u_{t-1} \), and 1 for \( u_{t-2} \).

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the characteristic equation when considering the process as a difference equation, so perhaps I need to write the homogeneous equation.

Let me try setting up the difference equation. For an MA process, the difference equation is obtained by substituting the moving average into the output. But wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, maybe we should express it as a recurrence relation. For an MA process, the relation is \( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \). So, the characteristic equation is the same as for an AR process in this case because it's a finite sum.

Wait, perhaps using the method for AR processes. For AR(p), the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - ... - \phi_p z^{-p} = 0 \). For MA(d), it's similar but with coefficients from the moving average.

Wait, perhaps I can write the recurrence as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Wait, hold on, that's not a standard recurrence.

Alternatively, let me think of the process as a linear filter. The transfer function of an MA(d) filter is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d}} \). So, perhaps the poles of the transfer function are the reciprocals of the characteristic roots.

Wait, but since the transfer function is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d}} \), the poles are at the roots of the denominator. So, the denominator is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \), which is the same as the characteristic equation.

Therefore, the poles are at \( z = \frac{-\theta_1 \pm \sqrt{\theta_1^2 + 4\theta_2 + ... + 4\theta_d}}{2} \). Wait, I think I need to get back.

Wait, actually, maybe I should use the method of forming the characteristic equation by using the process equation.

Starting from \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), we can rewrite this as \( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to express this as a linear recurrence relation for y_t. Let me consider the process equation and the white noise equation.

For an MA process, the output y_t is a linear combination of the past white noises u_{t-k}, and the white noise itself is uncorrelated with previous terms.

Therefore, to find the characteristic equation, I can use the method for AR processes, treating y_t as the output and setting up the homogeneous equation.

So, if we have \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), and assuming that the white noise has mean zero and is uncorrelated, we can model the process as a linear filter.

To find the characteristic equation, we can write \( y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0 \).

Wait, but this seems mixed because y_t depends on u_t, but u_t is not a function of y_{t-1}, so perhaps this isn't the standard way.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the process as a system of equations.

Let me suppose that the process is of order 2. So, we can write:

\( y_t = u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \)

Comparing this to the given equation:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, that gives us \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \). Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \)

Substituting the values:

\( 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( 1 + 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \)

So, again, this leads to the characteristic equation \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \), with roots \( z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). So, these are approximately -2.618 and -0.382. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, but the answer is D: 1 and -3, so perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, hold on. The process is given as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). Is that an AR process? Because the highest lag is t, meaning that it's a current term, which is lag 0, so if it's a current term, is it an AR process?

Wait, no, in AR processes, the current term is on the left side, like \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t \), but here, the current term is on the right side, so it's an MA process.

Wait, but if I rearrange the equation:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the highest lag term is u_{t-2}, meaning that it's MA(2). So, the process is MA(2), so it should have two roots.

But perhaps the question is about the characteristic roots of the associated AR process? Maybe I confused AR and MA.

Wait, in the AR process, the current term is on the left, and in MA, it's on the right. So, for AR, the process is \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t \), and the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} = 0 \). For MA, it's \( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + ... + \theta_d u_{t-d} \), and the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \).

Wait, so unless we can express the given equation as an AR process, but it's written with the current term on the right, which is an MA process.

So, perhaps I need to see if the given equation can be rewritten as an AR process.

Wait, but in an AR process, the current term y_t is expressed in terms of the previous term y_{t-1} and the noise term u_t. So, in our case, the given equation is y_t expressed in terms of u_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. So, that is an MA process.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of AR and MA. But the equation is given as a pure MA.

Wait, unless there's a typo or misinterpretation in the question. Let me read it again:

"The characteristic roots of the MA process

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

are."

So, it is an MA process, with the given equation. So, the process is MA(2), with coefficients as given.

So, if the characteristic equation is \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \), with roots as above, but the answer is D: 1 and -3.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps I need to consider the characteristic equation from a different angle.

Wait, maybe I have the equation wrong. Let me think: If we have \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), perhaps the characteristic equation is formed by shifting indices.

In other words, the recurrence is:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, moving everything to one side:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But that's not a standard linear recurrence because y_t is not expressed in terms of previous y's. So, perhaps I need to model it differently.

Alternatively, since it's an MA process, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \), as before.

But in our case, \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \), so:

\( 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 0 \implies 1 + 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \implies z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \).

So, the roots are complex? No, discriminant is 5, which is positive, so two real roots.

But the options do not include these roots. So, what is going on?

Wait, perhaps the process is actually an AR process. Let me test that.

Suppose it's an AR process, then the equation would be \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t \). But in our case, it's \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, unless it's a mixed model, but the question says it's an MA process.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the process as a two-sided filter and the characteristic roots correspond to something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the characteristic equation is actually obtained by considering the process as a linear recurrence.

Assuming that y_t is the output and u_t is the input, then for an MA process, the characteristic equation is the same as for the transfer function.

Wait, but the transfer function for MA is reciprocal of the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, I think I need to step back and check definitions.

In AR processes, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - ... - \phi_p z^{-p} = 0 \), with roots inside the unit circle.

In MA processes, the characteristic equation is similar, but it's \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - ... - \theta_d z^{-d} = 0 \), with roots on the unit circle.

Wait, so for our process, \( 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 0 \implies 1 + 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \implies z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \). So, the roots are \( z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which are approximately -2.618 and -0.382. Both of these are inside the unit circle?

Wait, -2.618 is outside the unit circle, and -0.382 is inside. So, since the process is MA, which is a moving average, it should have poles on the unit circle, but here, we have one inside and one outside.

Wait, this suggests that the process is non-invertible because one root is inside and the other is outside the unit circle.

But since the question is about the characteristic roots, not invertibility.

But still, the options don't match.

Wait, maybe it's a typo in the question, or perhaps the given equation is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to model it as a two-sided MA process? So, for a two-sided MA process, the equation would include terms from t=0 to t=2, but in this case, the equation is given as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \).

Wait, but actually, a two-sided MA process would have terms on both sides, symmetric around t.

But here, it's given as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which is a one-sided MA process.

Wait, unless the process is two-sided, but the equation is given as one-sided.

Alternatively, maybe I miswrote the characteristic equation, because for an MA process, sometimes the characteristic equation is written differently.

Wait, another resource I recall: For an MA(d) process, the characteristic roots are the solutions to \( 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{d} \theta_k z^{-k} = 0 \). So, as before, we have \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} + 1 z^{-2} = 0 \implies z^2 + 3 z + 1 = 0 \).

Alternatively, is there a different way to derive the characteristic equation?

Wait, let's try another method: Assume that y_t satisfies the process equation, then y_{t+1} would satisfy:

\( y_{t+1} = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t+1} \)

Similarly, y_{t+2}:

\( y_{t+2} = -3u_{t+1} + u_t + u_{t+2} \)

But if we assume that the process is a linear recurrence, we can write the equation for y_{t+1} and y_t.

Wait, if I can express y_{t+1} in terms of y_t and u's, but it seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method for ARMA models. Since it's a pure MA model, we can think of it as a linear filter with impulse response equal to the coefficients.

But the impulse response is the sequence \( \theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2, 0, 0, ... \), so the transfer function is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2}} \). So, the characteristic equation is \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \).

But again, substituting the given coefficients, we get \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, I must be missing something because the answer is given as D: 1 and -3, but according to my calculations, the roots are \( \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the characteristic roots of the associated AR process, but that would require a different equation.

Alternatively, maybe the given equation is a typo, and it was meant to be an AR process.

If it were an AR process, the equation would be \( y_t = \theta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t \). But the given equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which is an MA process.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the characteristic roots of the system's transfer function. But the transfer function for an MA process is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2}} \), whose poles are the roots of the denominator, which are \( \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). So, again, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrectly formulated.

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is a typo, and it's supposed to be \( y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), which would make the equation \( y_t = u_{t-2} - 3u_{t-1} + u_t \), same as before.

Wait, but in that case, it's just a reorder of the terms.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the equation as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), but it should be \( y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), which is the same thing.

Wait, so if the equation is \( y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), then it's the same as \( y_t = u_t - 3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange it as \( y_t - u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = -3u_t \). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the characteristic equation is written as \( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \), which would have roots 1 and -3.

So, solving \( -z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \implies z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \), which has roots \( z = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \), which are approximately 3.302 and -0.302.

But that's not matching 1 and -3 either.

Wait, another approach: Suppose we have an MA(1) process, what would be the characteristic equation?

It would be \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} = 0 \), so roots at z = 1/θ1.

If MA(2), then \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} = 0 \), which is quadratic.

But in the given options, D is 1 and -3, which are roots of \( z^2 + 3z - 1 = 0 \), because plugging in z = 1: 1 + 3 - 1 = 3 ≠ 0; z = -3: 9 - 9 -1 = -1 ≠ 0. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the equation is \( z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \), roots are 1 and -3? Wait, plugging z=1: 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 ≠ 0. Plugging z=-3: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 ≠ 0. So, that's not it either.

Wait, so z=1: 1 + 3(1) + 1 = 5 ≠ 0. z=-3: 9 - 9 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0. So, neither is a root.

Therefore, unless the characteristic equation is incorrectly written in the question, the options don't match the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is actually a different process, like an AR process.

Wait, suppose the process is AR(2): \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + u_t \). Then, the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3z^{-1} = 0 \implies z + 1 = 0 \implies z = -1 \). But that's only one root, but AR(2) would have two roots.

Alternatively, if it's AR(2): \( y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t \). Then, the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0 \implies z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \), same as before.

But that still doesn't give roots 1 and -3.

Wait, hold on. Let me try setting up a quadratic equation which has roots 1 and -3. So, the characteristic equation would be \( (z - 1)(z + 3) = z^2 + 2z - 3 = 0 \). But in our case, we have \( z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, unless the process is modeled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the AR representation of the MA process.

Wait, if we have an MA process, we can convert it into an equivalent AR representation. So, perhaps that's it.

Let me recall that for an MA(d) process, it can be expressed as an AR(d) process by using the relation \( y_t - \theta_1 y_{t-1} - ... - \theta_d y_{t-d} = u_t \). So, to get the AR representation, we can write:

\( y_t - \theta_1 y_{t-1} - ... - \theta_d y_{t-d} = u_t \)

In our case, the MA process is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, the AR representation would be:

\( y_t - (-3)y_{t-1} - 1 y_{t-2} = u_t \implies y_t + 3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} = u_t \)

Wait, no, the AR representation for an MA process is:

\( y_t - \theta_1 y_{t-1} - ... - \theta_d y_{t-d} = u_t \)

But in our case, we have:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \implies y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But that's not directly an AR process because y_t is on the left, and u's are on the right.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express y_t in terms of previous y
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The question is:

"The characteristic roots of the MA process

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

are. The options are: A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3. Why the correct answer is: D. 1 and -3?"

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out why the correct answer is D, which claims the roots are 1 and -3. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is derived from the recurrence relation. In general, an MA process has the form:

$y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i u_{t-i}$

where $u_t$ is the white noise sequence, and $q$ is the order of the MA process. In this case, looking at the given equation:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

It seems that the coefficients are -3 for $u_{t-1}$, 1 for $u_{t-2}$, and 1 for $u_t$. Wait, hold on, that seems a bit odd because typically, in an MA process, the lags go from $t-1$ down to $t-q$ and the coefficients correspond to $\theta_i$.

But here, the equation is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Hmm, so the lags are t-1, t-2, and t? That might imply that the process is actually of order 3, but I need to check.

Wait, no. Let me think. In an MA(q) process, the maximum lag is t-1 down to t-q, so the equation should have terms from t-1 to t-q. Here, the equation has u_t, which is a lag of 0, u_{t-1}, which is lag 1, and u_{t-2}, which is lag 2. So that would mean the process is MA(3). Is that correct?

Wait, but the standard form is:

$y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q}$

So, if we have a term u_t, which is a lag of 0, that would imply that the process is actually of order q=3 because the highest lag is t-1, t-2, and t, which is like q=3. But wait, actually, the u_t is equivalent to u_{t-0}, so perhaps the process is MA(3).

But in that case, the standard form is:

$y_t = \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} + \theta_3 u_{t-3}$

Comparing that to our equation:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Wait, but that would mean that u_t is equivalent to u_{t-0}, which is present in the equation, but in the standard MA(q) form, the highest lag is t-1. So, perhaps there is a typo in the problem? Or perhaps the person writing it just included u_t with a coefficient 1, but in reality, is that even possible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe it's a difference equation. Let me try to convert the given recurrence into a standard form.

Given:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Let me bring all terms to the left-hand side:

$y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

So, the equation becomes:

$y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

But in an MA process, the equation is homogeneous, so if we set y_t to zero, we get:

$-u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

Which is:

$-u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

Or, rearranged:

$u_t = 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}$

Wait, that seems to be a recurrence relation for the noise process u_t.

So, the characteristic equation would be obtained by replacing u_t with r^t:

$r^t = 3r^{t-1} - r^{t-2}$

Divide both sides by r^{t-2}:

$r^2 = 3r - 1$

So, the characteristic equation is:

$r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0$

Now, to find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:

$r = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$

Wait, that would mean the roots are $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ and $(3 - \sqrt{5})/2$, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, neither of which is 1 or -3.

Hmm, but the given correct answer is D, 1 and -3. That doesn't align with what I just calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in forming the characteristic equation.

Let me go back. The original equation is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

If we set y_t to zero, the recurrence for u_t is:

$-u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0$

Which is:

$u_t = 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}$

So, I think that's correct.

Therefore, the characteristic equation is as I wrote:

$r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0$

Which gives roots:

$r = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 4)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)] / 2 ≈ 2.618 and 0.382$

But the answer given is 1 and -3, which suggests that the characteristic equation is different.

So, perhaps I misinterpreted the equation. Let me check the original problem again.

It says: y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

Wait, is this correct? Because usually, in an MA(q) process, the highest lag is t-1, so if we have a u_t term, that would suggest a lag of 0, making it a non-standard form, perhaps a mix of MA and something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the equation should have u_{t+1} instead of u_t? That would make more sense because otherwise, the equation isn't an MA process.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is correct, and the question is expecting me to consider it as a mixed model?

Wait, if the equation is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, then is u_t a lag of +1? Because if u_t is u_{t-(-1)}, which would be a forward lag of 1, that is, u_{t+1}?

Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is miswritten, and it should be y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would make it a standard MA(3) process.

But the equation given is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

Wait, this seems odd because normally, we don't have a term with u_t unless it's a different kind of process.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Suppose that perhaps the process is actually a mixed model or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the person who wrote this question intended it to be an AR process instead of an MA process? Because in AR processes, we have terms with y_{t-k} and u_t.

But the question says it's an MA process. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the equation in terms of u_{t} and its lags.

So, the given is:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

If I move y_t to the left side:

$y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0$

But in MA processes, the equation is expressed in terms of u's with positive lags, so u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, etc. So, having a u_t term complicates things because that's equivalent to u_{t-0}, which is just u_t.

Alternatively, maybe that's a typo, and it should be u_{t+1}, which would make it an AR process.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms:

Let me write the equation as:

$u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = y_t$

Which is similar to the standard MA form, but with u_t instead of u_{t-1}. Hmm, so the equation is:

$u_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + y_t$

Wait, no, that would imply that u_t is a function of y_t, which would not be a pure MA process. So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is correct, and we can consider it as a linear recurrence for y_t:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

But I don't think that's the standard approach. Maybe treating y_t as an output and u_t as noise, but in that case, it's more of an AR process.

Wait, perhaps I need to form the transfer function or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is written incorrectly, and the user meant to write the equation as:

$y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

Which would make it a standard MA(3) process. In that case, the characteristic equation would be:

$r^3 = -3r^2 + r$

Bringing all terms to the left:

$r^3 + 3r^2 - r = 0$

Factor out an r:

$r(r^2 + 3r - 1) = 0$

So, the roots would be r = 0 and the roots of r^2 + 3r -1 = 0, which are:

$r = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 4)] / 2 = [-3 ± sqrt(13)] / 2 ≈ (-3 ± 3.605)/2$

So, approximately, 0.605 and -3.0. Wait, one of the roots would be approximately -3.0, which is one of the options. So in that case, if the process was written as y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, then the characteristic equation would have roots at 0, approximately 0.605, and -3.

But the given correct answer is D: 1 and -3. So, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, going back to the original question:

"The characteristic roots of the MA process

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

are. The options are: A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3. Why the correct answer is: D. 1 and -3?"

So, the equation is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

So, perhaps I need to consider that u_t is u_{t} instead of u_{t-1}, which is confusing.

Wait, another approach: Maybe treat the equation as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence?

Wait, if y_t is the output, but in an MA process, y_t is just a function of the past noise terms. So, perhaps y_t is the observed process, and u_t is the noise. So, if we have y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, then we can write this as:

$u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}$

Wait, which is a different kind of model. Normally, in ARMA models, we have y_t = AR polynomial acting on y_{t-1}, ..., plus MA polynomial acting on u_t. But here, the equation is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

Hmm, which is mixing y_t with u_t terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it in terms of y_t and u_t:

$y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

Then, if we take the characteristic equation of the noise u_t, it should satisfy:

$r^t = u_t, r^{t-1}= u_{t-1}, r^{t-2}=u_{t-2}$

So, plugging into the equation:

$y_t = r^t - 3 r^{t-1} + r^{t-2}$

Divide both sides by r^{t-2}:

$\frac{y_t}{r^{t-2}} = r^2 - 3 r + 1$

But wait, in an ARMA model, the transfer function is Y(s) = (MA polynomial)(U(s)), so the characteristic equation is determined by the MA polynomial.

But in this case, the MA polynomial is 1 - 3 r^{-1} + r^{-2}, which is equivalent to r^2 - 3 r + 1.

So, again, characteristic equation is r^2 - 3 r + 1 = 0, which has roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which are not 1 and -3.

Hmm, this is confusing because the answer is given as 1 and -3.

Wait, let me try to see if I can manipulate the equation differently. Perhaps it's a typo and the person meant u_{t+1} instead of u_t? Because otherwise, I can't see how the roots would be 1 and -3.

Wait, if the equation was y_t = -3u_{t+1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, that would make more sense, but that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the characteristic equation for y_t. Since it's an MA process, the characteristic equation is the MA polynomial.

But in this case, the MA polynomial is 1 - 3 r^{-1} + r^{-2}, so when written in terms of r, it's r^2 - 3 r + 1, as above.

So, unless I made a mistake in forming the equation, the roots are (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 2.618 and (3 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.382.

But none of the options have these roots. The options are:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

So, none of these correspond to the roots we calculated.

Wait, perhaps I have misinterpreted the equation as an MA process when it's actually an AR process. Let me try that.

If it's an AR process, the equation would be:

$y_t = -3y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t$

But in the given equation, it's y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So, that's mixing y_t with u_t. So, that's not an AR process either.

Wait, perhaps it's a mix of AR and MA? But then, it's not clear.

Wait, maybe I need to write the system in state space form. Let me try that.

Assuming that y_t is the output, u_t is the noise, and we have the equation:

$y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t$

Let me write this as:

$y_t = u_t -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}$

So, the transfer function is Y(z) = (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z)

Thus, the system's transfer function is (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}), whose characteristic equation is:

$1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0$

Multiply both sides by z^2:

$z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0$

Which is the same equation as before, so the roots are (3 ± sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 2.618 and 0.382.

So again, same result.

Wait, so if I get that characteristic roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, but the correct answer is 1 and -3, that doesn't add up. So perhaps I have a fundamental misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the process for y_t, but considering y_t as a function of u_t.

Wait, if we consider y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, then we can write this as:

y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0

So, which is similar to a linear recurrence for y_t:

y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0

But this seems to mix y_t and u_t terms, which is not standard. Normally, in linear recursions, you have either y_t in terms of previous y's or u's, but not both.

Wait, maybe treating this as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, where y_t is a function of u_t, but then it's not an AR or MA model.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms to form a characteristic equation for y_t.

Wait, perhaps the process is written incorrectly, and instead of u_t, it should be u_{t-1} as well, making it y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_{t-3}, which would then be an MA(3) process with a characteristic equation r^3 - 3 r^2 + r = 0, which factors as r(r^2 - 3 r + 1) = 0, so roots at 0, (3 ± sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 2.618 and 0.382, which again does not include -3.

Alternatively, if the equation was y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + (-3)u_t, but that would be a different process.

Wait, maybe I should try to write the relation as a difference equation in terms of y_t:

Given y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

Let me consider the equation for u_t:

u_t = y_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Which is a non-homogeneous recurrence relation for u_t.

But in that case, the homogeneous part is u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = 0, which is the same as the previous characteristic equation with roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2.

But since the non-homogeneous term is y_t, which is a known function, perhaps we can solve the non-homogeneous recurrence.

Wait, but then again, the question is about characteristic roots of the MA process, so maybe I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, and the correct roots are indeed approximately 2.618 and 0.382, but that's not any of the options given. The given options are 1 and 2, 1 and 0.5, 2 and -0.5, or 1 and -3.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think about the process differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is talking about the characteristic roots of the process's generating function.

Given y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So, the generating function Y(z) = -3 z^{-1} U(z) + z^{-2} U(z) + z U(z)

So, Y(z) = (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z)

So, the transfer function is 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}, which is the same as before.

So, the characteristic equation is z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0, giving roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 2.618 and 0.382.

Thus, I still don't see how we get roots 1 and -3.

Wait, perhaps I can check if 1 is a root of the characteristic equation.

If I plug r = 1 into z^2 - 3 z + 1:

1 - 3 + 1 = -1 ≠ 0

So, 1 is not a root.

What about r = -3:

(-3)^2 - 3*(-3) + 1 = 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 ≠ 0

So, -3 is not a root either.

Wait, so neither 1 nor -3 satisfy the characteristic equation, meaning that the characteristic roots are not 1 and -3.

So, is there something wrong with my understanding? Because according to my calculations, the roots are (3 + sqrt(5))/2 and (3 - sqrt(5))/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

But the given correct answer is D, which claims the roots are 1 and -3.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me see: is the process an MA(1) or MA(2)?

Looking at the equation, y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So, we have lags of t-1, t-2, and t, which is like order 3, but as I saw earlier, that complicates things.

Wait, but if I think that u_t is actually a lag of 0, so the equation is:

y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_{t-0}

So, the process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

So, is this a standard MA process? Because in standard MA(q), we don't have u_t. So, perhaps the process is of order 3, but with a non-standard form.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the intended equation was y_t = -3u_{t} + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would be a standard MA(3) process.

In that case, the characteristic equation is r^3 + 3 r^2 - r = 0, as I saw earlier, which has roots at r = 0, ( -3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2 ≈ 0.605, and (-3 - sqrt(13))/2 ≈ -3.0.

Wait, so in that case, the roots are 0, approximately 0.605, and -3.0, which would correspond to option D: 1 and -3, but wait, 0 is also a root.

Hmm, but 0 is not in the options given. The options are 1 and -3. So, perhaps the process is written incorrectly, but if it's intended to have roots at 1 and -3, then the characteristic equation would be (r - 1)(r + 3) = r^2 + 2r - 3 = 0.

But in our case, the characteristic equation is r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0, which is different.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to something else.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Suppose that the characteristic equation has roots 1 and -3, so the equation would be (r - 1)(r + 3) = r^2 + 2r - 3 = 0.

But in our case, the characteristic equation is r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the roots are not 1 and -3, but something else.

Wait, maybe I can think of the process differently. Suppose that the process is a moving average where the coefficients are given, but written in a non-standard way.

Wait, is the equation y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is y_t = -3u_{t} + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which would be a standard MA(3) process.

In that case, characteristic equation is r^3 + 3 r^2 - r = 0, which has roots at 0, ( -3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2, and ( -3 - sqrt(13) ) / 2 ≈ -3.0.

So, in that case, the roots are approximately 0, 0.605, and -3.0.

But in the options, the only one that includes -3 is D: 1 and -3. So, if the equation was y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, the roots would be 1 and -3 if the characteristic equation was (r -1)(r +3)=0, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is talking about the poles of the transfer function instead of the characteristic roots. In that case, the transfer function is (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}), so the poles are at z = (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

So, again, those are not 1 or -3.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the process as a filter with poles at 1 and -3, but then the transfer function would be (1 - z + z^2), which corresponds to poles at z = 1 and z = -3. Let me check:

If the transfer function is (1 - z + z^2), then the characteristic equation is z^2 - z + 1 = 0, which has roots at (1 ± sqrt(-3))/2, which are complex numbers, not real numbers. So, that is not matching either.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the process in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as a difference equation for y_t, given the relation to u_t.

Wait, since y_t is expressed in terms of u_t and its lags, perhaps we can combine them.

Wait, so we have y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t

If I express this as:

y_t - u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = 0

But I don't know y_t is expressed as a function of both y and u terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's intended as an AR process.

Wait, but in that case, an AR process would have y_t expressed in terms of past y's and present u.

But here, it's expressed in terms of past u's and present u, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the process is written as y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is equivalent to y_t = (1)u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2}

So, in terms of the transfer function, it's (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z)

Therefore, the characteristic equation is 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0, which is z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0, as before.

Therefore, the characteristic roots are (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, which is approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

So, unless I've made a miscalculation, the roots are not 1 and -3.

Wait, could it be that the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the process for the noise u_t? But in that case, the process for u_t is the same as for y_t, since it's an MA process.

Wait, no, in an MA process, the noise u_t is unobserved, so we can't directly talk about its characteristic equation in the same way. The characteristic equation is usually associated with the transfer function or the AR part.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it: Maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the system's difference equation when it's written in terms of y_t and u_t.

But since y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, rearranged:

y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0

So, this is a linear recurrence involving y_t and u_t, but it's not a standard AR or MA model.

Wait, maybe treating this as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence for y_t, where the non-homogeneous term is u_t.

But in that case, the equation is:

y_t = u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2}

Which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence for y_t, with the homogeneous part being:

y_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = u_t

But this seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps solving the recurrence for y_t:

y_t - u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = 0

But without knowing the initial conditions or more information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is a miswritten version of an AR(1) process or something else.

Wait, perhaps an AR(1) process would be y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + u_t, which has characteristic equation r = -3, so root at -3.

But in that case, our process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is a combination of u's.

Alternatively, if it was y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, that's a standard MA(3) process with characteristic equation r^3 + 3r^2 - r = 0, which has roots at 0, ( -3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2 ≈ 0.605, and (-3 - sqrt(13))/2 ≈ -3.0.

So, in that case, one of the roots is -3, but the others are 0 and 0.605.

Wait, but in the options, only D includes -3, but also 1. However, 1 is not a root in that case.

Alternatively, if the process was y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + (-3)u_t, then the characteristic equation would be r^2 + 3r - 3 = 0, which gives roots ( -3 ± sqrt(9 + 12 ) ) / 2 = ( -3 ± sqrt(21) ) / 2 ≈ (-3 ± 4.583)/2, so approximately 0.791 and -3.791. Still not 1 and -3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the process as an MA(2) process, but then the equation would have only two terms, but in this case, it has three terms.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is talking about the characteristic equation in a different way, not considering the process itself but something else.

Wait, but I'm starting to think that the question might have a typo, or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the process as a mixed model.

Wait, a mixed model has both AR and MA components, but in this case, the equation is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which doesn't fit a mixed model.

Wait, unless we can write y_t = (1 + 3B)u_t + (-3B)u_{t-1} + B^2 u_{t-2}, where B is the backshift operator.

In that case, the transfer function is (1 + 3B - 3B^2). But in terms of the characteristic equation, it's 1 + 3r - 3r^2 = 0, which is -3r^2 + 3r + 1 = 0, or 3r^2 - 3r -1 = 0, which gives r = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 12)] / 6 = [3 ± sqrt(21)] /6 ≈ [3 ± 4.583]/6, so approximately 1.264 and -0.264.

Again, that's not matching the given options.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try another approach.

Suppose I assume that the characteristic roots are 1 and -3, as given in option D. Then, the characteristic equation would be (r - 1)(r + 3) = r^2 + 2r - 3 = 0.

But given that our process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, the characteristic equation is z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0, as before.

So, unless the process is written incorrectly, I can't see how the roots are 1 and -3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this process as a combination of two processes.

Wait, if y_t is a combination of a process with characteristic root 1 and another with characteristic root -3, then perhaps (1 + (-3)) or something like that, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the process is written incorrectly, and the correct equation is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + 1, which would be a non-homogeneous equation, but then the roots wouldn't be related.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the characteristic roots of the moving average polynomial, which is 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}, so the characteristic equation is z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0, with roots (3 ± sqrt(5))/2, as before.

Given that none of the options match, unless I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I can try solving the characteristic equation z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

z = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 4)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)] / 2 ≈ [3 ± 2.236]/2

So, approximately, z ≈ (5.236)/2 ≈ 2.618, and z ≈ (0.764)/2 ≈ 0.382.

So, neither of these is 1 or -3.

Wait, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, and the correct characteristic equation is different.

Wait, if the characteristic equation was z^2 + 2 z - 3 = 0, which factors as (z - 1)(z + 3) = 0, then roots are 1 and -3, which is option D.

But how does that relate to the given process?

Well, if the process had characteristic equation z^2 + 2 z - 3 = 0, then the transfer function would be (1 + 2 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-2}) or something like that.

Wait, let me see: If the transfer function is 1 + 2 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-2}, then the characteristic equation is 1 + 2 z^{-1} - 3 z^{-2} = 0

Multiply both sides by z^2:

z^2 + 2 z - 3 =
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The model given is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

The options are:
A. 1 and 2
B. 1 and 0.5
C. 2 and -0.5
D. 1 and -3

And the correct answer is said to be D. 1 and -3. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that for an MA process, the characteristic equation is derived from the relationship between the lagged terms of the error (u_t) and the current term. For an MA(q) model, the characteristic equation is a polynomial of degree q, where the coefficients correspond to the MA coefficients. In this case, the model is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing because typically, an MA(q) process is written as:

\( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

In this given model, the current term is \( u_t \), the immediate past is \( u_{t-1} \), and the second past is \( u_{t-2} \). So, it looks like this is an MA(3) process because there are terms up to \( u_{t-2} \).

So, the characteristic equation would be:

\( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - \theta_3 z^{-3} = 0 \)

But wait, in the given model, \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), so substituting the coefficients:

\( 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} - 1 z^{-3} = 0 \)

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

In general, for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \dots - \theta_q z^{-q} = 0 \)

But in the standard form, the MA(q) model is:

\( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

So in our given model, \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). Comparing this to the standard form, the coefficients are:

- \( \theta_0 = 1 \) (coefficient of \( u_t \))
- \( \theta_1 = -3 \) (coefficient of \( u_{t-1} \))
- \( \theta_2 = 1 \) (coefficient of \( u_{t-2} \))

So the characteristic equation should be:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \theta_2 z^{-3} = 0 \)

Wait, no, hold on. For the standard MA(q) model, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \dots - \theta_q z^{-q} = 0 \)

So in this case, our model has:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \).

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - 1 z^{-1} - (-3) z^{-2} - 1 z^{-3} = 0 \)

Simplifying that:

\( 1 - z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} - z^{-3} = 0 \)

But to make it easier, I can multiply both sides by \( z^3 \) to eliminate the negative exponents:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation is:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Now, to find the characteristic roots, I need to solve this cubic equation:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Hmm, solving a cubic might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can factor it. Let me try possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (1) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1), so possible roots are ±1.

Let me test z = 1:

\( 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 = 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 = 2 \neq 0 \)

So, z=1 is not a root.

What about z = -1:

\( (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 1 = -1 - 1 - 3 - 1 = -6 \neq 0 \)

So, z=-1 is also not a root.

Hmm, so it doesn't factor easily with rational roots. Maybe I need to factor it by grouping or use the cubic formula, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the characteristic equation as:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Let me consider that this is similar to expanding \( (z - a)^3 = z^3 - 3a z^2 + 3a^2 z - a^3 \). If I can express my equation in terms of that.

Comparing coefficients:

- Coefficient of \( z^2 \): -1 vs -3a
- Coefficient of z: 3 vs 3a^2
- Constant term: -1 vs -a^3

So, let's see:

From the coefficient of \( z^2 \):

-1 = -3a ⇒ a = 1/3

Then, check the coefficient of z:

3 = 3a² ⇒ a² = 1 ⇒ a = ±1

But from above, a = 1/3, which is not equal to 1 or -1. So that doesn't hold. So maybe it's not a perfect cube.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in setting up the characteristic equation.

Wait, let me double-check the setup.

Given the MA model:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, in standard MA(q) form, this is:

\( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \)

Where \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \).

The characteristic equation is then:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \theta_2 z^{-3} = 0 \)

Substituting the values:

\( 1 - 1 \cdot z^{-1} - (-3) z^{-2} - 1 \cdot z^{-3} = 0 \)

Which is:

\( 1 - z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} - z^{-3} = 0 \)

Multiplying both sides by \( z^3 \):

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Yes, that seems correct.

So, since it's a cubic equation and we can't factor it easily, maybe I can use the depressed cubic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution or another method.

Alternatively, since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can test the given options to see which roots satisfy the equation.

The options given are:

A. 1 and 2

B. 1 and 0.5

C. 2 and -0.5

D. 1 and -3

Wait, but the characteristic equation is a cubic, so it should have three roots. So, perhaps one of the roots is 1, and the others are as given in the options.

Let me test z=1:

\( 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 = 2 \neq 0 \)

So z=1 is not a root, as we saw before. Therefore, option D is saying that 1 is a root, which seems incorrect. But the given answer is D. Hmm, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I miswrote the characteristic equation. Let me think again.

In the MA model, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \theta_2 z^{-3} = 0 \)

But perhaps another way to think about it is that the transfer function is:

\( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - \theta_3 z^{-3}} \)

Wait, no, that's for ARIMA models. For pure MA(q), the transfer function is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \dots - \theta_q z^{-q}} \). So the characteristic equation is indeed \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \dots - \theta_q z^{-q} = 0 \).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check.

In the given model, \( y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, comparing to the standard MA(q) form:

\( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \theta_2 u_{t-2} \)

So, \( \theta_0 = 1 \), \( \theta_1 = -3 \), \( \theta_2 = 1 \). Therefore, the characteristic equation should be:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - \theta_2 z^{-3} = 0 \)

Substituting:

\( 1 - 1 \cdot z^{-1} - (-3) z^{-2} - 1 \cdot z^{-3} = 0 \)

Which is:

\( 1 - z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} - z^{-3} = 0 \)

Multiplying by \( z^3 \):

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Yes, that's the same as before.

So, if I can't factor it easily, maybe I should use the cubic formula or look for complex roots.

Alternatively, maybe approximate the roots or consider that one of them is 1, but z=1 wasn't a root.

Wait, perhaps I can graph the function \( f(z) = z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 \) and see where it crosses zero.

At z=0, f(z) = -1.

At z=1, f(z)=1 -1 +3 -1=2.

At z=0.5, f(z)=0.125 - 0.25 + 1.5 -1=0.375.

At z=-1, f(z)=-1 -1 -3 -1=-6.

So, between z=0.5 and z=1, it goes from 0.375 to 2, which doesn't cross zero. Between z=0 and z=0.5, it goes from -1 to 0.375, so it crosses zero somewhere between 0 and 0.5.

Similarly, for negative z:

At z approaching -infty, f(z) approaches -infty.

At z=0, f(z)=-1.

At z=1, f(z)=2.

So, it must cross zero somewhere between z negative infinity and z=0? Wait, but z= -1 is -6, z=0 is -1, so it's still negative. So, maybe only one real root between 0 and 0.5, and two complex roots.

Hmm, so given that, how can the options have real roots? The options are all real roots: A. 1 and 2; B.1 and 0.5; C.2 and -0.5; D.1 and -3.

Wait a minute, but if our characteristic equation is a cubic with one real root and two complex roots, then how can the options have two roots? That seems contradictory. Maybe I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, hold on, perhaps the model is actually an ARMA model? Because if it's just a pure MA model, then the characteristic equation is a cubic, but if it's an ARMA(p, q), then the characteristic equation is of degree p+q, and we can have both real and complex roots.

Wait, but the question specifies it's an MA process. So, perhaps it's a misstatement, or maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, in the given model, y_t is expressed in terms of u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, and u_t. So, is this an AR process or an MA process?

Wait, in AR processes, we have y_t as a linear combination of past y's, in MA processes, it's a linear combination of past u's. Here, y_t is expressed in terms of u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, which would make it an MA(3) because it's a linear combination of the last three u's.

But if I have an MA(3), then the characteristic equation is indeed a cubic, as we have.

But the options given in the question are pairs of roots, suggesting two roots, which is confusing because a cubic should have three roots.

Alternatively, maybe it's an AR process, but no, in the given equation, y_t is expressed in terms of u's, which would suggest it's an MA process.

Wait, perhaps the model is written incorrectly. Let me check:

The model given is:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Which can be rewritten as:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, it's an MA(3) process because it's a linear combination of up to u_{t-2}.

So, the characteristic equation is a cubic which we found as:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

But since none of the given options have three roots, but only two, maybe the question has a typo or perhaps it's considering only the non-zero roots or something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic equation's reciprocal roots or something else.

Wait, no, the characteristic roots are the roots of the characteristic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are the roots of the numerator when expressing the transfer function.

Wait, in an MA(q) process, the transfer function is \( \frac{1}{1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - \theta_3 z^{-3}} \). So, the characteristic equation is the denominator, which is a cubic, whose roots are the reciprocals of the poles of the transfer function. So, the characteristic roots are the same as the poles of the transfer function.

If the transfer function has poles at certain points, the characteristic equation's roots are the reciprocals of these poles.

But perhaps this is complicating things.

Alternatively, let me think differently. Maybe the question is about the characteristic equation of the associated AR process or something else.

Wait, but the given model is an MA(3) process, so unless there is an AR component, which there isn't.

Wait, maybe we can write the model as a state-space equation and find the eigenvalues, which would be the characteristic roots.

But that might be overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, maybe the question is wrong or has an error. Because given the characteristic equation is a cubic with one real root and two complex roots, but none of the options have three roots or include complex roots.

Wait, but the given answer is D: 1 and -3, but from earlier, z=1 isn't a root. Unless I made a mistake in the characteristic equation.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I misread the model.

Wait, the model is written as:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Is that supposed to be \( y_t = -3u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)?

No, it's written as \( -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), so the current term is u_t, with coefficients -3 for u_{t-1}, 1 for u_{t-2}, and 1 for u_t.

So, in terms of the transfer function, it's similar to an MA(3) process.

Alternatively, maybe it's actually an AR process, but in that case, the model would be written with y_t in terms of past y's.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect? Or maybe there is a misinterpretation.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with ARMA models, we can write the characteristic equation by combining AR and MA parts.

But in this case, the model is purely MA, so I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the AR part if it's written in AR form, but since it's an MA model, I don't think so.

Wait, maybe I should look for another way to express it.

Wait, perhaps if I consider the model as a recurrence relation.

Given that:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the homogeneous recurrence relation is:

\( y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0 \)

Wait, not quite. Let me rearrange the terms:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, moving all terms to the left-hand side:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Hmm, but that doesn't seem particularly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:

\( y_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} - u_t = 0 \)

But I don't know if that's useful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a system of equations.

Let me define the state vector as \( \mathbf{X}_t = [y_t, u_t, u_{t-1}]^T \). Then, we can write the state equations.

Given \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), and \( u_t \) is the input, so we have:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, in terms of state variables:

- \( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)
- \( u_t = u_t \)
- \( u_{t-1} = u_{t-1} \)

Wait, that's a bit redundant. Alternatively, since we have a third-order MA, maybe we can write a third-order state.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the characteristic equation of the MA process, which is a cubic, but since the question is only giving two options, perhaps it's only considering the non-zero roots or something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the characteristic equation can be factored into (z - 1)(z + 3) = z^2 + 2 z - 3, but that's not matching the cubic equation.

Wait, let me test that. Suppose the characteristic equation is:

\( (z - 1)(z + 3) = z^2 + 2 z - 3 \)

But our cubic equation is:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

So, unless we have another factor, like (z - a), such that:

\( (z - 1)(z + 3)(z - a) = 0 \)

Expanding this:

\( z^3 + ( -a + 2 ) z^2 + (3 - a) z - 3 a = 0 \)

Comparing with our original equation:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

So, we have:

- Coefficient of z^3: 1 (matches)
- Coefficient of z^2: (-a + 2) = -1 ⇒ -a + 2 = -1 ⇒ -a = -3 ⇒ a = 3
- Coefficient of z: (3 - a) = 3 ⇒ 3 - a = 3 ⇒ a = 0
- Constant term: -3a = -1 ⇒ a = 1/3

But that's inconsistent because a cannot be both 3 and 0 and 1/3.

Therefore, the characteristic equation cannot be factored as (z - 1)(z + 3)(z - a). So, that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps someone thought that the characteristic equation is quadratic? But that can't be because the model is MA(3), so the characteristic equation must be cubic.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the characteristic equation of the AR part? But since this is an MA process, it doesn't have an AR part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the process when expressed differently.

Wait, maybe we can consider that the model is equivalent to an AR process by using the method of undetermined coefficients or by solving for y_t.

Wait, let me try that. Let me suppose that y_t satisfies a linear recurrence relation.

Given:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

If I consider this as a recurrence for y_t in terms of past u's, but unless we have a relationship between y_t and y_{t-1}, etc., it's not directly a linear recurrence in y.

Alternatively, since u_t is a white noise process, perhaps the transfer function is \( Y(z) = \frac{U(z)}{1 - (-3) z^{-1} + z^{-2}} \), but that seems like an ARMA(0,3) model.

Wait, no, in that case, Y(z) = U(z) * [1 / (1 - (-3) z^{-1} + z^{-2})], which is an MA(2) process because the denominator is 1 - (-3) z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 1 + 3 z + z^2, which is an AR(2) polynomial.

So, in that case, the model is ARMA(2,1). Hmm, that's a different structure.

Wait, maybe the question is about the AR part, which is AR(2):

\( 1 + 3 z + z^2 = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation for the AR part is \( 1 + 3 z + z^2 = 0 \), whose roots are complex:

\( z = \frac{ -3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4} }{2} = \frac{ -3 \pm \sqrt{5} }{2} \)

But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the process as if it's a difference equation in y_t.

But since y_t is expressed in terms of u's, which are not necessarily lagged y's, it's not straightforward.

Wait, let me think about the difference equation approach.

Suppose we treat y_t as a linear combination of the previous y's, but in this model, it's a linear combination of u's. Unless we can write a relationship between y_t and y_{t-1}, etc., which isn't directly given.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to assume that the process is an ARMA(1,2) or something else.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should just go back to the original model.

We have an MA(3) process:

\( y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

The characteristic equation is:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Given that none of the roots seem to be 1 or -3, but the answer is given as D: 1 and -3.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the roots of the reversed characteristic equation?

Wait, sometimes, the characteristic equation is written as \( 1 - \theta_1 z^{-1} - \theta_2 z^{-2} - \theta_3 z^{-3} = 0 \), which is equivalent to \( z^3 - \theta_1 z^2 - \theta_2 z - \theta_3 = 0 \) after multiplying by z^3.

But in our case, the characteristic equation is \( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \). So, the coefficients are 1, -1, 3, -1.

Alternatively, perhaps someone confused the order of coefficients. Maybe they thought the characteristic equation is \( z^3 - (-3) z^2 + 1 z - 1 = z^3 + 3 z^2 + z - 1 =0 \), but that's not the case.

Wait, let's check.

If someone incorrectly wrote the characteristic equation, thinking that the coefficients are ordered as u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, so theta_0=1, theta_1=-3, theta_2=1.

But I think the process is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is confusing the characteristic equation with the numerator or denominator of the transfer function.

Wait, the transfer function is \( \frac{1}{1 - (-3) z^{-1} + z^{-2}} = \frac{1}{1 + 3 z + z^2} \), so the poles are at the roots of the denominator, which is \( 1 + 3 z + z^2 =0 \), whose roots are complex.

Alternatively, the characteristic equation is \( 1 + 3 z + z^2 =0 \), but that's a quadratic, which doesn't match the given cubic.

Wait, no, the characteristic equation is for the MA part, which is a cubic. So, the confusion must be somewhere else.

Wait, let me take a step back. The question is about the characteristic roots of the MA process. So, the answer options are all pairs of roots, but in reality, a cubic equation should have three roots. So, perhaps the question is incorrect or incomplete.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the characteristic equation of the AR part of an ARMA model, but in this case, it's purely MA(3).

Wait, unless it's a misprint, and the model is actually AR(2). Let me check:

If it were an AR(2) model, the characteristic equation would be quadratic. So, if y_t = y_{t-1} + 3 y_{t-2}, then the characteristic equation is z^2 - z -3 =0, whose roots are z=(1±sqrt(13))/2, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, maybe the model was meant to be y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t, making it an ARMA(2,1). Then, the characteristic equation is the AR part: z^2 + 3 z -1=0, but that's not matching either.

Wait, another idea: maybe the question is referring to the characteristic equation in terms of the process itself. For example, for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is 1 - sum_{i=1}^q theta_i z^{-i}=0, but in our case, it's 1 - z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} - z^{-3}=0.

Wait, if we multiply by z^3 to get z^3 - z^2 + 3 z -1=0, as we did before.

So, unless someone incorrectly factors this equation as (z -1)(z + 3)(something)=0, but as I saw before, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps someone thought that the characteristic equation is formed by writing y_t = (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) u_t, so the characteristic equation is 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0, which is quadratic:

\( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}=0 \)

Multiplying by z^2:

\( z^2 - 3 z +1=0 \)

Which has roots:

\( z = [3 ± sqrt(9 -4)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)] / 2 \), which is approximately 2.618 and 0.381, which are not the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question confused the characteristic equation with the recurrence relation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the characteristic equation of the AR part if we somehow express the MA process as an AR process.

But I don't see how, unless I have a feedback mechanism.

Wait, let me consider writing this as a linear recurrence for y_t.

Given that y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, but since u_t is a white noise process, unless we have a relationship between y_t and y_{t-1}, etc., which we don't, we can't directly write a linear recurrence for y_t.

Therefore, without a feedback mechanism, we can't have an AR part, so it's purely MA.

Therefore, the characteristic equation is a cubic, and the roots are one real and two complex, or all real? Wait, earlier analysis showed that it crosses zero once between 0 and 0.5, and no real roots elsewhere, so likely one real and two complex.

But the options don't have complex roots, so maybe the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the non-zero roots or something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is from a different source, and the model is actually something else.

Wait, perhaps the model is y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t, which would be an ARMA(2,1) model, and then the characteristic equation is the AR part.

But in that case, the characteristic equation would be z^2 +3 z -1=0, whose roots are complex, as above.

Alternatively, if it's y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, so it's an MA(3) model.

Given that, the characteristic equation is a cubic with one real root and two complex roots, as above.

But if the given answer is D: 1 and -3, which are both real roots, but our analysis shows that z=1 is not a root, since f(1)=2, not zero.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo in the model.

Wait, if the model was instead y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t, then it's an ARMA(2,1) model, and the characteristic equation would be z^2 + 3 z -1=0, whose roots are complex, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is y_t = -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is similar to what we have.

Wait, that would be y_t = u_t -3 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} = -2 u_t + u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}. Hmm, but that's different from the original.

Wait, no, original is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So, it's y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

If I write this as y_t +3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = u_t.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing in terms of y_{t-1} or something.

Wait, I think I need to accept that maybe the question is incorrect or that there is a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formation of the characteristic equation.

Wait, going back: for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is 1 - sum_{i=1}^q theta_i z^{-i}=0.

In our case, theta_1 = -3, theta_2=1, theta_3=1.

Therefore, characteristic equation is 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} - 1 z^{-3}=0.

Wait, no, that would be:

1 + 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} + z^{-3}=0.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the standard MA(q) model, it's:

\( y_t = \theta_0 u_t + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q u_{t-q} \)

Thus, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - \theta_0 z^{-1} - \theta_1 z^{-2} - ... - \theta_q z^{-q} = 0 \)

Therefore, for our model:

\( y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, theta_0=1, theta_1=-3, theta_2=1.

Thus, the characteristic equation is:

\( 1 - 1 \cdot z^{-1} - (-3) z^{-2} - 1 \cdot z^{-3} = 0 \)

Simplifying:

\( 1 - z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} - z^{-3} = 0 \)

Multiplying by z^3:

\( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z -1 =0 \)

Yes, that's correct.

So, if none of the options correspond to this cubic, and given that the answer is D:1 and -3, perhaps the question is incorrect or there is a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the reciprocal of the characteristic equation.

Wait, the characteristic polynomial is \( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z -1=0 \). Its reciprocal polynomial would be \( z^3 - z^2 + 3 z -1 \), same as original. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the characteristic equation is \( z^3 - (-3) z^2 + 1 z -1= z^3 +3 z^2 + z -1=0 \), which is incorrect.

Wait, let me test that. If someone incorrectly wrote the characteristic equation as:

\( z^3 - (-3) z^2 + 1 z -1=0 \), which is z^3 +3 z^2 + z -1=0.

Roots can be found numerically. Let's see:

Testing z=1: 1 +3 +1 -1=4≠0

z=-1: -1 +3 -1 -1=0

Wait, z=-1 is a root.

Then, factoring out (z +1):

Using polynomial division:

Divide z^3 +3 z^2 + z -1 by (z +1):

- Coefficients: 1 | 3 | 1 | -1

Bring down 1.

Multiply by -1: -1

Add to next coefficient: 3 + (-1)=2

Multiply by -1: -2

Add to next coefficient:1 + (-2)= -1

Multiply by -1:1

Add to last coefficient: -1 +1=0

So, the quotient is z^2 +2 z -1.

Thus, the characteristic equation factors as (z +1)(z^2 +2 z -1)=0.

Therefore, roots are z=-1, and roots of z^2 +2 z -1=0, which are z = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +4)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = (-2 ± 2*sqrt(2))/2 = -1 ± sqrt(2).

So, the roots are approximately -1 +1.414
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about the characteristic roots of a moving average (MA) process. The given recursion is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). The options are A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, and D. 1 and -3. The correct answer is D, but I want to understand why.

First, I need to recall what characteristic roots mean in the context of an MA process. I remember that an MA process has a characteristic equation, similar to AR processes. For an MA(q) model, the characteristic equation is obtained by setting the numerator of the transfer function equal to zero. The transfer function for an MA(q) model is \( B(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 - \dots - \phi_q z^q \), where the \( \phi_i \) are the coefficients from the MA recursion.

Given the MA process here, it's written as \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, comparing this to the general form \( y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i} \), I see that the coefficients are \( \phi_1 = 1 \), \( \phi_2 = -3 \), and \( \phi_3 = 1 \)? Wait, hold on, the given equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, that's \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, the coefficients are \( \phi_1 = -3 \) for \( u_{t-1} \) and \( \phi_2 = 1 \) for \( u_{t-2} \). Wait, but usually, the MA coefficients are written in decreasing powers of lag. So, is it \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \), which would imply that the coefficients are \( \phi_1 = 1 \), \( \phi_2 = -3 \), and \( \phi_3 = 1 \)? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, maybe not. In the standard MA(q) model, the recursion is \( y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i} \). So, in this case, the given recursion is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, that would imply that \( \phi_1 = 1 \), \( \phi_2 = -3 \), and \( \phi_3 = 1 \)? But wait, in an MA(q) process, the highest lag is q, so if we have up to \( u_{t-2} \), that would mean q=2? Wait, but here, we have \( y_t \) expressed in terms of \( u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2} \). So, is q=3? Because the highest lag is t-2, which is lag 2, but the current term is t, which is lag 0. Hmm, no, the lag of t is 0, so the lag order would be 0,1,2. So, is the process MA(3)? Because it goes up to \( u_{t-2} \), which is lag 2.

Wait, but no, actually, in the standard notation, an MA(q) process has the highest lag of q. So, if we have terms up to \( u_{t-2} \), then q=2. But in the given equation, we have \( u_t \) as well, which is lag 0. So, actually, it's:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the coefficients are:

- For \( u_t \) (lag 0): coefficient is 1
- For \( u_{t-1} \) (lag 1): coefficient is -3
- For \( u_{t-2} \) (lag 2): coefficient is 1

So, therefore, this is an MA(2) process because the highest lag is 2. Wait, but the coefficient for lag 0 is non-zero, which is 1. So, in the transfer function, it's \( B(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 \). So, plugging in the coefficients:

\( B(z) = 1 - (-3)z - 1 z^2 = 1 + 3z - z^2 \).

Wait, no. Hold on, in the standard transfer function for MA(q), it's \( B(z) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i z^i \). So, in this case, \( \phi_1 = -3 \), \( \phi_2 = 1 \). So:

\( B(z) = 1 - (-3)z - 1 z^2 = 1 + 3z - z^2 \).

So, to find the characteristic roots, we set \( B(z) = 0 \):

\( 1 + 3z - z^2 = 0 \)

Let me rearrange that:

\( -z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \)

Multiplying both sides by -1 to make it standard quadratic:

\( z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \)

So, solving for z:

Using the quadratic formula, \( z = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \)

Wait, but that would give complex roots, but the answer is supposed to be real roots: 1 and -3.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in defining the transfer function. Maybe I need to consider the order differently.

Wait, let me step back. Perhaps the given equation is written in a different way. The equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, that's \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, in terms of lags, that's:

- \( y_t = (1)u_t + (-3)u_{t-1} + (1)u_{t-2} \)

So, to form the characteristic equation, we need to write:

\( 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 = 0 \). Wait, no, for the transfer function, it's \( 1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 \). But in our case, the coefficients are:

\( \phi_1 = -3 \), \( \phi_2 = 1 \). So, yes, \( B(z) = 1 - (-3)z - 1 z^2 = 1 + 3z - z^2 \).

So, the characteristic equation is \( -z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 \) or \( z^2 - 3z - 1 = 0 \). So, the roots are \( [3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \). But that doesn't match the answer, which is 1 and -3.

Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere. Maybe my understanding of the MA process is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the given equation is written in a different form.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as a homogeneous linear recurrence relation and find its characteristic equation.

Given the recurrence: \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Wait, is that the case? So, \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, to express this as a linear recurrence, maybe we can write it as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

So, the characteristic equation is obtained by replacing \( y_t \) with \( z^t \), \( u_{t-1} \) with \( z^{t-1} \), and \( u_{t-2} \) with \( z^{t-2} \).

So, substituting:

\( z^t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

But since all the \( u \)s are multiplied by z^{-1} to make it a function of z. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the transfer function.

Alternatively, let's write the recurrence as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Expressed in terms of z-transforms, we get:

\( z^t y(t) - z^t u(t) + 3 z^{t-1} u(t-1) - z^{t-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

Dividing both sides by \( z^t \):

\( y(t) - u(t) + 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) - z^{-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

So, the transfer function is:

\( Y(z) = \frac{1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1} \)

Wait, no, the transfer function relates Y(z) to U(z). So, from the above equation:

\( Y(z) - U(z) + 3 z^{-1} U(z) - z^{-2} U(z) = 0 \)

So, grouping Y(z):

\( Y(z) = U(z) - 3 z^{-1} U(z) + z^{-2} U(z) \)

Thus, \( Y(z) = \left(1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}\right) U(z) \)

Therefore, the transfer function is \( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), which can be written as \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 \).

Ah! So, the characteristic polynomial is \( z^2 - 3z + 1 \), because in the transfer function, to find the characteristic equation, we set the numerator equal to zero, but in this case, since it's a one-pole-one-zero structure, the numerator is the characteristic polynomial.

Wait, no. For the transfer function of an MA process, it's \( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i z^{-i} \). So, in this case, \( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \). So, multiplying numerator and denominator by \( z^2 \) to eliminate the negatives, we get:

\( Y(z) = \frac{z^2 - 3 z + 1}{z^2} U(z) \)

Therefore, the numerator is the characteristic polynomial \( z^2 - 3z + 1 \). So, the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, but earlier when I set \( B(z) = 0 \), I got a different equation. Maybe I was confused about the direction of the transfer function.

Wait, no, the transfer function is \( Y(z)/U(z) = 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), which is the same as \( \frac{z^2 - 3 z + 1}{z^2} \). So, setting the numerator equal to zero gives the characteristic equation: \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \). So, solving this quadratic:

\( z = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}]/2 = [3 \pm \sqrt{5}]/2 \)

Wait, now I'm confused again because the square root of 5 is about 2.236, so roots would be approximately (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618 and (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.382. So, approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which are reciprocals.

But the supposed answer is 1 and -3, which are roots of \( z^2 - 4z + 1 = 0 \). Wait, 1 and -3 are roots of \( z^2 + 3z - 1 = 0 \). Hmm, that doesn't align with what I've derived.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the transfer function. Let's go back.

Given the recurrence:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Which can be rewritten as:

\( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \)

So, the transfer function is \( Y(z) = (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z) \), same as before.

But if we rearrange the equation, we have:

\( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Expressed in z-transforms:

\( z^t y(t) - z^t u(t) + 3 z^{t-1} u(t-1) - z^{t-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

Divide by \( z^t \):

\( y(t) - u(t) + 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) - z^{-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

Then, solving for Y(z):

\( Y(z) = 1 \cdot U(z) - 3 z^{-1} U(z) + z^{-2} U(z) \)

Thus, \( Y(z) = \left(1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}\right) U(z) \), which is the same as before. So, the numerator is \( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), so the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \).

Hmm, so then why is the supposed answer 1 and -3? Because 1 and -3 are roots of \( z^2 - 4z + 1 = 0 \). Wait, that's not consistent.

Wait, maybe I have the direction of the transfer function reversed? If I think of it as a system, sometimes it's written as \( Y(z) = B(z) U(z) \), but sometimes it's \( U(z) = B(z) Y(z) \).

Looking back at the equation:

The original equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

So, rearranged as:

\( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

Expressed in z-transforms:

\( z^t y(t) - z^t u(t) + 3 z^{t-1} u(t-1) - z^{t-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

Divide by \( z^t \):

\( y(t) - u(t) + 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) - z^{-2} u(t-2) = 0 \)

Then, moving terms:

\( y(t) = u(t) - 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) + z^{-2} u(t-2) \)

So, \( Y(z) = \left(1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}\right) U(z) \)

Therefore, \( Y(z) = (1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2}) U(z) \), so the transfer function is indeed \( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \). Therefore, the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \), with roots \( [3 \pm \sqrt{5}]/2 \). So, around 2.618 and 0.382.

But the answer given is 1 and -3. So, perhaps the question was phrased incorrectly? Or maybe I misread the original recursion.

Wait, let me double-check the original question. It says: "The characteristic roots of the MA process \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) are...". So, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \).

Wait, perhaps the equation is actually \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), which can be rewritten as \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, yes, the coefficients are 1, -3, 1 for lags 0, 1, 2 respectively.

But then the characteristic equation is \( z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \), as above.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in forming the characteristic equation? Let me think again.

In an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is derived from the transfer function. The transfer function is \( B(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} - \dots - \phi_q z^{-q} \). So, in this case, \( B(z) = 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \).

To find the characteristic roots, we set \( B(z) = 0 \), so:

\( 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiplying both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Ah! So, actually, that's different from what I did before. So, I think earlier I confused the direction.

So, starting from \( B(z) = 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

Therefore, characteristic equation is \( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \). Then, roots would be:

\( z = [-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}]/2 = [-3 \pm \sqrt{13}]/2 \)

Wait, that still doesn't give me 1 and -3.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the MA order wrong. Because in the equation, we have \( y_t \) expressed in terms of \( u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2} \). So, is it MA(2) or MA(3)?

Wait, actually, in an MA(q) process, the maximum lag is q. So, in the equation, the highest lag is t-2, which is lag 2. So, it's MA(2). But then the transfer function is \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} \). So, plugging in \( \phi_1 = -3 \), \( \phi_2 = 1 \), so:

\( B(z) = 1 - (-3) z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^2 \):

\( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \)

So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I have the order of the process wrong. If the process is MA(3), then the transfer function would have another term.

Wait, let's see. If the process is written as \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \), that is, it includes \( u_t \), \( u_{t-1} \), and \( u_{t-2} \). So, if we think of the process, \( y_t \) is a linear combination of the last three terms of \( u_t \). So, that would be an MA(3) process.

Wait, no, in an MA(q) process, the current term is \( u_t \), and the past terms are \( u_{t-1}, u_{t-2}, ..., u_{t-q} \). So, if \( y_t \) is expressed in terms of \( u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2} \), then q=2, because the highest lag is 2.

But then, in that case, the transfer function is \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} \). So, with \( \phi_1 = -3 \), \( \phi_2 = 1 \), so \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \).

Wait, but if the process is actually MA(3), then there would be a third term \( u_{t-3} \), but in our given equation, there is no \( u_{t-3} \). So, perhaps it's MA(2).

So, then, the transfer function is \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \), which when multiplied by \( z^2 \), becomes \( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \).

So, why is the supposed answer 1 and -3? Let's check the characteristic equation if we thought it was MA(3). If it were MA(3), then the transfer function would be \( 1 - \phi_1 z^{-1} - \phi_2 z^{-2} - \phi_3 z^{-3} \). So, but in our case, the equation is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, that's MA(2). So, it's not MA(3). So, I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written incorrectly, or I misread something.

Wait, let me check the original question again: "The characteristic roots of the MA process \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) are." Options are A. 1 and 2, B. 1 and 0.5, C. 2 and -0.5, D. 1 and -3.

So, the equation is \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \). So, yes, that is a combination of \( u_t, u_{t-1}, u_{t-2} \). So, is it MA(2) or MA(3)?

Wait, actually, in the standard MA(q) model, \( y_t = \sum_{i=1}^q \phi_i u_{t-i} \). So, in our case, the equation is \( y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \). So, the highest lag is t-2, which is lag 2, so q=2.

But in that case, the transfer function is \( 1 - (-3)z^{-1} - 1 z^{-2} = 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \). So, numerator is \( 1 + 3 z^{-1} - z^{-2} \), so the characteristic equation is \( z^2 + 3 z - 1 = 0 \), which has roots with real parts \( [ -3 \pm \sqrt{13} ] / 2 \). So, approximately 2.6 and -0.6.

But the given answer is 1 and -3, which are roots of \( (z - 1)(z + 3) = z^2 + 2 z - 3 = 0 \). Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written in a different form. If I write the equation \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) as \( y_t - u_t + 3u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \), then perhaps if we take the characteristic equation as \( z^t y_t - z^t u_t + 3 z^{t-1} u_{t-1} - z^{t-2} u_{t-2} = 0 \), which when divided by \( z^t \) gives \( y(t) - u(t) + 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) - z^{-2} u(t-2) = 0 \), which is the same as \( y(t) = u(t) - 3 z^{-1} u(t-1) + z^{-2} u(t-2) \). So, same as before, the transfer function is \( 1 - 3 z^{-1} + z^{-2} \), leading to the characteristic equation \( z^2 - 3 z + 1 = 0 \).

Wait, now I'm getting conflicting results.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the MA recursion as a linear recurrence relation.

Given \( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \), then the characteristic equation is found by assuming solutions of the form \( y_t = r^t \), \( u_{t} = r^t \), etc.

But in this case, the process is a combination of y and u. So, perhaps, to find the characteristic roots, we need to consider both y and u.

Wait, perhaps the homogeneous equation is:

\( y_t - u_t + 3 u_{t-1} - u_{t-2} = 0 \)

So, if we assume solutions \( r^t \), then:

\( r^t - r^t + 3 r^{t-1} - r^{t-2} = 0 \)

Divide both sides by \( r^{t-2} \):

\( (r^2 - r^2 + 3 r - 1) = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (0) r^2 + ( - r^2 + 3 r - 1 ) = 0 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, let's do it properly.

Assuming \( y_t = r^t \), \( u_{t} = r^t \), \( u_{t-1} = r^{t-1} \), \( u_{t-2} = r^{t-2} \).

Then, substituting into the equation:

\( r^t - r^t + 3 r^{t-1} - r^{t-2} = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( 0 + 3 r^{t-1} - r^{t-2} = 0 \)

Divide both sides by \( r^{t-2} \) (assuming \( r \neq 0 \)):

\( 3 r - 1 = 0 \)

So, \( 3r - 1 = 0 \implies r = 1/3 \)

But that gives only one root, 1/3. But MA processes have multiple roots. Hmm, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe because y and u are different processes, I need to find the combined characteristic roots.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to think of this as a system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of generating functions.

Let me try that.

Define the generating functions for y and u as:

\( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} y_t z^{-t} \)

\( U(z) = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} u_t z^{-t} \)

Given the recursion:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \) for \( t \geq 1 \)

Multiply both sides by \( z^{-t} \) and sum over t from 1 to infinity:

\( \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} y_t z^{-t} = -3 \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} u_{t-1} z^{-t} + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} u_{t-2} z^{-t} + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} u_t z^{-t} \)

Simplify each term:

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z^{-1} = Y(z) - y_0 - y_1 z^{-1} \)

But since the process starts at t=1, perhaps \( y_0 = 0 \). Similarly, \( u_0 = 0 \), \( u_1 \) is the first term.

So, assuming \( y_0 = 0 \), then LHS is \( Y(z) - y_1 z^{-1} \).

But wait, actually, when t=1, y1 is expressed in terms of u0, u(-1), and u1. But since we don't have u0, maybe we need to adjust the initial conditions.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the method for ARMA processes.

Wait, but this is an MA process. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the relation in terms of Y(z) and U(z).

Given:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \)

Let me shift indices to align the terms.

For t=1:

\( y_1 = -3u_0 + u_{-1} + u_1 \)

But since u_0 = 0 and u_{-1} = 0 (assuming no backtracking), then:

\( y_1 = u_1 \)

Similarly, for t=2:

\( y_2 = -3u_1 + u_0 + u_2 = -3u_1 + u_2 \)

For t=3:

\( y_3 = -3u_2 + u_1 + u_3 \)

And so on.

So, starting from t=2, we have the recursion \( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \).

But for t=1, y1 = u1.

So, to form the generating function equation, let's write:

For t=1: \( y1 = u1 \)

For t=2: \( y2 = -3u1 + u0 + u2 \) → \( y2 = -3u1 + u2 \)

For t=3: \( y3 = -3u2 + u1 + u3 \)

For t=4: \( y4 = -3u3 + u2 + u4 \)

And so on.

Expressing each \( y_t \) in terms of u's:

So,

For t=1: \( y1 = u1 \)

For t=2: \( y2 = -3u1 + u2 \)

For t=3: \( y3 = -3u2 + u1 + u3 \)

For t=4: \( y4 = -3u3 + u2 + u4 \)

For t=5: \( y5 = -3u4 + u3 + u5 \)

Etc.

Now, let's write this as a system:

Expressed as:

\( y1 = u1 \)

\( y2 = -3u1 + u2 \)

\( y3 = u1 - 3u2 + u3 \)

\( y4 = -3u2 + u3 + u4 \)

\( y5 = u3 - 3u4 + u5 \)

Etc.

So, if we write the generating function \( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t} \) and \( U(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty u_t z^{-t} \), we can express the recursion in terms of Y(z) and U(z).

From the above, notice that starting from t=2, each \( y_t \) is a linear combination of previous u's.

So, let's write the generating function equations:

For t=1: \( y1 z^{-1} = u1 z^{-1} \)

For t=2: \( y2 z^{-2} = (-3u1 + u2) z^{-2} \)

For t=3: \( y3 z^{-3} = (u1 - 3u2 + u3) z^{-3} \)

For t=4: \( y4 z^{-4} = (-3u2 + u3 + u4) z^{-4} \)

Etc.

Adding all these up:

\( \sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t} = \sum_{t=1}^\infty u1 z^{-t} - 3 \sum_{t=2}^\infty u1 z^{-t} + \sum_{t=3}^\infty u2 z^{-t} + \sum_{t=4}^\infty u3 z^{-t} + \sum_{t=5}^\infty u4 z^{-t} + \dots \)

Wait, no, actually, it's more accurate to express each \( y_t z^{-t} \) in terms of u's.

So, from the above, we have:

\( y1 z^{-1} = u1 z^{-1} \)

\( y2 z^{-2} = -3u1 z^{-2} + u2 z^{-2} \)

\( y3 z^{-3} = u1 z^{-3} - 3u2 z^{-3} + u3 z^{-3} \)

\( y4 z^{-4} = -3u2 z^{-4} + u3 z^{-4} + u4 z^{-4} \)

And so on.

Now, summing from t=1 to infinity:

Left-hand side: \( Y(z) = y1 z^{-1} + y2 z^{-2} + y3 z^{-3} + y4 z^{-4} + \dots \)

Right-hand side:

From t=1: \( u1 z^{-1} \)

From t=2: \( -3u1 z^{-2} + u2 z^{-2} \)

From t=3: \( u1 z^{-3} - 3u2 z^{-3} + u3 z^{-3} \)

From t=4: \( -3u2 z^{-4} + u3 z^{-4} + u4 z^{-4} \)

Etc.

So, let's express this as:

\( Y(z) = u1 z^{-1} - 3u1 \sum_{t=2}^\infty z^{-2} + u2 z^{-2} + u1 \sum_{t=3}^\infty z^{-t} - 3u2 \sum_{t=3}^\infty z^{-t} + u3 z^{-3} + \dots \)

Wait, perhaps it's better to group terms by powers of u.

Notice that u1 appears in the first term and in t=3, t=5, etc.

Similarly, u2 appears starting at t=2, t=4, etc.

So, let's write:

\( Y(z) = u1 z^{-1} + u2 z^{-2} + u3 z^{-3} + u4 z^{-4} + \dots \)

Plus the terms from the recursion:

From the recursion, \( Y(z) = u1 z^{-1} - 3u1 (z^{-2} + z^{-4} + z^{-6} + \dots ) + u2 (z^{-2} + z^{-4} + z^{-6} + \dots ) + u3 (z^{-3} + z^{-5} + \dots ) + \dots \)

Wait, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, let me think about each u's contribution.

Let me denote:

\( Y(z) = \sum_{t=1}^\infty y_t z^{-t} \)

Express \( Y(z) \) in terms of U(z):

From the recursion:

\( y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t
