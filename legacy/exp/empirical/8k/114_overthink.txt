[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about designing primers for qPCR to measure a specific transcript in mouse hypertrophic muscles. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me go over the information given. The transcript is from a gene with a genomic sequence of 23.7 kb, which is 23,700 base pairs. The gene structure is described with several exons and introns. The key details are:

- The gene starts with a 128 bp 5'UTR that spans an intron. So, the 5'UTR isn't a single exon; it's split by an intron.
- The ATG starts at 6867 bp. I think this is the start codon of the coding sequence.
- The second exon ends at 8272 bp. So, from 6867 (ATG) to 8272 is the second exon, which is part of the coding sequence.
- There are three more exons after the second. The second to third exon is separated by the largest intron of 7367 bp. Then the third exon is the largest, 2126 bp long.
- The last exon contains the stop codon at 23276 bp and is about 500 bp long. So, the last exon spans from 23276 minus 500 to 23276, which would be 18276 to 23276 bp.

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. The last exon is around 500 bp, so it starts at 23276 - 500 = 22776 bp and ends at 23276 bp. So, the last exon is from 22776 to 23276.

Now, the problem is to design primers for qPCR to specifically detect the transcript. The goal is to have optimal primer placement for transcript quantification.

In qPCR, especially in the two-step process, you first make cDNA from RNA using reverse transcriptase. Then, you amplify the target transcript using specific primers. The primers are designed to anneal to the cDNA, so they should span an exon-exon junction or be entirely within a single exon to avoid genomic DNA amplification.

But the question mentions detecting the transcript specifically, so we want primers that are within the exons but not spanning any intron-exon boundaries that might be alternatively spliced. Alternatively, if the primers are within a single exon, that might be better because it ensures that the product is from cDNA and not genomic DNA.

Wait, but the question says the cDNA is synthesized from RNA, so the cDNA is already spliced. Therefore, the primers should be designed in exons such that their binding sites are in the same transcript. However, to avoid amplifying genomic DNA, primers should not be in the same genomic region because that could lead to amplification of the genomic DNA as well. So ideally, the primers should span an exon-exon junction so that they only bind if the RNA is properly spliced.

But the user is saying the correct answer is forward around 16100 bp and reverse around 23200 bp on the genomic DNA. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because if you design primers on genomic DNA, you might amplify more than just the cDNA.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. In qPCR, you have cDNA from RNA, so you don't have the introns. Therefore, if your primers are in exons that are joined in the cDNA, then your primers can be in those exons, but to avoid genomic DNA amplification, you need to make sure that the primers are not both in the same exon, because genomic DNA would also have them. But that's not necessarily the case. If you have one primer in one exon and another in a downstream exon, then in the genomic DNA, those exons are separated by an intron, so PCR would not produce a product because the DNA would have the intron in between, making the product too large or impossible to amplify under standard conditions.

Therefore, designing primers that span an exon-exon junction would prevent amplification from genomic DNA because the genomic copy would have the intron, making the product too long or not amplified efficiently. Alternatively, if the primers are in the same exon, they could amplify both cDNA and genomic DNA, but since the cDNA is the reverse transcriptase product, which is made from RNA, perhaps it's acceptable.

But in this question, the correct answer is given as forward around 16100 and reverse around 23200 on the genomic DNA. So, let's see where these positions are.

The transcript's genomic sequence is 23.7 kb. So, the last exon is from 22776 to 23276. The reverse primer is around 23200, which is within the last exon. The forward primer is around 16100 bp. Let's see where that is.

Looking at the gene structure:

- 5'UTR and first intron: starts at 1 and ends at 128 bp. Wait, but the 5'UTR is 128 bp, but it's split by an intron. So, perhaps the first exon is from 1 to some point before the intron. Let me clarify.

Wait, the information says the 5'UTR stretches over an intron. So, the 5'UTR is not a single exon. So, the first part of the 5'UTR is in the first exon, then an intron, then the rest of the 5'UTR is in the second exon.

Wait, but the ATG is at 6867 bp. So, the 5'UTR is upstream of the ATG.

So, the gene structure is as follows:

1. 5'UTR (128 bp) split by an intron.
2. Then the coding sequence starts at 6867 bp (ATG). The second exon ends at 8272 bp. So, the second exon is from 6867 to 8272.
3. Then comes the largest intron of 7367 bp, which would be from 8272 + 1 (end of second exon) to 8272 + 7367 = 15,639 bp. So, the intron is from 8273 to 15,639 bp.
4. Then the third exon is 2126 bp long, starting at 15,640 bp and ending at 15,640 + 2126 = 17,766 bp.
5. The last exon is about 500 bp long, starting at 22776 bp (23276 - 500) and ending at 23276 bp.

Wait, but the third exon is 2126 bp. So, from 15,640 to 17,766. Then comes another intron, I suppose. Wait, but the question says there are three more exons after the second. So, after the second exon (ends at 8272), comes the largest intron (7367 bp, ending at 15,639), then the third exon (2126 bp, ending at 17,766). Then, another intron, and then the last exon (500 bp, ending at 23276). Wait, that would make four exons in total, but the question says there are three more exons after the second, so total four exons, but maybe more.

Wait, perhaps the gene starts with the 5'UTR, then the first exon, then an intron, then the second exon (which includes the ATG), then intron, third exon, intron, fourth exon (last). So, total exons: four.

But the question says there are three more exons after the second. So, after the second exon, three more exons: that would make exons 3, 4, 5, and 6? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, let me clarify:

- The transcript's genomic sequence is 23.7 kb.

- The 5'UTR is 128 bp, spanning an intron. So, first part of UTR is in exon 1, then an intron, then the rest of UTR is in exon 2.

- Then, the coding sequence starts at 6867 bp (ATG). The second exon ends at 8272 bp.

- Then comes the largest intron (7367 bp), ending at 15,639 bp.

- Then exon 3 is 2126 bp, ending at 17,766 bp.

- Then, another intron, and the last exon is 500 bp, ending at 23276 bp.

So, the exons are:

1. Exon 1: 5'UTR part, ends before the intron.

2. Exon 2: from 6867 to 8272, which includes the ATG and the rest of the 5'UTR (but wait, the 5'UTR is split by an intron, so maybe exon 1 is part of the UTR, then intron, then the rest of the UTR in exon 2, followed by the coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- Exon 1: 5'UTR part (before the intron)

- Intron 1: after exon 1

- Exon 2: the rest of the 5'UTR, then the coding sequence up to 8272.

- Intron 2: 7367 bp, from 8273 to 15,639.

- Exon 3: 2126 bp, from 15,640 to 17,766.

- Intron 3: from 17,767 to say, 22775 (so 22775 - 17,767 = 500 bp? But the last exon is 500 bp, so maybe Intron 3 is from 17,767 to 22775, which is 500 bp? Wait, that can't be because 17,766 + 500 is 18,266, but the last exon is from 22776 to 23276. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the third intron is after exon 3, which is 2126 bp. So, exon 3 is from 15,640 to 17,766. Then the intron starts at 17,767 and ends at 22775 (so 500 bp), then exon 4 is from 22776 to 23276.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the gene structure is:

Exon 1: 5'UTR part (ends at position X, then intron 1)

Exon 2: from Y to 8272, which includes the rest of the UTR and the start of the coding sequence.

Intron 2: 7367 bp, so from 8272+1 to 8272+7367 = 15,639.

Exon 3: 2126 bp, from 15,640 to 17,766.

Intron 3: from 17,767 to 22775 (500 bp).

Exon 4: 500 bp, from 22776 to 23276.

So, total exons: 4.

Now, the user mentions that the correct answer is forward around 16100 and reverse around 23200 on the genomic DNA.

Wait, 16100 is within the second intron, because intron 2 ends at 15,639. So, 15,639 is intron 2 end, and intron 3 starts at 17,767. So, 16100 is between 15,639 and 17,767, which is intron 3.

But the reverse primer is around 23200, which is in the last exon (22776 to 23276). So, the forward primer is in intron 3, and the reverse is in exon 4.

But primers are designed on the genomic DNA, so if the forward primer is in intron 3 and the reverse is in exon 4, then the genomic DNA would have the intron between them, so PCR would not amplify genomic DNA, because the genomic DNA has the intron in between, making the amplicon too large. Whereas the cDNA from RNA has the exons joined, so the primers would amplify the cDNA.

But wait, if the forward primer is in intron 3 and the reverse in exon 4, then in genomic DNA, the distance between them is very large (from 16100 to 23200, which is over 7000 bp). So, when you do PCR, it's unlikely that genomic DNA would amplify because the amplicon would be too big. Therefore, the primers would specifically amplify the cDNA.

Alternatively, if both primers are in exons, then genomic DNA could have the introns in between, but the amplicon would include the introns, making it too long, but under standard PCR conditions, it's less likely to amplify. However, it's better to have primers that span an exon-exon boundary to ensure that only the spliced cDNA is amplified.

But in this case, the forward primer is in intron 3 and reverse in exon 4. Wait, but intron 3 is between exon 3 and exon 4. So, if the forward primer is in exon 3 (which ends at 17,766) and the reverse in exon 4 (starting at 22776), then the amplicon in genomic DNA would be from exon 3 to exon 4, which is separated by intron 3 (17,767 to 22775). So, genomic DNA would have a large intron in between, making the amplicon too long to amplify under standard conditions. Therefore, the primers would only amplify the cDNA, which has the exons spliced together.

Wait, but the forward primer is at 16100, which is in intron 3, which is from 17,767 to 22775. Wait, that can't be. 16100 is between 15,640 (end of exon 3) and 17,766 (start of intron 3). Wait, no, 16100 is after 15,639 (end of intron 2). So, intron 2 ends at 15,639, then exon 3 is from 15,640 to 17,766. Then intron 3 starts at 17,767. So, 16100 is within intron 3? Wait, 17,767 to 22775 is intron 3. So, 16100 is between 15,640 (exon 3 start) and 17,766 (exon 3 end). Wait, 15,640 + 2126 = 17,766. So, 16100 is between 15,640 and 17,766, which is exon 3. So, the forward primer is in exon 3, and the reverse is in exon 4.

So, in the genomic DNA, exon 3 is from 15,640 to 17,766, and exon 4 is from 22776 to 23276. The distance between them is 22776 - 17,766 = 2100 bp. So, if the primers are in exons 3 and 4, in the genomic DNA, the amplicon would be 2100 bp. But when using qPCR, the cDNA doesn't have the intron, so the amplicon would be around 2100 bp. But wait, that's quite large for a qPCR amplicon. Typically, primers are designed for amplicons around 100-250 bp.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check again.

Wait, the forward primer is around 16100 bp. Exon 3 starts at 15,640 and ends at 17,766. So, 16100 is within exon 3. The reverse primer is around 23200, which is within exon 4 (22776-23276).

So, the distance between the two primers on the genomic DNA is 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp. But in the cDNA, the exons are spliced, so the amplicon would be the size of the reverse primer site minus the forward primer site in the cDNA. Wait, no, the cDNA is the spliced mRNA, so the exons are joined. So, the amplicon from the cDNA would be from within exon 3 to exon 4, but in the cDNA, they are adjacent. So, the amplicon would be the sum of the lengths from exon 3 and exon 4 minus the point where they join. But in reality, the amplicon is just from the forward primer in exon 3 to the reverse primer in exon 4, but in the cDNA, which is shorter.

Wait, but the problem is that if the primers are in exons 3 and 4, and the cDNA has those exons spliced, then the amplicon would be from exon 3 to exon 4 in the cDNA, which is about the same as in the genomic DNA because the introns are removed. So, the size would be the same, but the issue is that the genomic DNA would also have the introns. So, the genomic DNA would have a much larger amplicon, which wouldn't be amplified efficiently under standard PCR conditions because of the large size (7100 bp), so the primers would specifically amplify the cDNA, which is the reverse-transcribed RNA.

But wait, the question is about the position of the primers. The correct answer is placing the forward primer around 16100 and the reverse around 23200. So, in the genomic DNA, that is. But when designing primers for qPCR, you usually design them based on the cDNA, which has exons spliced. So, perhaps the primers are designed within exons, but not necessarily on the genomic DNA. However, in this case, the answer is given as genomic positions.

Wait, perhaps the reasoning is that the primers should be in exons that are present in the cDNA, but to avoid genomic DNA amplification, they shouldn't be in the same exon, as that would allow both cDNA and genomic DNA to be amplified. Alternatively, they should span an exon-exon junction. But if they are in different exons that are joined in the cDNA, then the amplicon would be specific to the cDNA, as the genomic DNA would have the introns in between, making the amplicon too large.

However, the correct answer is placing the forward primer in exon 3 (around 16100) and the reverse in exon 4 (around 23200). But the size between them is 7100 bp, which is too long for qPCR, as typical amplicons are 100-250 bp. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, perhaps the primers are placed in the same exon, but that would risk amplifying genomic DNA. Alternatively, maybe the primers are placed in exons that are only present in the transcript, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: to design primers that span an exon-exon junction. For example, the forward primer in exon 3 and the reverse in exon 4, which would only be present in the spliced cDNA. So, the amplicon would be across the junction, which is only present in the cDNA, not in genomic DNA, because genomic DNA has the intron between them.

But in this case, the genomic positions are 16100 (exon 3) and 23200 (exon 4), so the amplicon would be 7100 bp in genomic DNA, but in cDNA, it's the same as the exons are joined. So, the amplicon length would be the same, but in cDNA, the product would be shorter because the introns are missing. Wait, no, the amplicon length is determined by the primers, regardless of the source. So, if the primers are in exon 3 and exon 4, the amplicon length would be the same in both cDNA and genomic DNA, which is too long for qPCR. So, perhaps the primers should be placed closer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the positions.

The user says the correct answer is forward around 16100 and reverse around 23200 on genomic DNA. So, let's see:

- Exon 3: 15,640 to 17,766.

- Exon 4: 22776 to 23276.

So, the forward primer is at 16100, which is in exon 3.

The reverse primer is at 23200, which is in exon 4.

The distance between them in the genomic DNA is 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp.

But in the cDNA, they are adjacent, so the amplicon would be from 16100 to 23200 in the cDNA, which is 7100 bp, which is way too long for qPCR. That can't be right because standard qPCR amplicons are around 100-250 bp.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try to outline the exons and introns again.

1. 5'UTR split by an intron. Let's say Exon 1: part of UTR, then Intron 1.

2. Exon 2: rest of UTR, then coding sequence starting at 6867 (ATG), ends at 8272.

3. Intron 2: 7367 bp, from 8273 to 15,639.

4. Exon 3: 2126 bp, from 15,640 to 17,766.

5. Intron 3: from 17,767 to 22775 (500 bp).

6. Exon 4: 500 bp, from 22776 to 23276.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the gene is:

Exon 1 (UTR part) -> Intron 1 -> Exon 2 (rest of UTR and coding) -> Intron 2 (7367) -> Exon 3 (2126) -> Intron 3 (500) -> Exon 4 (500).

So, total length: Exon 1 + Intron 1 + Exon 2 + Intron 2 + Exon 3 + Intron 3 + Exon 4.

But we don't know the lengths of Intron 1 and Intron 3. Wait, the question says that between the second and third exons is the largest intron of 7367 bp, which is Intron 2. Then, Intron 3 is 500 bp, as per the last exon being 500 bp.

So, the total length would be:

Exon 1 (unknown) + Intron 1 (unknown) + Exon 2 (8272 - 6867 = 1405 bp) + Intron 2 (7367) + Exon 3 (2126) + Intron 3 (500) + Exon 4 (500).

But the total genomic length is 23.7 kb = 23,700 bp.

So, let's compute:

Exon 2: 8272 - 6867 = 1405 bp.

Intron 2: 7367.

Exon 3: 2126.

Intron 3: 500.

Exon 4: 500.

Total from Exon 2 onward: 1405 + 7367 + 2126 + 500 + 500 = let's calculate:

1405 + 7367 = 8772

8772 + 2126 = 10,898

10,898 + 500 = 11,398

11,398 + 500 = 11,898.

So, from Exon 2 onward, it's 11,898 bp.

But the total genomic length is 23,700, so the rest must be Exon 1 and Intron 1.

So, 23,700 - 11,898 = 11,802 bp for Exon 1 + Intron 1.

Assuming Exon 1 is part of the 5'UTR, which is 128 bp, but split by an intron. So, Exon 1 is part of the UTR, then Intron 1, then Exon 2 (the rest of the UTR).

So, Exon 1's length plus Intron 1's length is 11,802 bp.

But without more info, it's hard to know exactly where Exon 1 ends. But for primer design, perhaps it's better to focus on the coding region.

The correct answer is placing the forward primer around 16100 and reverse around 23200.

But 16100 is in Exon 3, which is from 15,640 to 17,766. So, 16100 is within Exon 3.

The reverse primer is at 23200, which is in Exon 4 (22776 to 23276).

So, the distance between them on the genomic DNA is 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp, but in the cDNA, they are adjacent, so the amplicon would be 7100 bp, which is way too long for qPCR. That can't be right because standard qPCR uses small amplicons.

Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the primers are placed within the exons but in such a way that they span an intron in the genomic DNA, but not in the cDNA. So, to avoid amplifying genomic DNA, we need the primers to bind in exons that are separated by an intron in the genome but are adjacent in the cDNA.

Wait, but in the cDNA, the exons are spliced together, so the primers would bind to adjacent exons. Therefore, the amplicon in cDNA would be the region between the two exons, but in the genomic DNA, the same primers would be separated by an intron, making the amplicon too long, which won't amplify efficiently.

Therefore, placing the forward primer in Exon 3 and the reverse in Exon 4 would ensure that the genomic DNA is not amplified because the amplicon would be too long, while the cDNA would have the exons joined, allowing efficient amplification of the desired transcript.

But the amplicon length from 16100 to 23200 in the cDNA would be 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp, which is too long for qPCR. So, perhaps the correct answer is to place the primers within the same exon, but that's risky because it might amplify genomic DNA as well.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is to place the forward primer around 16100 and reverse around 23200 on the genomic DNA. So, perhaps the reasoning is that the amplicon in cDNA is about 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp, which is too long, but in the cDNA, the exons are spliced, so the amplicon would be shorter.

Wait, no, the amplicon length is determined by the primer positions, so if the primers are at 16100 and 23200 on the genomic DNA, in the cDNA, the amplicon would be from 16100 to 23200, which is 7100 bp. That's way too long for qPCR.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the primers should be placed in the same exon, say in Exon 3 and Exon 4, but that's not possible because they're separate exons. Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be placed in Exon 2 and Exon 3, but Exon 2 ends at 8272, and Exon 3 starts at 15,640. So, the amplicon in genomic DNA would be from 8272 to 15,640, which is 15,640 - 8272 = 7368 bp, which is the length of Intron 2. So, in cDNA, the amplicon would be from Exon 2 to Exon 3, which would be around 2126 bp, which is Exon 3's length. But again, that's too long for qPCR.

Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be placed in Exon 4, but that's the last exon, which might not give enough amplicon.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to design the primers to span the exon-exon junction between Exon 2 and Exon 3, but Exon 2 ends at 8272, and Exon 3 starts at 15,640, so the amplicon would be 15,640 - 8272 = 7368 bp, which is Intron 2. So, that's too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be in Exon 3 and Exon 4, which are 2126 and 500 bp long. So, placing the forward primer in Exon 3 (say around 16100) and reverse in Exon 4 (around 23200). Then, in the cDNA, the amplicon would be 23200 - 16100 = 7100 bp. That's still too big.

Wait, maybe the answer is that the primers should be placed in the same exon, but that's risky because it might amplify genomic DNA. Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be placed in the coding region of Exon 2, but the amplicon would be too short. Wait, let's see.

Exon 2 is from 6867 to 8272, which is 1405 bp. So, placing primers in Exon 2, say around 7000 and 8000. The amplicon would be 1000 bp, which is manageable. But then, the genomic DNA would have the same amplicon length, which might be okay because the intron is between Exon 2 and Exon 3, which is 7367 bp. So, in genomic DNA, the amplicon would be Exon 2 primers, which is 1405 bp, but with intron 2 in between, so the amplicon would be 1405 + 7367 = 8772 bp, which is too long. So, in cDNA, it's 1405 bp, which is manageable.

But the correct answer is to place the primers in Exon 3 and Exon 4. So, perhaps the reasoning is that Exon 3 is the largest exon, so placing the forward primer in Exon 3 (around 16100) and reverse in Exon 4 (23200) ensures that the amplicon is in the larger exon, which might have more cDNA for better amplification. Also, by placing them in Exon 3 and 4, the amplicon is in the region after the large intron, which might be less prone to genomic DNA amplification because the distance is too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to design the primers in the last exon, but the last exon is only 500 bp, which is too small for the amplicon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the primers should be placed in such a way that they span an intron in the genomic DNA. For example, the forward primer in Exon 3 and reverse primer in Exon 4. In the cDNA, these exons are adjacent, so the amplicon would be 2126 + 500 = 2626 bp, which is too long. But in genomic DNA, the amplicon would be from Exon 3 to Exon 4, which is 22500 - 16700 = 5800 bp, which is too long to amplify.

Alternatively, if the primers are placed in Exon 3 and Exon 2, but that would require spanning an intron, which might not be efficient.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The correct answer is placing the forward primer around 16100 and reverse around 23200 on the genomic DNA. This corresponds to Exon 3 (15,640-17,766) and Exon 4 (22,776-23,276). The amplicon in cDNA would be from 16100 to 23200, which is 7100 bp, which is too long. Therefore, perhaps the reasoning is that in cDNA, the exons are spliced, so the amplicon is shorter. Wait, no, the amplicon length is determined by the primers' positions, not the exons. So, if the primers are at 16100 and 23200 on the genomic DNA, in cDNA, they would bind at the same positions, resulting in a 7100 bp amplicon, which is too long.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to place the primers in the same exon, but that would risk amplifying genomic DNA. Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be placed in Exon 2 and Exon 3, but that would make the amplicon in cDNA around 2126 bp, which is too long.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is to place the forward primer in Exon 2 and reverse in Exon 3, but that would be 8272 - 6867 = 1405 bp apart, which is manageable, but the genomic DNA would have the 7367 bp intron in between, making the amplicon too long. So, only cDNA would amplify.

But the correct answer given is forward in 16100 and reverse in 23200. So, perhaps the reasoning is that the amplicon in cDNA is shorter because the exons are joined. Wait, no, the amplicon length is from the forward primer to the reverse primer, regardless of the source. So, 16100 to 23200 is 7100 bp, which is way too long.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to place the primers in Exon 3 and Exon 4, but to have the amplicon within the same exon, but that's not possible because they are different exons.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to place the forward primer in Exon 2 and the reverse in Exon 3, which would result in an amplicon in cDNA of about 2126 - (position in Exon 2). For example, if the forward primer is at 6867 (ATG) and the reverse at 15,640 (start of Exon 3), the amplicon would be 15,640 - 6867 = 8883 bp, which is too long.

I think I'm going around in circles. Let me try to think of the key point.

The goal is to design primers that specifically amplify the cDNA (spliced mRNA) and not genomic DNA. To do this, the primers should be placed in such a way that in genomic DNA, the amplicon would be too large to amplify, while in cDNA, the amplicon is the correct size.

Therefore, the primers should span an intron in the genomic DNA. For example, the forward primer in Exon 2 and reverse in Exon 3. In genomic DNA, the amplicon would be Exon 2 + Intron 2 + Exon 3, which is 1405 + 7367 + 2126 = 11,898 bp, which is too long. In cDNA, the amplicon would be Exon 2 to Exon 3, which is 1405 + 2126 = 3531 bp, which is still too long.

Alternatively, placing the forward primer in Exon 3 and reverse in Exon 4. In genomic DNA, the amplicon would be Intron 3 (500) + Exon 4 (500) = 1000 bp, but no, because the forward is in Exon 3 and reverse in Exon 4, the genomic DNA would have Exon 3, Intron 3, Exon 4, which is 2126 + 500 + 500 = 3126 bp. In cDNA, the amplicon is Exon 3 to Exon 4, which is 2126 + 500 = 2626 bp, still too long.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is to place the primers in the same exon, but that's risky. Alternatively, perhaps the primers should be placed in the last exon, but that's only 500 bp, so the amplicon would be too short.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is to place the primers in Exon 4, but that would only give a small amplicon, which is better for qPCR. So, place both primers in Exon 4. But that would amplify both cDNA and genomic DNA, which we don't want.

Alternatively, place one primer in Exon 3 and the other in Exon 4. In genomic DNA, the amplicon would include Intron 3, making it too long. In
