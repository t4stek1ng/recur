[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about matrices and quantum states. The user provided four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. The task is to figure out why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, a state is represented by a density matrix. So, to determine if a matrix is a valid density matrix, it needs to satisfy certain conditions.

First, I recall that a density matrix, or quantum state, must be Hermitian. That means the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. So, for each matrix, I should check if it's Hermitian. Let me check each one:

Starting with W:
W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
Let me conjugate each element and transpose the matrix. Transposing W would swap the off-diagonal elements: (i/4, -i/4). Taking the conjugate of each element: (-i/4, -i/4). So the conjugate transpose of W is (1/2, -i/4; -i/4, 1/2). Comparing this to W itself, which is (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). They are not the same unless i/4 equals -i/4, which isn't true. Wait, that can't be right because i is the imaginary unit. So, W is not Hermitian? But the answer says W is a quantum state. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should check if W is Hermitian step by step. The (1,2) entry is i/4, so its conjugate transpose is -i/4. But W's (2,1) entry is -i/4, which is indeed the conjugate of i/4. So, actually, W is Hermitian because W^dagger = W. So, W is Hermitian.

Similarly, check for X:
X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)
Is X Hermitian? The (1,2) entry is 1, so its conjugate is also 1. The (2,1) entry is 1 as well. So, X is Hermitian.

Y:
Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)
Check Hermitian: (1,2) is i/3, conjugate is -i/3, which is Y's (2,1) entry. So Y is Hermitian.

Z:
Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)
Check Hermitian: (1,2) is 1/4, conjugate is 1/4. (2,1) is 1/4. So Z is Hermitian.

Okay, all four matrices are Hermitian. So, that's the first condition. But density matrices have more constraints.

Next, the trace of the density matrix must be 1. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let me check each matrix:

For W:
Diagonal entries are 1/2 and 1/2. Sum is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Good.

For X:
Diagonal entries are 1/3 and 2/3. Sum is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

For Y:
Diagonal entries are 1/2 and 1/2. Sum is 1. Good.

For Z:
Diagonal entries are 2/3 and 1/3. Sum is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

So, all four matrices have trace 1. That's another condition.

Third condition: The matrix must be positive semi-definite, meaning all its eigenvalues are non-negative. Since all these matrices are 2x2, it might be easier to check if they are positive semi-definite by examining their leading principal minors, also known as the Sylvester's criterion.

For a 2x2 matrix, positive semi-definite if and only if the leading principal minors are non-negative. The leading principal minors are the top-left 1x1 and 2x2 determinants.

Let me compute the determinants for each matrix.

Starting with W:
W = |1/2  i/4|
    |-i/4 1/2|

Determinant of W: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (i * -i)/16 = 1/4 - (i^2)/16 = 1/4 - (-1)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16. That's positive, so W is positive definite, hence positive semi-definite.

For X:
X = |1/3  1|
     |1   2/3|

Determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Hmm, that's negative. Wait, that can't be good. If the determinant is negative, the matrix is not positive definite. But the answer says X is a quantum state. Did I compute this correctly?

Wait, determinant of X: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = (2/9 - 9/9) = -7/9. Negative. So, determinant is negative, which would mean X is not positive semi-definite. But the answer says it is a quantum state. That seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me recalculate:

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222
(1)(1) = 1
So, 2/9 - 1 = -7/9 ≈ -0.777. Negative. So, determinant is negative, which implies X is not positive semi-definite. But then, how come it's considered a quantum state?

Wait, maybe I misread the matrix. Let me check again. X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, entries are 1/3 and 1 in the first row; 1 and 2/3 in the second row.

Wait, is there a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe I'm missing something. Because if the determinant is negative, the matrix isn't positive semi-definite, hence not a valid density matrix. But the answer says X is a quantum state. Maybe I did something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a density matrix? But the answer claims it is. Maybe I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, determinant is (a*d - b*c). So for X:

a = 1/3, b = 1, c = 1, d = 2/3.

So, determinant = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. So, X cannot be a density matrix because it's not positive semi-definite. But according to the answer, it's a quantum state. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the matrices.

Wait, maybe the matrices are not 2x2? Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the matrices are written as rows separated by semicolons. For X, it's (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, yes, 2x2. So determinant is definitely negative. Maybe the answer is wrong, or maybe I misread the matrices.

Wait, the user wrote: "Why the correct answer is: W, X, and Z are quantum states." So, according to the user, X is a quantum state, but according to my calculation, it's not positive semi-definite.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix X is actually different? Let me double-check. X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Wait, is that correct? If so, determinant is negative. Maybe the matrix was supposed to be (1/3, 1/1; 1, 2/3)? But no, it's 1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the matrices. Are they 2x2? Let me check the dimensions:

W: 2x2, correct.

X: 2x2, correct.

Y: 2x2, correct.

Z: 2x2, correct.

So, they are all 2x2. So, X's determinant is negative, meaning it's not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix. But according to the answer, it's a quantum state. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the Hermitian condition. Wait, no, X is (1/3,1;1,2/3), which is Hermitian because (1,2) is 1, (2,1) is 1, and all are real. So, it's Hermitian. Trace is 1. So, except for the determinant, it meets the other conditions. But determinant is negative, so it's not positive semi-definite.

Wait, maybe the answer is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the matrix is not 2x2? Wait, no, it's definitely 2x2.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is actually different. Let me check the problem statement again. It says X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, yes, 1 in the off-diagonal. So, unless the user made a typo, perhaps it's correct.

But then, if X is not a density matrix, why does the answer say it is? Alternatively, maybe the answer is correct, and I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should check the eigenvalues of X. If the determinant is negative, one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, which would make it not positive semi-definite. So, unless I made a mistake, X is not a valid density matrix.

But the answer says W, X, and Z are quantum states. Maybe the user is wrong? Or perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the matrices are 3x3? Let me check the dimensions again. The user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

That's 2x2.

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3) 2x2.

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2) 2x2.

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3) 2x2.

So, all are 2x2. So, unless I'm missing something, X is not a density matrix because its determinant is negative.

Wait, maybe the matrices are actually 4x4? But the way they are written, with two elements separated by semicolons, suggests 2x2.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the matrices. Let me check W again.

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So, first row: 1/2, i/4. Second row: -i/4, 1/2.

Check determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (-i²)/16 = 1/4 - (-1)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16 ≈ 0.3125. Positive. So, W is positive definite.

Similarly, let me check Y:

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) = 1/4 - (-i²)/9 = 1/4 - (-1)/9 = 1/4 + 1/9 ≈ 0.25 + 0.111 = 0.361. Positive. So, Y is positive definite.

Now, Z:

Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Determinant: (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/16 ≈ 0.222 - 0.0625 = 0.1595. Positive. So, Z is positive definite.

But X's determinant is negative, so it's not positive definite, hence not a density matrix. So, the answer seems incorrect. Or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, another thought: maybe the matrices are 1x2 or 2x1? But no, they are written as square matrices with semicolons, so 2x2.

Alternatively, maybe the matrices are actually 3x3, but the user just wrote them as 2x2? Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe X is supposed to be (1/3, 1/1; 1, 2/3), but no, it's written as 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if X is a projectors, but no, density matrices are more general.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the user is considering only the first condition (Hermitian, trace 1) and not the positivity? But no, density matrices require positive semi-definite.

Wait, let me think: in quantum mechanics, density matrices must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have trace 1. So, if X is not positive semi-definite, it cannot be a density matrix.

But the answer says it is. So, there must be something wrong here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the matrices. Let me compute the determinant again.

X = |1/3   1     |
       |1     2/3  |

Determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = -7/9 ≈ -0.777. Negative.

So, eigenvalues are (trace ± sqrt(trace² - 4 determinant))/2. Trace is 1, determinant is -7/9.

So, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(-7/9))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(37/9)]/2 = [1 ± (√37)/3]/2.

Approximately, sqrt(37) ≈ 6.08, so 6.08/3 ≈ 2.027. So, eigenvalues are [1 + 2.027]/2 ≈ 1.513 and [1 - 2.027]/2 ≈ -0.513. Negative eigenvalue, so X is not positive semi-definite.

Thus, X cannot be a density matrix. But the answer says it is. So, perhaps the answer is incorrect, or perhaps I misread the matrix.

Wait, maybe the matrix X is different. Let me check again:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Yes, that's what the user wrote.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant different matrices, but I don't think so.

So, perhaps the answer is incorrect, or maybe the matrices were intended to be different. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the structure.

Wait, perhaps the matrices are meant to be 3x3, but written as 2x2? No, the way they are written is 2x2.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a different convention, like row vectors, but that shouldn't affect the density matrix conditions.

Hmm, this is confusing. According to the conditions, W, X, and Z are Hermitian, have trace 1, but X is not positive semi-definite. So, only W and Z are quantum states, but the answer says W, X, and Z.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is incorrect, or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the user forgot to mention that X is not a quantum state? Or maybe X is not a density matrix. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that X is not a density matrix, so the answer is wrong.

But the user says: "Why the correct answer is: W, X, and Z are quantum states." So, perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the matrices are not 2x2 but 4x4 or something. Let me see:

Wait, the user wrote:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

That's 2x2.

Similarly, X, Y, Z are all 2x2.

So, unless the user made a typo in the matrix entries, perhaps X is not a density matrix.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the matrices as being something else. For example, maybe they are written in a different format, like rows separated by semicolons but with more elements. But no, they are 2x2.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write different matrices, but I don't think so.

So, to conclude, based on my analysis:

- W: Hermitian, trace 1, positive definite. Yes, quantum state.

- X: Hermitian, trace 1, but determinant negative, not positive definite. Not a quantum state.

- Y: Hermitian, trace 1, positive definite. Yes, quantum state.

- Z: Hermitian, trace 1, positive definite. Yes, quantum state.

But the answer says W, X, and Z. So, perhaps the answer is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that X is a valid quantum state despite having a negative determinant because it's a pure state or something. Wait, no, density matrices must have non-negative determinant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the user is considering that X is a valid state because it's diagonalizable or something, but that doesn't matter. The determinant being negative is the key.

Alternatively, maybe the user forgot to mention that X is not a quantum state, so the correct answer is W, Y, Z. But the user says W, X, Z.


[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this problem here with four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. I need to figure out why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, okay. I remember that for a matrix to be a quantum state, it must be a density matrix. A density matrix has some specific properties. Let me try to recall those.

First, the density matrix must be Hermitian. That means the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. So, if I take the matrix, flip it along the diagonal, and take the complex conjugate of each element, it should come out the same as the original matrix. I can check this for each of the matrices W, X, and Z.

Second, all the eigenvalues of the density matrix must be non-negative. This ensures that the matrix is positive semi-definite. Also, the trace of the density matrix should equal 1. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So, I should calculate the trace of each matrix and check that it's 1, and then ensure all the eigenvalues are non-negative.

Alright, let's start with matrix W.

**Matrix W:**
W = (1/2, i/4;
     -i/4, 1/2)

First, check if W is Hermitian. Let me take the conjugate transpose of W. The original matrix is:

[ [1/2, i/4],
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Taking the conjugate of each element:

[ [1/2, -i/4],
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Now, transpose this matrix by swapping the off-diagonal elements:

[ [1/2, i/4],
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's the same as the original matrix. So, W is Hermitian. Good.

Next, check the trace. The diagonal elements are 1/2 and 1/2, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Perfect, trace is 1.

Now, let's find the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. The characteristic equation is λ² - trace(W)λ + determinant = 0.

Trace of W is 1, so:

λ² - λ + determinant = 0

Compute the determinant of W:

(1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (i * -i)/16

Wait, let's calculate that:

First term: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4

Second term: (i/4)(-i/4) = (-i²)/16 = (-(-1))/16 = 1/16

So determinant = 1/4 - 1/16 = 4/16 - 1/16 = 3/16

So the characteristic equation is λ² - λ + 3/16 = 0

Solve for λ:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(3/16))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 3/4)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1/4)]/2 = [1 ± 1/2]/2

So eigenvalues:

(1 + 1/2)/2 = (3/2)/2 = 3/4

(1 - 1/2)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4

Both eigenvalues are positive (3/4 and 1/4), so W is positive semi-definite. Therefore, W is a density matrix. So, it's a quantum state.

Moving on to matrix X.

**Matrix X:**
X = (1/3, 1;
     1, 2/3)

First, check if X is Hermitian. Let's take the conjugate transpose.

Original matrix:

[ [1/3, 1],
  [1, 2/3] ]

Conjugate each element:

[ [1/3, 1],
  [1, 2/3] ]

Transpose the matrix by swapping the off-diagonal elements:

[ [1/3, 1],
  [1, 2/3] ]

Same as original, so X is Hermitian.

Next, trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Eigenvalues: Again, for 2x2, trace is 1, determinant:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9

Wait, negative determinant. Hmm, but for a density matrix, determinant must be non-negative. Because if determinant is negative, the matrix isn't positive semi-definite. That would mean it's not a valid density matrix. Wait, but the answer says X is a quantum state. Did I compute something wrong?

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the determinant.

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9

(1)(1) = 1

So determinant = 2/9 - 1 = (2 - 9)/9 = (-7)/9. So yes, it's negative. That would imply X is not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix. But according to the answer, X is a quantum state. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check my Hermiticity again.

Is X Hermitian?

Yes, because the off-diagonal elements are real, and the diagonal elements are real. So, the conjugate transpose is same as the original, so X is Hermitian.

Hmm, but determinant is negative. How come? If the determinant is negative, the matrix isn't positive semi-definite, meaning it can't be a density matrix. So, that conflicts with the given answer. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the determinant.

Wait, X is:

[ [1/3, 1],
  [1, 2/3] ]

So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = (-7)/9. Yeah, that's negative.

So, this would imply that X is not a valid density matrix. But the answer says it is. Hmm.

Wait, is there a typo in the matrix X? Let me check the original question again.

Original matrices:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, in the original question, the second matrix is written as X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Is that correct? Or is it perhaps (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3) or maybe (1/3, something else)?

Wait, no, I think it's correct.

Wait, hold on, in matrix X, the (1,2) element is 1, which is real, so it's okay. But the determinant is negative. That should be a problem.

Wait, maybe I should check if I can write X as a convex combination of projectors onto two vectors.

Because for a density matrix, it's equivalent to being expressible as |ψ><ψ| + |φ><φ| where |ψ| and |φ| are normalized vectors. Or more generally, a convex combination of such projectors.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixed state, so it's a convex combination, but perhaps if it's positive definite, it's pure, otherwise mixed. But in any case, the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

Wait, but X has negative determinant, so its eigenvalues have opposite signs. Let me compute the eigenvalues to confirm.

Characteristic equation for X: λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0 => λ² - λ - 7/9 = 0

Solutions:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(37/9)] / 2 = [1 ± (√37)/3] / 2

Compute sqrt(37): approximately 6.08. So, sqrt(37)/3 ≈ 2.027

Thus, λ ≈ (1 + 2.027)/2 ≈ 1.513 and λ ≈ (1 - 2.027)/2 ≈ -0.513

So one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative. That definitely means X is not positive semi-definite, so it can't be a density matrix. Hmm, that contradicts the given answer. Maybe the user is wrong? Or maybe I misread the matrix.

Wait, wait. Let me check the original matrix X again.

Wait, the user wrote X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Is that correct? Or perhaps it's (1/3, something else; something else, 2/3). Let me check the original question.

Wait, the user wrote: X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So it's a 2x2 matrix with entries (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, yeah, that's correct.

So, if X is (1/3,1;1,2/3), then its trace is 1, determinant is negative, eigenvalues have opposite signs. So, X is not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix. So, it shouldn't be a quantum state. But the answer says it is. Hmm, that's confusing.

Maybe the answer is incorrect? Or perhaps I made a mistake in Hermiticity.

Wait, no, X is real, so it's Hermitian. So, it should have real eigenvalues, but determinant negative. So, negative eigenvalues. Thus, it's not positive semi-definite. Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state.

Wait, this is odd. The given answer is that W, X, and Z are quantum states, but X seems to fail. Maybe I need to check Z as well.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant of X. Let's recalculate.

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9

(1)(1) = 1

So determinant = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = (-7)/9. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so it's negative. So, X is not a density matrix. Therefore, the answer given is incorrect. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the matrices are supposed to be in a different basis? Or maybe the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is correct because it's considering the density matrix in the computational basis, and even if determinant is negative, it's Hermitian and trace one, but no—determinant negative is a requirement for positive semi-definite.

Wait, positive semi-definite matrices must have all eigenvalues non-negative, which implies determinant non-negative. So, negative determinant implies not positive semi-definite. Therefore, X is not a density matrix.

This is confusing because the answer says X is a quantum state. Hmm. Maybe I need to double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the user wrote X incorrectly. Maybe the matrix is (1/3, i; -i, 2/3), if so, then it's not Hermitian. Wait, no, if it's (1/3,1;1,2/3), it's Hermitian.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the matrix, maybe it's supposed to be (1/3, 1/2;1/2, 2/3). Then determinant would be (1/3)(2/3) - (1/2)(1/2) = 2/9 - 1/4 = (8 - 9)/36 = -1/36. Still negative.

Wait, maybe (1/3, 1/4;1/4, 2/3). Then determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/16 = (32 - 9)/144 = 23/144 > 0. Then eigenvalues would be positive. But the matrix is as given.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is considering that X is a density matrix because it's diagonalizable with non-negative eigenvalues, but determinant negative would imply it's not.

Wait, maybe the matrix is not diagonalizable? No, 2x2 matrices are always diagonalizable. If determinant is negative, eigenvalues have opposite signs, so it's not positive semi-definite.

Wait, maybe I should also compute the eigenvalues for X.

As above, the eigenvalues are approximately 1.513 and -0.513, which are both real because the matrix is Hermitian.

Thus, negative eigenvalue, so X is not positive semi-definite. So, not a density matrix, not a quantum state. So, the given answer might be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant X is (1/3, i; -i, 2/3). In that case, X would be Hermitian, trace 1, determinant (1/3)(2/3) - (i)(-i) = 2/9 - (-1) = 2/9 +1 = 11/9 >0. Then, eigenvalues would be positive.

But in the given problem, X is (1/3,1;1,2/3). So, as it is, X is not a density matrix.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Let me proceed to check Z now, maybe Z is a valid density matrix, so if W, X, Z are given as quantum states, but X isn't, perhaps it's a mistake.

**Matrix Z:**
Z = (2/3, 1/4;
     1/4, 1/3)

First, check Hermiticity. The matrix is:

[ [2/3, 1/4],
  [1/4, 1/3] ]

Conjugate transpose:

[ [2/3, 1/4],
  [1/4, 1/3] ]

Same as original, so Z is Hermitian.

Trace: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

Compute determinant:

(2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/16

Convert to common denominator: 32/144 - 9/144 = 23/144 >0

So determinant is positive, which is good.

Now, find eigenvalues. Since trace is 1 and determinant is 23/144, the characteristic equation is λ² - λ + 23/144 = 0

Compute discriminant:

1 - 4*(23/144) = 1 - 92/144 = (144 - 92)/144 = 52/144 = 13/36

So eigenvalues:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(13/36)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(13)/6] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(13)] /12

sqrt(13) ≈ 3.605

So:

(6 + 3.605)/12 ≈ 9.605/12 ≈ 0.8004

(6 - 3.605)/12 ≈ 2.395/12 ≈ 0.1996

Both eigenvalues are positive, so Z is positive semi-definite. Therefore, Z is a density matrix, hence a quantum state.

So, going back, it seems W is valid, X is not, and Z is valid. But the answer says W, X, and Z are quantum states. So, perhaps the answer is incorrect regarding X.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering X. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the matrix X is not as given. Wait, let me check the original problem.

Wait, in the original problem, the matrices are written as:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, in the matrix Z, the first entry is written as 2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3. Maybe that's a formatting issue. In matrix notation, it should be 2/3 in the (1,1) position, 1/4 in (1,2); 1/4 in (2,1), and 1/3 in (2,2). Which is the same as I thought.

So, Z is Hermitian, trace 1, positive determinant, positive eigenvalues. So Z is a quantum state.

Now, X: Hermitian, trace 1, but negative determinant. So, not a quantum state.

Therefore, the given answer that W, X, and Z are quantum states is incorrect because X is not a quantum state.

Wait, but the question says "Why the correct answer is: W, X, and Z are quantum states."

So, maybe the user is asking why that is the case, not that the answer is correct. Maybe the user wants us to explain why W, X, and Z are quantum states.

But in that case, perhaps X is a quantum state because it is positive definite? But wait, no, determinant is negative.

Wait, perhaps the user wants the assistant to verify that W, X, and Z are quantum states, and the assistant is to explain why, and the correct answer is that.

But in that case, the assistant should note that X is not a quantum state, so W and Z are, but X is not. Therefore, the given answer is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation with X.

Wait, let me check the determinant again.

X = [ [1
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have these four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. They're all 2x2 matrices, and each has complex entries. The question is about why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, I remember that for a matrix to be a quantum state, it needs to be a density matrix. Right, a density matrix, or density operator, is a positive semi-definite matrix with trace equal to 1. Also, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative and sum up to 1. 

So, maybe I need to check each of these matrices W, X, Z to see if they satisfy these conditions. Wait, but Y is not mentioned, so maybe Y is not a quantum state? I need to verify that as well, but the question is specifically about W, X, and Z. 

First, let's recall the properties of a density matrix. 

1. It must be Hermitian. That is, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. 

2. It must be positive semi-definite, meaning all its eigenvalues are non-negative.

3. The trace of the matrix must be 1. 

So, I need to check each of these matrices for W, X, and Z. Maybe I'll start with matrix W.

**Matrix W:**
W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

Is W Hermitian? Let's check. 

The conjugate transpose of W is:

First row: 1/2, -i/4

Second row: i/4, 1/2

Comparing to W: first row is 1/2, i/4; second row is -i/4, 1/2. So, it's not immediately obvious if W is Hermitian.

Wait, let me compute the conjugate transpose of W:

Original W:
[ [1/2, i/4],
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Conjugate transpose would flip the matrix and take the conjugate of each element.

So, the (1,2) element becomes the (2,1) element, and we take the conjugate.

First row of conjugate transpose: [1/2, -i/4]

Second row: [i/4, 1/2]

Comparing to W's entries:

Second row of W is [-i/4, 1/2], which is same as the first row of the conjugate transpose. So, W is equal to its conjugate transpose? Let me see:

Wait, W's second row is [-i/4, 1/2], while the conjugate transpose's first row is [1/2, -i/4]. So, if we transpose W, we get:

[ [1/2, -i/4],
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Which is the same as the conjugate transpose. So, for W, is it equal to its conjugate transpose?

Original W: [ [1/2, i/4],
               [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Compare to conjugate transpose:

[ [1/2, -i/4],
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

So, the (1,2) entry is i/4 vs. -i/4. So, not equal. Therefore, W is not Hermitian? That's confusing because I thought all density matrices are Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's double-check.

Wait, for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must satisfy M_ij = conjugate(M_ji). 

So, check for W:

M12 = i/4, M21 = -i/4. Is M12 equal to the conjugate of M21? 

M21 conjugate is (-i/4)*, which is i/4. 

So, M12 = i/4, which is equal to the conjugate of M21. So, W is Hermitian. Hmm, okay, so my initial thought was wrong because I confused the entries.

So, W is Hermitian.

Next, trace of W. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Good.

Now, check if it's positive semi-definite. For that, we need to find its eigenvalues. Alternatively, since it's a 2x2 matrix, we can check the principal minors.

The principal minors are the determinants of the top-left 1x1 and the entire 2x2 matrix.

First minor: 1/2. Which is positive, so that's good.

Second minor: determinant of W.

Compute determinant:

|W| = (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = (1/4) - (-i^2/16) = (1/4) - (-(-1)/16) = (1/4) - (1/16) = (4/16 - 1/16) = 3/16.

Which is positive. So, both principal minors are positive, hence W is positive definite, which implies all eigenvalues are positive. So, W is a density matrix. Okay, so W is a quantum state.

Now, moving on to X:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

First, check if X is Hermitian.

Check M12 vs M21 conjugate.

M12 = 1, M21 = 1. So, M12 is 1, which is equal to the conjugate of M21, which is also 1. So, X is Hermitian.

Trace of X: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Check principal minors.

First minor: 1/3 > 0.

Second minor: determinant of X.

|X| = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = (2/9 - 9/9) = (-7/9).

Negative determinant. Uh-oh, that's a problem. Because determinant negative implies that the matrix is not positive semi-definite, since the second leading principal minor is negative. Therefore, X is not positive semi-definite, so it's not a density matrix.

Wait, but the claim was that W, X, and Z are quantum states. So, if X is not positive semi-definite, then maybe I messed up the determinant.

Let me compute |X| again:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = (-7/9). Yeah, that's negative. So, X is not a density matrix. Hmm. So, maybe the claim is incorrect? Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check matrix X again. Did I write it correctly? The user wrote X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, it's a 2x2 matrix with 1/3 and 1 in the first row, and 1 and 2/3 in the second row.

So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. So, negative. Therefore, not positive semi-definite. So, X cannot be a density matrix. Hmm, so the initial statement that W, X, and Z are quantum states must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the determinant? Let me compute it again.

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9.

(1)(1) = 1.

2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Yeah, that's correct. So, negative determinant.

Wait, perhaps the matrix was meant to be diagonal? If X was diagonal, then the determinant would be (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9, which is positive, but X is not diagonal.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo? Wait, checking the original matrices:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)

Wait, for Z, the user wrote (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3). So, maybe there's a typo in X? Or perhaps it's a different matrix? Hmm, unless the matrix was (1/3,1;1,2/3), which is what I thought.

Alternatively, if the user wrote it differently... Wait, let me check again.

Original X: (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, entry (1,2) is 1, and (2,1) is 1. So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. So, not positive semi-definite. Therefore, not a density matrix.

Wait, but the answer says W, X, Z are quantum states. So, perhaps I need to re-examine my reasoning. Maybe I made a mistake in the determinant?

Wait, let me compute it once more:

Top-left: 1/3, top-right: 1.

Left-bottom: 1, bottom-right: 2/3.

So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is supposed to be a different matrix? Or maybe the user meant something else. Wait, perhaps the matrix is (1/3,1;1, 2/3) with 1/3 and 2/3 on the diagonal, but is that correct?

Wait, if X was diagonal, (1/3, 0; 0, 2/3), then determinant would be (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9, which is positive. But X is not diagonal. So, unless I made a mistake in understanding the matrix. Wait, maybe the user wrote the matrix in a different format? Like, maybe the semicolon is separating columns or something else? Wait, no, the format is: first row, second row, separated by semicolons. So, the first row is 1/3, 1; second row is 1, 2/3.

So, that's correct. So, X is a 2x2 matrix with 1/3,1;1, 2/3.

So, negative determinant. So, X is not positive semi-definite.

Wait, maybe I should check Z as well, to see if maybe it's not a quantum state either, but the claim says it is.

So, moving on to Z.

**Matrix Z:**
Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

First, check if Z is Hermitian.

M12 = 1/4, M21 = 1/4. So, M12 = conjugate(M21). So, yes, Z is Hermitian.

Trace of Z: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

Principal minors:

First minor: 2/3 > 0.

Second minor: determinant of Z.

Compute |Z| = (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = (2/9) - (1/16).

Convert to common denominator, which is 144:

2/9 = 32/144, 1/16 = 9/144. So, 32/144 - 9/144 = 23/144. Positive.

So, determinant is positive. Therefore, Z is positive semi-definite. So, Z is a density matrix, hence a quantum state.

So, summarizing:

- W: Hermitian, trace 1, positive semi-definite (eigenvalues positive) => quantum state.

- X: Hermitian, trace 1, but determinant negative => not positive semi-definite => not a quantum state.

- Z: Hermitian, trace 1, positive determinant => positive semi-definite => quantum state.

Therefore, only W and Z are quantum states. But the answer says W, X, and Z. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in X? Let me think again. Maybe X is Hermitian, trace 1, but determinant is negative, so it's not positive semi-definite.

Alternatively, maybe X is not 2x2? Wait, X is given as (1/3,1;1,2/3). So, 2x2. Maybe the user made a typo in the matrix entries? Wait, unless the second row is different.

Wait, in the original question: 

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So, 1 in (1,2), 1 in (2,1). So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - 1*1 = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9.

Hmm. So, negative.

Wait, unless the matrix was meant to be diagonal? If so, (1/3, 0;0,2/3) is positive definite, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's off-diagonal elements are different. Maybe X is (1/3,1;1,1/3). Then, determinant is (1/3)(1/3) - (1)(1) = 1/9 -1 = negative. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe the user wrote X as (1/3,1;1,2/3), but it was supposed to be (1/3,1;1,2/3) with a different second row. Wait, unless the second row was (1, 2/3), which is as written.

So, I think the determinant is indeed negative, so X is not a quantum state.

So, why does the answer say W, X, and Z are quantum states? Is there a misunderstanding?

Wait, perhaps the matrices are not 2x2? Wait, W and Y are given as 2x2 with complex entries, X is 2x2 with real entries, and Z is 2x2 as well.

Alternatively, maybe X is a density matrix due to something else? Wait, no, because the determinant has to be positive for positive semi-definite. If determinant is negative, the matrix is indefinite, so eigenvalues can be negative. So, not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only W and Z, but the given answer says W, X, Z. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a density matrix because it's a valid state in another context? But no, density matrices in quantum mechanics must be Hermitian, have trace 1, and be positive semi-definite. X fails the last condition.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking X's determinant is negative.

Wait, let me compute |X| again:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. So, no, X is not positive semi-definite.

Wait, perhaps I've confused the off-diagonal elements? In the given matrix X, (1,2) is 1 and (2,1) is 1, right? So, determinant is negative.

Therefore, unless the answer is incorrect, perhaps only W and Z are quantum states. But the answer says W, X, Z. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check Y as well, just to be thorough.

**Matrix Y:**
Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Is Y Hermitian?

Compute conjugate transpose:

First row: 1/2, i/3; second row: -i/3, 1/2.

Wait, original Y is:

[ [1/2, i/3],
  [-i/3, 1/2] ]

Conjugate transpose would be:

First row: 1/2, -i/3

Second row: i/3, 1/2

Compare to Y:

Second row is -i/3, 1/2 vs. first row of conjugate transpose: 1/2, -i/3.

So, Y ≠ conjugate transpose(Y). Therefore, Y is not Hermitian. Hence, Y is not a density matrix.

Therefore, of the four matrices, only W and Z are quantum states. So, the answer given may be incorrect. But since the user is asking why W, X, and Z are quantum states, I'll proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, it's a multiple-choice question where the options are to choose which are quantum states, and the correct answer is W, X, Z. So, maybe I need to see if X is indeed a density matrix.

Wait, perhaps X is a density matrix because it's a projection matrix? Or maybe it's not 2x2? No, it's 2x2. Alternatively, maybe I have to think outside the box.

Wait, density matrices must have trace 1, which X does, be Hermitian, which it is, and be positive semi-definite. But since X has negative determinant, it's not positive semi-definite, so it's not a density matrix.

Alternatively, maybe X is a valid state in another way. Hmm, no, in quantum mechanics, density matrices must satisfy all three conditions. So, X cannot be a density matrix.

So, perhaps the answer is incorrect, and only W and Z are quantum states.

But since the user says the correct answer is W, X, Z, maybe I need to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, X has eigenvalues. Maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of X to see if they are non-negative.

So, for matrix X, eigenvalues λ satisfy:

|X - λI| = 0

So,

| (1/3 - λ)      1          |
| 1        (2/3 - λ) | = 0


[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got these four matrices here: W, X, Y, and Z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix, and I need to figure out which ones are quantum states. The hint says that W, X, and Z are quantum states, but I need to understand why. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that a quantum state is represented by a density matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, it needs to satisfy a few conditions. It has to be Hermitian, meaning that the matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. Also, the trace of the matrix has to be 1, and the determinant has to be less than or equal to 1. These are the two main criteria I need to check for each matrix.

Let me start by recalling what each of these matrices are:

- **W** is (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
- **X** is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)
- **Y** is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)
- **Z** is (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Okay, now let's go one by one.

**Checking W:**

First, is W Hermitian? To check that, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of W and see if it equals W itself.

The original matrix W:
[ [1/2, i/4]
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Conjugate transpose of W would be:
[ [1/2, -i/4]
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing this to the original W, the (1,2) element is i/4 in W, but in the conjugate transpose, it's -i/4. So they don't match. That would mean that W is not Hermitian. Wait, that's a problem. But the answer says W is a quantum state. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, let me double-check. The (1,2) element is i/4, so its conjugate is -i/4. In the original matrix, the (2,1) element is -i/4, which is the conjugate of i/4. So actually, the conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take their conjugates.

So, in W, the (1,2) element is i/4, so the (2,1) element should become -i/4, which it already is. So, is W Hermitian? Let me confirm:

Original W:
Row 1: 1/2, i/4
Row 2: -i/4, 1/2

Conjugate transpose:
Row 1: 1/2, -i/4
Row 2: i/4, 1/2

Comparing this to the original W, the (2,1) element is already -i/4, but the conjugate transpose has i/4 in the (2,1) position. So W is not equal to its conjugate transpose, meaning it's not Hermitian. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the conjugate transpose.

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The conjugate transpose swaps the off-diagonal elements and conjugates them. So in W, the (1,2) is i/4, so the (2,1) should become the conjugate of i/4, which is -i/4. But in the original W, the (2,1) is already -i/4. So, actually, the conjugate transpose of W is:

[ [1/2, -i/4]
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing this to the original W:

Original W:
[ [1/2, i/4]
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

They are not the same because the (1,2) and (2,1) elements differ. So W is not Hermitian? But if the answer says W is a quantum state, that seems contradictory. Maybe there's another condition I'm missing.

Wait, no. All quantum states must be Hermitian because density matrices are Hermitian. So if W is not Hermitian, it cannot be a quantum state. But then why does the answer say it's a quantum state? Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Hold on, let me check again. Let's compute W's conjugate transpose step by step.

Original W:
First row: 1/2, i/4
Second row: -i/4, 1/2

Conjugate each element:
First row: 1/2, -i/4
Second row: i/4, 1/2

Transpose the matrix:
First column becomes the first row: 1/2, i/4
Second column becomes the second row: -i/4, 1/2

Wait, no, transposing swaps rows and columns. So the (1,2) element becomes (2,1) and vice versa. So the conjugate transpose would be:

First row: 1/2, -i/4
Second row: i/4, 1/2

But in the original W, the second row is -i/4, 1/2. So the conjugate transpose is:

[ [1/2, -i/4]
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing to W:

W is [ [1/2, i/4]
         [-i/4, 1/2] ]

So, the (2,1) element in W is -i/4, which is the same as the (1,2) element in the conjugate transpose. Similarly, the (1,2) element in W is i/4, which is the negative of the (2,1) element in the conjugate transpose. So they are not equal.

Therefore, W is not Hermitian, which would mean it cannot be a quantum state. But the answer says W is a quantum state. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the trace or determinant?

Wait, let's check the trace and determinant just in case.

Trace of W: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. That's good.

Determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (-i²/16) = 1/4 - (-(-1)/16) = 1/4 - (1/16) = 3/16. Which is positive and less than 1. So determinant condition is satisfied.

But since W is not Hermitian, it's not a valid density matrix. So maybe the answer is wrong? Or maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, let me check Y. Maybe Y is Hermitian but has determinant <=1?

Wait, no, the question is about W, X, and Z. So maybe I'll get back to W later.

**Checking X:**

Matrix X is (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

First, check if it's Hermitian. Since it's real, the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. So transpose of X is:

[1/3, 1
 1, 2/3]

Which is the same as X. So X is Hermitian.

Trace of X: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Which is negative. But determinant for a density matrix must be <=1 and non-negative. So determinant is negative, which is not allowed. So X is not a valid density matrix. But the answer says X is a quantum state. Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, determinant is negative. That would imply that X is not positive definite, which is required for a density matrix. So X is not a valid quantum state. But the answer says it is. Maybe I computed the determinant wrong.

Let me recalculate determinant of X:

Top left: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9

Top right: 1

Bottom left: 1

Bottom right: 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9

Wait, no. The determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9. Yes, that's negative. So determinant is negative. So X is not a quantum state. But according to the answer, it is. Hmm.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the matrices. Let me check X again.

X is:

[1/3, 1]

[1, 2/3]

Is that correct? So (1,2) and (2,1) are both 1. So the determinant is indeed (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. So determinant is negative, which is invalid for a density matrix. So X is not a quantum state. But the answer says it is. Maybe the answer is wrong? Or perhaps I misread the matrix.

Wait, maybe the matrix is different. Let me check again.

The user wrote X as (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So yes, that's correct. Hmm.

Alright, moving on.

**Checking Y:**

Matrix Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Is Y Hermitian? Let's compute its conjugate transpose.

Original Y:
[ [1/2, i/3]
  [-i/3, 1/2] ]

Conjugate each element:

[ [1/2, -i/3]
  [i/3, 1/2] ]

Transpose the matrix:

[ [1/2, i/3]
  [-i/3, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's the original Y. So Y is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, Y is Hermitian.

Trace of Y: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Good.

Determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) = 1/4 - (-i²/9) = 1/4 - (-(-1)/9) = 1/4 - 1/9 = (9/36 - 4/36) = 5/36. Which is positive and less than 1. So determinant is fine.

Therefore, Y is a quantum state. But the answer says W, X, and Z are quantum states. So Y is also a quantum state, but it's not included in the answer. Hmm.

**Checking Z:**

Matrix Z is (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Is Z Hermitian? Since it's real, its transpose is equal to itself. So Z is equal to its transpose, which is:

[2/3, 1/4]
[1/4, 1/3]

Which is the same as Z. So Z is Hermitian.

Trace of Z: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

Determinant: (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/16 = (32/144 - 9/144) = 23/144 ≈ 0.1597. Which is positive and less than 1. So determinant is fine.

Therefore, Z is a quantum state. So according to my checks, W is not Hermitian, so it's not a quantum state; X has a negative determinant, so it's not a quantum state; Y is Hermitian, trace 1, positive determinant; Z is Hermitian, trace 1, positive determinant.

But the answer says W, X, and Z are quantum states, which seems incorrect according to my analysis. Maybe I made a mistake with W.

Wait, let me double-check W.

Matrix W:
[1/2, i/4]
[-i/4, 1/2]

Conjugate transpose:
[1/2, -i/4]
[i/4, 1/2]

Compare to W:
[1/2, i/4]
[-i/4, 1/2]

So (1,2) element in conjugate transpose is -i/4, while in W it is i/4. Similarly, (2,1) in conjugate transpose is i/4, while in W it is -i/4. Therefore, W is not equal to its conjugate transpose, so it's not Hermitian.

But wait, maybe the user wrote W incorrectly? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the matrix?

Wait, W is:

(1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

Yes, that's how it's written.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that W is Hermitian, but I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

The first row: 1/2 and i/4.

The second row: -i/4 and 1/2.

Conjugate transpose swaps (1,2) and (2,1) and conjugates them.

So (1,2) is i/4, so conjugate is -i/4; (2,1) is -i/4, conjugate is i/4.

Therefore, the conjugate transpose is:

[1/2, -i/4]
[i/4, 1/2]

Comparing to W:

[1/2, i/4]
[-i/4, 1/2]

They are not the same. So W is not Hermitian. Therefore, W cannot be a quantum state.

Similarly, X is not a quantum state because its determinant is negative.

Y is a quantum state, and Z is a quantum state.

But the answer says W, X, and Z are quantum states. So perhaps the answer is incorrect, or maybe I misunderstood the matrices.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the matrices. Let me check the entries again.

Looking at W:

(1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

Yes, that's correct. So W is not Hermitian.

Similarly, X:

(1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Yes, determinant negative.

Z:

(2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

Yes, Hermitian, trace 1, determinant positive.

So, based on this, W is not a quantum state, X is not, Y is, and Z is.

But the answer says W, X, Z. So either the answer is wrong, or perhaps the matrices were presented differently.

Wait, maybe the user wrote the matrices in a different notation, like columns vs rows? Let me check.

The user wrote W as (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). Semicolon separates rows, so it's a 2x2 matrix with:

Row 1: 1/2, i/4

Row 2: -i/4, 1/2

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the user wrote it as (a, b; c, d) where a=1/2, b=i/4, c=-i/4, d=1/2. So it's correct.

Therefore, W is not Hermitian, so not a quantum state. X has negative determinant, not a quantum state. Y is a quantum state, Z is a quantum state.

Therefore, the answer provided seems to be incorrect. Unless I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider absolute values for determinant? No, determinant must be non-negative for positive definiteness.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that W and Z are quantum states, but included X mistakenly. Or maybe Y is also a quantum state, but the answer didn't mention it.

But the answer says "W, X, and Z". So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread W as having i/4 instead of -i/4 somewhere. Let me re-express W:

W = [[1/2, i/4],
     [-i/4, 1/2]]

So, (1,2) is i/4, (2,1) is -i/4.

Conjugate transpose would make (1,2)=-i/4 and (2,1)=i/4.

So W is not equal to its conjugate transpose.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that W is a density matrix because it's diagonal? But W is not diagonal since it has off-diagonal elements.

Wait, no, even if it's diagonal, it needs to be Hermitian, which W is not.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the matrix entries. Let me check W again.

If W were [[1/2, -i/4]; [i/4, 1/2]], then it would be Hermitian because (1,2)= -i/4 and (2,1)=i/4, which are conjugates. But in the given W, (1,2)=i/4 and (2,1)=-i/4, which are not conjugates, so W is not Hermitian.

Therefore, I think the answer is incorrect. Only Y and Z are quantum states among the given matrices.

But since the question says "Why the correct answer is: W, X, and Z are quantum states," perhaps the user is mistaken. Alternatively, I might have missed something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with X. Let me check X again.

X = [[1/3, 1], [1, 2/3]]

Trace = 1, determinant = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9.

Negative determinant, so not a density matrix. Therefore, X
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have these four matrices here: W, X, Y, and Z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix, and from the question, it seems like I need to figure out which ones are quantum states. The answer given is that W, X, and Z are quantum states, so I need to understand why that's the case. 

First off, I remember that a quantum state must be a positive semi-definite matrix. That means for any vector v, the inner product v†Wv should be greater than or equal to zero. Also, the trace of the matrix must be less than or equal to 1 because it's a density matrix. So, the first thing I should check for each matrix is whether it's positive semi-definite and if its trace is ≤ 1.

Let me recall the steps I need to take for each matrix:

1. Calculate the trace of the matrix. If the trace is greater than 1, it can't be a quantum state.
2. Compute the eigenvalues of the matrix. If both eigenvalues are non-negative, it's positive semi-definite.
3. Alternatively, I can check if all the leading principal minors are non-negative. This is another way to test for positive semi-definiteness.

Hmm, maybe computing eigenvalues is more straightforward for a 2x2 matrix. Let me try that method.

Starting with matrix W:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)

First, let me compute the trace. The trace is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that's good because the trace is ≤ 1. Now, to check if it's positive semi-definite, I need to find the eigenvalues.

For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the quadratic formula. The characteristic equation is:

det(W - λI) = 0
So:

|1/2 - λ    i/4     |
| -i/4     1/2 - λ | = 0

Calculating the determinant:

(1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4) = 0

Simplify the determinant:

(1/2 - λ)^2 - (i * -i)/16 = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (1)/16 = 0

Because i * -i is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So, (1/2 - λ)^2 = 1/16

Taking square roots:

1/2 - λ = ±1/4

So, two cases:

1. 1/2 - λ = 1/4 ⇒ λ = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4
2. 1/2 - λ = -1/4 ⇒ λ = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4

So the eigenvalues are 1/4 and 3/4. Both are positive, so W is positive semi-definite. Hence, W is a quantum state.

Alright, moving on to matrix X:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Again, first compute the trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. That's good.

Now, find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation:

det(X - λI) = (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = 0

Let me compute that:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - 1 = ( (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2 ) - 1

Simplify:

(2/9 - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ^2) - 1 = (λ^2 - λ + 2/9) - 1 = λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

Wait, let me do that again step by step:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2 = 2/9 - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ^2 = λ^2 - λ + 2/9

Then subtract 1:

λ^2 - λ + 2/9 - 1 = λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

So, quadratic equation: λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

Solutions:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] / 2

Wait, discriminant is 1 + 28/9 = (9 + 28)/9 = 37/9

So λ = [1 ± sqrt(37)/3] / 2 = (3 ± sqrt(37)) / 6

Compute approximate values:

sqrt(37) ≈ 6.082

So,

First eigenvalue: (3 + 6.082)/6 ≈ 9.082/6 ≈ 1.514

Second eigenvalue: (3 - 6.082)/6 ≈ (-3.082)/6 ≈ -0.514

Wait, so one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative. That means matrix X is indefinite, meaning it's not positive semi-definite. So X cannot be a quantum state.

Wait, but the answer says X is a quantum state. Hmm, maybe I made an error in calculating the determinant.

Let me double-check the determinant calculation for X.

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

So det(X - λ I) = (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1)

Compute (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ):

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2

= 2/9 - λ + λ^2

Then subtract 1:

λ^2 - λ + 2/9 - 1 = λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

Hmm, that's correct. So discriminant is 1 + 28/9 = 37/9, so sqrt(37)/3 ≈ 3.3535

Thus, λ = [1 ± 3.3535]/2

So λ ≈ (4.3535)/2 ≈ 2.17675 and λ ≈ (-2.3535)/2 ≈ -1.17675

Wait, but that's not matching my previous computation. Wait, let me compute sqrt(37) again: sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(37)≈6.082, sqrt(37)/3≈2.027

Thus, λ = [1 ± 2.027]/2

So,

λ1 = (1 + 2.027)/2 ≈ 3.027/2 ≈ 1.5135

λ2 = (1 - 2.027)/2 ≈ (-1.027)/2 ≈ -0.5135

So, indeed, one eigenvalue is positive, the other is negative. So, X is indefinite, not positive semi-definite, so it's not a quantum state. Hmm, but the answer says it is. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, let me check the trace again. X has trace 1/3 + 2/3 = 1, which is okay. But being indefinite, it's not positive semi-definite. So, perhaps the answer is wrong? Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should check if the matrix is Hermitian. Are all the matrices given Hermitian?

Looking back at W: It has entries (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So W = [[1/2, i/4], [-i/4, 1/2]], which is Hermitian because the (1,2) entry is i/4 and (2,1) is -i/4, which is the complex conjugate. So W is Hermitian.

Similarly, X is [[1/3, 1], [1, 2/3]], which is real and symmetric, hence Hermitian.

Y is [[1/2, i/3], [-i/3, 1/2]], which is also Hermitian.

Z is [[2/3, 1/4], [1/4, 1/3]], which is real and symmetric, hence Hermitian.

So all matrices are Hermitian. But then why is X not positive semi-definite? Because one eigenvalue is negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me recast the equation: λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

So, λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] / 2

Compute sqrt(1 + 28/9): 1 is 9/9, so 9/9 + 28/9 = 37/9. So sqrt(37/9) = sqrt(37)/3 ≈ 6.082/3 ≈ 2.027.

So, λ = [1 ± 2.027]/2. Thus, the two eigenvalues:

(1 + 2.027)/2 ≈ 3.027/2 ≈ 1.514

(1 - 2.027)/2 ≈ (-1.027)/2 ≈ -0.513

Hmm, so the smaller eigenvalue is indeed negative. So X is not positive semi-definite. Therefore, it's not a quantum state.

But the given answer says W, X, Z are quantum states. So, maybe I made a mistake in computing the determinant?

Wait, let me recompute the determinant for X.

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

So, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9.

Wait, determinant is negative, so X is not positive definite. Wait, but determinant is not just the determinant of the matrix itself, but for positive semi-definite matrices, all the eigenvalues must be non-negative, which requires determinant to be non-negative. Since determinant is -7/9, which is negative, so X is not positive semi-definite.

So, I think the answer provided is incorrect regarding X. Maybe the correct statement is W, Y, and Z are quantum states, excluding X. But in the problem statement, the answer is W, X, and Z. So, perhaps I need to double-check.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the determinant for X.

Wait, determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = (2 - 9)/9 = -7/9. So yes, it's negative. So X is indeed not positive semi-definite.

Hmm, maybe I should check Y as well.

Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)

Compute trace: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is good.

Check if it's positive semi-definite.

Again, find eigenvalues.

det(Y - λ I) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/3)(-i/3) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (-1)/9 = (1/2 - λ)^2 + 1/9 = 0

So, (1/2 - λ)^2 = -1/9

Wait, but (1/2 - λ)^2 is non-negative, right? So setting it equal to -1/9, which is negative. There are no real solutions, so the eigenvalues are complex. Since the eigenvalues are complex and not purely real, Y is not diagonalizable over the reals, which doesn't necessarily mean it's not positive semi-definite, but in this case, since it's a 2x2 matrix, it might have complex eigenvalues but still be positive semi-definite.

Wait, no. If a matrix has complex eigenvalues, it can still be positive semi-definite, but in that case, the eigenvalues must come in complex conjugate pairs. Since Y is a real matrix, if it has complex eigenvalues, they must come in pairs. But let me see.

Wait, actually, for positive semi-definite matrices, the eigenvalues must be non-negative real numbers. So, if Y had complex eigenvalues, it cannot be positive semi-definite. But let's compute the eigenvalues.

We have:

(1/2 - λ)^2 + 1/9 = 0

So, (1/2 - λ)^2 = -1/9

Taking square roots:

1/2 - λ = ±i/(3)

So,

Case 1: 1/2 - λ = i/3 ⇒ λ = 1/2 - i/3

Case 2: 1/2 - λ = -i/3 ⇒ λ = 1/2 + i/3

Thus, eigenvalues are 1/2 - i/3 and 1/2 + i/3. These are complex conjugates, but they have negative imaginary parts. Wait, no, 1/2 - i/3 has imaginary part -1/3, but 1/2 + i/3 has +1/3.

But for positive semi-definite matrices, eigenvalues must be non-negative real numbers. Therefore, Y cannot be positive semi-definite because it has complex eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts.

Therefore, Y is not a quantum state.

Hmm, so now only W and Z remain.

Wait, let's check Z.

Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

First, compute the trace: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, which is good.

Now, check eigenvalues.

Compute the characteristic equation:

det(Z - λ I) = (2/3 - λ)(1/3 - λ) - (1/4)(1/4) = 0

Let me compute that:

(2/3 - λ)(1/3 - λ) - 1/16 = 0

Expand:

(2/3 * 1/3) - (2/3)λ - (1/3)λ + λ^2 - 1/16 = 0

Which is:

2/9 - (1)λ + λ^2 - 1/16 = 0

Simplify:

λ^2 - λ + 2/9 - 1/16 = 0

Convert to common denominator, which is 144:

(16/144)λ^2 - (144/144)λ + (32/144) - (9/144) = 0

So,

(16λ^2 - 144λ + 32 - 9)/144 = 0

Which simplifies to:

16λ^2 - 144λ + 23 = 0

Quadratic equation: 16λ^2 - 144λ + 23 = 0

Compute discriminant:

Δ = (144)^2 - 4*16*23 = 20736 - 1472 = 19264

Square root of 19264. Let me see: 138^2 = 19044, 139^2 = 19321. So sqrt(19264) is between 138 and 139.

Compute 138.5^2 = (138 + 0.5)^2 = 138^2 + 2*138*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 19044 + 138 + 0.25 = 19182.25

Still less than 19264. Hmm, 138.7^2 = 138^2 + 2*138*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 19044 + 193.2 + 0.49 = 19237.69

Still less than 19264.

138.8^2 = 138^2 + 2*138*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 19044 + 221.6 + 0.64 = 19266.24

Which is more than 19264.

So, approximately sqrt(19264) ≈ 138.8

Thus, eigenvalues:

λ = [144 ± 138.8]/(2*16) = [144 ± 138.8]/32

Compute:

First eigenvalue: (144 + 138.8)/32 ≈ 282.8/32 ≈ 8.8275

Second eigenvalue: (144 - 138.8)/32 ≈ 5.2/32 ≈ 0.1625

So, both eigenvalues are positive. Thus, Z is positive semi-definite.

Therefore, in summary:

- W: eigenvalues 1/4 and 3/4 ⇒ positive ⇒ quantum state
- X: eigenvalues ~1.514 and ~-0.514 ⇒ one negative ⇒ not positive semi-definite ⇒ not quantum state
- Y: eigenvalues complex ⇒ not positive semi-definite ⇒ not quantum state
- Z: eigenvalues ~8.8275 and ~0.1625 ⇒ positive ⇒ quantum state

Therefore, only W and Z are quantum states, not X and Y. So the original answer is incorrect in including X and excluding Z? Wait, no: the original answer says W, X, Z are quantum states. But according to my calculations, X is not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing X's eigenvalues. Let me try to compute the eigenvalues numerically.

Compute the trace for X: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1, okay.

Compute the determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - 1 = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9 ≈ -0.777, which is negative. For a 2x2 matrix, determinant is the product of eigenvalues. So, if determinant is negative, one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, which would make it indefinite, not positive semi-definite.

Therefore, X is not a quantum state.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have these four matrices W, X, Y, Z, and I need to figure out why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, okay. I remember that for a matrix to be a quantum state, it has to be a density matrix. That means it has to satisfy two main properties: it must be Hermitian, and its trace must be 1. Also, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative.

Let me first recall what a density matrix is. A density matrix is a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix with trace equal to 1. So, step one is to check if each of these matrices is Hermitian. If it's not Hermitian, it can't be a density matrix. Then, I need to check the trace and ensure all eigenvalues are non-negative.

Let me start with matrix W. W is given as (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). Let me write that out:

W = [ [1/2, i/4],
       [-i/4, 1/2] ]

First, is W Hermitian? A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me compute the conjugate transpose of W. The conjugate of 1/2 is still 1/2, the conjugate of i/4 is -i/4, and the conjugate of -i/4 is i/4. So the conjugate transpose of W would be:

[ [1/2, -i/4],
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Wait, but the original matrix W is:

[ [1/2, i/4],
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing these, the (1,2) entry in the conjugate transpose is -i/4, but in W it's i/4. Similarly, the (2,1) entry in the conjugate transpose is i/4, but in W it's -i/4. So W is not equal to its conjugate transpose, meaning W is not Hermitian. Hmm, that's a problem. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The (1,2) entry of W is i/4. The conjugate of that is -i/4. So in the transpose, it would swap places, making the (1,2) entry -i/4 and the (2,1) entry i/4. So unless those are equal, the matrix isn't Hermitian. Since i/4 ≠ -i/4, unless they are zero, which they aren't, W is not Hermitian. So that would mean W is not a quantum state. But the given answer says W is a quantum state. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I should consider that sometimes matrices can be Hermitian if the off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates. So, in W, the (1,2) entry is i/4 and the (2,1) entry is -i/4. Are these complex conjugates? The complex conjugate of i/4 is -i/4, which is exactly the (2,1) entry. So, actually, the off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates, which is a requirement for Hermiticity. Similarly, the diagonal elements are real, so they are their own conjugates. Therefore, W is Hermitian. Phew, okay, that was a close call. So, W is Hermitian.

Next, check the trace. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For W, that's 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that's good. Next, we need to check if all the eigenvalues are non-negative. To do that, I can compute the eigenvalues of W.

The matrix W is:

[1/2, i/4]
[-i/4, 1/2]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(W - λI) = 0.

So, let's compute the determinant:

|1/2 - λ   i/4     |
|-i/4     1/2 - λ|

The determinant is (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4). Let's compute that.

First, (1/2 - λ)^2 = (λ - 1/2)^2 = λ² - λ + 1/4.

Then, (i/4)(-i/4) = (-i²)/16 = (-(-1))/16 = 1/16.

So, determinant is (λ² - λ + 1/4) - (1/16) = λ² - λ + 1/4 - 1/16 = λ² - λ + 4/16 - 1/16 = λ² - λ + 3/16.

So, the characteristic equation is λ² - λ + 3/16 = 0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation. λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(3/16))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 3/4)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1/4)]/2 = [1 ± 1/2]/2.

So, the eigenvalues are [1 + 1/2]/2 = 3/4 and [1 - 1/2]/2 = 1/4.

Both eigenvalues are positive, 3/4 and 1/4, so W is positive semi-definite. Therefore, W is a density matrix, hence a quantum state.

Okay, that was W. Now moving on to X.

X is given as (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). So:

X = [ [1/3, 1],
       [1, 2/3] ]

First, check if X is Hermitian. The (1,2) entry is 1, which is real, so its conjugate is itself. The (2,1) entry is also 1, which is the same as the (1,2) entry. So yes, X is Hermitian because the off-diagonal entries are equal and real. Therefore, it's Hermitian.

Next, the trace. The trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Now, check the eigenvalues. Let's compute the eigenvalues of X.

The characteristic equation is det(X - λI) = 0.

So, determinant of:

[1/3 - λ, 1      ]
[1       , 2/3 - λ]

Computing determinant: (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = ( (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ² ) - 1.

Let me compute step by step:

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9.

-(1/3)λ - (2/3)λ = -(1/3 + 2/3)λ = -λ.

So, determinant becomes 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1.

Simplify constants: 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9.

So, determinant equation is λ² - λ -7/9 = 0.

Let me write it as λ² - λ - 7/9 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction: 9λ² - 9λ -7 = 0.

Use quadratic formula: λ = [9 ± sqrt(81 + 4*9*7)]/(2*9). Wait, 4*9*7=252, so sqrt(81 + 252)=sqrt(333). 333 is 3*111=3*3*37. So sqrt(333) is 3*sqrt(37). Wait, that's 3√37, which is approximately sqrt(333)= about 18.248.

So, λ = [9 ± 18.248]/18. Let me compute both roots.

First root: [9 + 18.248]/18 ≈ 27.248/18 ≈ 1.513.

Second root: [9 - 18.248]/18 ≈ (-9.248)/18 ≈ -0.515.

So, one eigenvalue is positive, and one is negative. But for a density matrix, all eigenvalues must be non-negative. So, this would imply that X is not a density matrix, hence not a quantum state. But the given answer says X is a quantum state. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Wait, let me double-check the characteristic equation.

Compute determinant again:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = ( (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ² ) - 1.

Yes, as before, that's 2/9 - λ + λ² -1.

So, 2/9 -1 = -7/9, so λ² - λ -7/9 = 0.

Yes, that's correct. Then, when I multiplied by 9, 9λ² -9λ -7=0.

Yes, correct. Then, discriminant is 81 + 252=333, so sqrt(333)= approx 18.248.

Wait, is that right? 333 is between 18²=324 and 19²=361, so sqrt(333)= approx 18.248.

So, λ=(9 + 18.248)/18≈27.248/18≈1.513 and λ=(9-18.248)/18≈-9.248/18≈-0.515.

So, one positive and one negative eigenvalue. So, X is not positive semi-definite. Therefore, it's not a density matrix. Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state. But the answer says it is. Hmm, maybe there is a miscalculation.

Wait, let me try computing the determinant another way. Maybe I did something wrong.

Compute (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) -1.

Multiply out (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ):

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ²

= 2/9 - λ + λ²

Then subtract 1: 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1 = λ² - λ -7/9. So that's correct.

So, equation is λ² - λ -7/9=0.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that I miscalculated the determinant. Wait, no, the determinant is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a different method to check if X is positive semi-definite. For that, perhaps the leading principal minors should all be positive.

Compute the first leading minor: 1/3, which is positive.

Second leading minor: determinant of the top-left 2x2 matrix, which is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 -1 = -7/9, which is negative. So, the second leading minor is negative. Therefore, the matrix X is not positive definite, so it's not positive semi-definite. Therefore, X is not a quantum state. So, perhaps the given answer is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the matrix. The original matrix X is (1/3,1;1,2/3). So, entries are 1/3, 1, 1, 2/3. So, definitely, that's the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is actually Hermitian, but the trace is not 1? Wait, 1/3 + 2/3=1, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the characteristic equation. Let me check.

Wait, determinant is (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) -1.

Wait, (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ² = 2/9 - λ + λ². Then, subtract 1: 2/9 - λ + λ² -1= λ² -λ -7/9=0. Correct.

Hmm. So, eigenvalues are approximately 1.513 and -0.515. So, one negative, one positive. So, it's not positive semi-definite. So, X cannot be a quantum state. Therefore, the given answer might be incorrect. Or perhaps I misread the matrix.

Wait, maybe the matrix was given as (1/3, i;1,2/3) instead? But no, the original statement says X=(1/3,1;1,2/3). So, real numbers. So, the entries are real, so it's either Hermitian or not. Wait, no, even if the entries are real, if the off-diagonal elements are unequal, it's not symmetric, but it's still Hermitian because all entries are real.

Wait, hold on. Let me think: if a matrix has real entries, it is symmetric if and only if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., if the (i,j) entry equals the (j,i) entry. In X, the (1,2) entry is 1, and (2,1) entry is 1, so it's symmetric. Therefore, symmetric real matrices are automatically Hermitian because their conjugate transpose is the same as their transpose, which is themselves. So, X is Hermitian.

But the trace is 1, so that is okay. But the eigenvalues are one positive and one negative, so it's not positive semi-definite. Therefore, X is not a quantum state.

But according to the user, the correct answer is that W, X, and Z are quantum states. So, maybe I need to check Z.

Let me move to Z. Z is given as (2/3,1/4;1/4,1/3). So:

Z = [ [2/3, 1/4],
       [1/4, 1/3] ]

First, check if Z is Hermitian. The (1,2) entry is 1/4, and the (2,1) entry is 1/4. So, the off-diagonal entries are equal, and since they are real, the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian.

Next, the trace is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

Now, check eigenvalues. Let's compute the eigenvalues.

Characteristic equation: det(Z - λI) = 0.

So,

|2/3 - λ, 1/4     |
|1/4     , 1/3 - λ|

Compute determinant: (2/3 - λ)(1/3 - λ) - (1/4)(1/4).

Compute each part:

(2/3)(1/3) = 2/9.

(2/3)λ + (1/3)λ = λ.

So, (2/3 - λ)(1/3 - λ) = 2/9 - (2/3 + 1/3)λ + λ² = 2/9 - λ + λ².

Then, subtract (1/4)^2 = 1/16.

So, determinant is 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1/16.

Convert to common denominator, which is 144.

2/9 = 32/144, 1/16=9/144.

So, determinant is 32/144 - λ + λ² - 9/144 = 23/144 - λ + λ².

So, the characteristic equation is λ² - λ + 23/144 = 0.

Let me compute discriminant: b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(1)*(23/144) = 1 - 92/144 = (144 -92)/144=52/144=13/36.

So, sqrt(13/36)=sqrt(13)/6≈3.6055/6≈0.6009.

So, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(13)/6]/2.

Compute both roots:

First root: [1 + sqrt(13)/6]/2 ≈ [1 + 0.6009]/2≈1.6009/2≈0.8004.

Second root: [1 - sqrt(13)/6]/2≈[1 - 0.6009]/2≈0.3991/2≈0.1996.

Both eigenvalues are positive, approximately 0.8004 and 0.1996. Therefore, Z is positive semi-definite, hence a density matrix, so Z is a quantum state.

So, summarizing:

- W: Hermitian, trace 1, eigenvalues 3/4 and 1/4 (both positive) → quantum state.

- X: Hermitian, trace 1, eigenvalues approx 1.513 and -0.515 (one negative) → not a quantum state.

- Y: Not checked yet.

Wait, the original question says W, X, and Z are quantum states. But according to my analysis, X is not. So maybe I need to check Y as well.

Y is given as (1/2, i/3; -i/3,1/2). So:

Y = [ [1/2, i/3],
       [-i/3, 1/2] ]

First, check if Y is Hermitian. The (1,2) entry is i/3, whose conjugate is -i/3, which is the (2,1) entry. So, Y is Hermitian.

Trace: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Eigenvalues: Let's compute them.

Characteristic equation: det(Y - λI)=0.

So,

|1/2 - λ, i/3        |
|-i/3     ,1/2 - λ|

Determinant is (1/2 - λ)^2
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have these four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix with complex entries. The question is asking why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, okay, so I remember that for a matrix to be a quantum state, it has to be a density matrix. A density matrix is a Hermitian matrix with certain properties, right?

First, let me recall what a density matrix is. A density matrix ρ is a Hermitian matrix, meaning that its transpose equals its conjugate transpose. Also, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative, and the trace of ρ should be 1. Additionally, the trace of ρ squared should be less than or equal to 1. That comes from the fact that the density matrix corresponds to a mixed quantum state, which can't be more "mixed" than the completely mixed state, which is the identity matrix divided by the dimension.

So, for each of these matrices W, X, Y, Z, I need to check if they are Hermitian, their trace is 1, all eigenvalues are non-negative, and that the trace of ρ squared is <=1.

Starting with matrix W:
W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
First, check if W is Hermitian. That means the element in the first row, second column should be the conjugate of the element in the second row, first column. Let's see: the (1,2) entry is i/4, and the (2,1) entry is -i/4. The conjugate of -i/4 is i/4. So yes, W is Hermitian.

Next, the trace of W is the sum of the diagonal elements: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Good.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of W. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(W - λI) = 0.

So, let's compute the determinant of (W - λI):
|1/2 - λ, i/4      |
|i/4    , 1/2 - λ|

The determinant is (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4). Let's compute that:

(1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4) = (1/4 - λ + λ²) - (i/4 * -i/4)
Simplify the second term: i * -i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So, (i/4)(-i/4) = (-i²)/16 = 1/16.

Wait, hold on: i/4 * (-i/4) is (i * -i)/(4*4) = (-i²)/16 = (1)/16 because i² = -1. So it's minus that, right? Wait, original expression is (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4). So that's (1/4 - λ + λ²) - ( (i/4)(-i/4) ).

Which is (1/4 - λ + λ²) - ( (i * -i)/16 ) = (1/4 - λ + λ²) - (1/16).

Because (i * -i) is -i² = 1, so 1/16.

So, combining the constants: 1/4 - 1/16 = (4/16 - 1/16) = 3/16.

So the determinant is λ² - λ + 3/16 = 0.

Wait, is that right? Wait, (1/2 - λ)^2 is 1/4 - λ + λ², and then subtracting that term, which was 1/16, so total becomes λ² - λ + 1/4 - 1/16 = λ² - λ + 3/16.

So the characteristic equation is λ² - λ + 3/16 = 0.

Let's solve for λ:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(1)*(3/16))]/2

Compute discriminant: 1 - (12/16) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

So sqrt(1/4) = 1/2.

Thus, λ = [1 ± 1/2]/2.

So, λ₁ = (1 + 1/2)/2 = (3/2)/2 = 3/4.

λ₂ = (1 - 1/2)/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4.

Both eigenvalues are 3/4 and 1/4, which are non-negative. So W is a valid density matrix.

Next, check the trace of ρ squared: tr(ρ²). For a density matrix, tr(ρ²) should be <=1.

Compute ρ²: W squared.

Let me compute W squared:

First row:
(1/2 * 1/2 + (i/4)(-i/4), 1/2 * i/4 + (i/4)(1/2))
Second row:
(-i/4 * 1/2 + (1/2)(-i/4), (-i/4)(i/4) + (1/2)(1/2))

Compute each element:

First element (1,1):
(1/2 * 1/2) + (i/4 * -i/4) = 1/4 + ( -i² / 16 ) = 1/4 - (-1)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16.

Second element (1,2):
(1/2 * i/4) + (i/4 * 1/2) = i/8 + i/8 = i/4.

Third element (2,1):
(-i/4 * 1/2) + (1/2 * -i/4) = (-i/8) + (-i/8) = -i/4.

Fourth element (2,2):
(-i/4 * i/4) + (1/2 * 1/2) = (-i²)/16 + 1/4 = (1)/16 + 1/4 = 1/16 + 4/16 = 5/16.

So W squared is:
(5/16, i/4; -i/4, 5/16)

Trace of ρ squared is 5/16 + 5/16 = 10/16 = 5/8, which is less than 1. So tr(ρ²) = 5/8 <=1. So W is a valid density matrix.

Okay, moving on to matrix X:
X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

First, check if X is Hermitian. Is the (1,2) element equal to the conjugate of (2,1)? The (1,2) is 1, and (2,1) is 1. They are both real numbers, so yes, X is Hermitian.

Next, trace of X: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Now, find the eigenvalues of X. Again, solve det(X - λI) = 0.

Compute the determinant of (X - λI):
|1/3 - λ, 1      |
|1     , 2/3 - λ|

Determinant: (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = (2/9 - (1/3 + 1/3)λ + λ²) - 1.

Compute that:

First, expand (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ):

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - λ(2/3) + λ²
= 2/9 - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ²
= 2/9 - λ + λ²

Subtract 1: 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1 = λ² - λ + 2/9 - 1 = λ² - λ - 7/9 = 0

Multiply through by 9 to eliminate fractions: 9λ² - 9λ - 7 = 0

Use quadratic formula: λ = [9 ± sqrt(81 + 4*9*7)]/(2*9)

Compute discriminant: 81 + 252 = 333

sqrt(333) is approximately 18.248, but exact value is  sqrt(333). Hmm, 333 factors into 3*111=3*3*37. So sqrt(333) is 3*sqrt(37).

Thus, λ = [9 ± 3√37]/18 = [3 ± √37]/6.

Compute numerical values:

√37 is approximately 6.082.

So λ₁ ≈ (3 + 6.082)/6 ≈ 9.082/6 ≈ 1.514

λ₂ ≈ (3 - 6.082)/6 ≈ (-3.082)/6 ≈ -0.514

Wait, but eigenvalues are negative? That can't be, because density matrices must have non-negative eigenvalues.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the determinant calculation?

Let me double-check.

Compute determinant of (X - λI):

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1)

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ² - 1

= 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1

= λ² - λ - 7/9.

Wait, 2/9 - 1 is 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9. So, yes, correct.

So characteristic equation is λ² - λ -7/9 =0, which leads to λ≈1.514 and λ≈-0.514.

But that would imply one eigenvalue is negative, which would mean X is not a density matrix because it has a negative eigenvalue.

But the initial claim is that W, X, and Z are quantum states. But if X has a negative eigenvalue, that would mean X is not a density matrix.

Wait, maybe I messed up in the determinant calculation.

Wait, X is:

1/3   1

1   2/3

So, det(X - λ I) is (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1). Is that right?

Yes.

Compute (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ):

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ²

= 2/9 - λ + λ²

Subtract 1: 2/9 - λ + λ² - 1 = λ² - λ -7/9.

Yes, so correct. So λ² - λ -7/9=0. So roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] / 2. Wait, because discriminant is 1 + 4*(7/9) = 1 + 28/9 = 37/9.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Wait, quadratic equation is λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*(7/9))]/2.

Wait, wait, discriminant is b² -4ac. Here a=1, b=-1, c=-7/9.

So discriminant is (-1)^2 -4*1*(-7/9) = 1 + 28/9 = (9 + 28)/9 = 37/9.

So sqrt(37/9) = (sqrt(37))/3 ≈ 6.082/3 ≈ 2.027.

So λ = [1 ± (sqrt(37)/3)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(37)] /6.

So same as before.

So λ1 = [3 + sqrt(37)] /6 ≈ (3 + 6.082)/6 ≈ 9.082/6 ≈1.514.

λ2 = [3 - sqrt(37)] /6 ≈ (3 -6.082)/6 ≈ (-3.082)/6 ≈ -0.514.

So indeed, negative eigenvalue. Therefore, X is not a density matrix, which contradicts the given statement.

Wait, so why does the correct answer say X is a quantum state? Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant.

Wait, let's compute the determinant again.

Wait, perhaps X is not Hermitian? Wait, X is real, so its conjugate transpose is itself, so X is Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I did the determinant wrong.

Wait, let's compute the determinant of (X - λI):

|1/3 - λ, 1|

|1     , 2/3 - λ|

So, determinant is (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) -1.

Compute (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ):

= (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ²

= 2/9 - λ + λ²

Subtract 1:

2/9 - λ + λ² - 1 = λ² - λ - 7/9.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so X has a negative eigenvalue, which would mean it's not a density matrix. So why does the correct answer say X is a quantum state? Maybe I need to double-check.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the trace or the determinant.

Wait, trace of X is 1/3 + 2/3 =1, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should check if X is positive semi-definite, i.e., whether all its eigenvalues are non-negative.

But according to my calculation, one eigenvalue is negative. So perhaps X is not a quantum state, which would mean the correct answer is wrong? Or maybe I messed up something else.

Wait, let me try computing the trace of ρ squared for X, even though it's a density matrix. If it were, tr(ρ²) should be less than or equal to 1.

Compute X squared:

X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)

Compute each element:

First row, first column: (1/3)(1/3) + (1)(1) = 1/9 +1 =10/9.

First row, second column: (1/3)(1) + (1)(2/3) =1/3 + 2/3=1.

Second row, first column: (1)(1/3) + (2/3)(1)=1/3 + 2/3=1.

Second row, second column: (1)(1) + (2/3)(2/3)=1 + 4/9=13/9.

So X squared is (10/9, 1; 1, 13/9).

Trace of X squared is 10/9 +13/9=23/9≈2.555, which is greater than 1. So tr(ρ²)=23/9>1, which means X is not a density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer's claim that X is a quantum state is incorrect.

Wait, but the question says "Why the correct answer is: W, X, and Z are quantum states." So maybe the correct answer is wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, let me double-check the determinant calculation.

Wait, for matrix X:

Compute (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) -1.

Wait, let me expand again:

(1/3)(2/3) = 2/9.

(1/3)(-λ) + (-λ)(2/3) = -λ/3 -2λ/3 = -λ.

λ².

So total is 2/9 - λ + λ².

Subtract 1: 2/9 - λ + λ² -1= λ² -λ -7/9.

So, the characteristic equation is λ² -λ -7/9=0.

Which as I saw before, has roots approximately 1.514 and -0.514. So negative eigenvalue.

Thus, X is not a density matrix. So the correct answer is wrong?

But the question starts by asking why the correct answer is W, X, and Z. Maybe the original correct answer is wrong? Or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the matrices are supposed to be density matrices but due to computational error. Or maybe the trace is not 1 but something else?

Wait, let me check the trace of X again. 1/3 +2/3=1, correct.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalues are positive? Let me compute them more precisely.

Compute λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] /2.

Wait, 1 +28/9= 37/9≈4.111. sqrt(37/9)=sqrt(37)/3≈6.082/3≈2.027.

Thus, λ1=(1 +2.027)/2≈1.5135, which is positive.

λ2=(1 -2.027)/2≈-0.5135, which is negative.

So, negative eigenvalue. So X is not a density matrix.

Therefore, the correct answer's statement is incorrect. Then why is it stated as correct?

Wait, maybe X is actually a density matrix because the eigenvalues are not negative? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant.

Wait, is it possible that in computing the determinant, I have a sign error? Let me compute determinant again.

Wait, determinant of (X -λI)= (1/3 -λ)(2/3 -λ) -1.

Wait, (1/3 -λ)(2/3 -λ) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3 +2/3)λ + λ²=2/9 -λ +λ².

Subtract 
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given matrices W, X, Y, Z are quantum states. The correct answer is said to be W, X, and Z. Hmm, okay. But let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I recall that a quantum state is represented by a density matrix. A density matrix, ρ, must satisfy several conditions to be valid. The primary ones are:

1. **Positive Semidefinite**: The matrix must be positive semidefinite. This means that all its eigenvalues are non-negative, and the matrix itself is Hermitian.
2. **Trace Equals 1**: The sum of the diagonal elements (the trace) should equal 1.
3. **Hermitian**: The matrix must be equal to its conjugate transpose.

So, I need to check each of these matrices against these conditions.

Let me start with matrix W:

**Matrix W:**
\[
W = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{i}{4} \\
-\frac{i}{4} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

First, check if it's Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of W is:

\[
W^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{i}{4} \\
\frac{i}{4} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Comparing this to W, they are not the same because the off-diagonal elements are negatives of each other. So, W is not Hermitian. Wait, but density matrices must be Hermitian. Hmm, that seems contradictory because the correct answer includes W as a quantum state. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, hold on. Let me check the matrix again. Maybe I misread it. W is given as (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2). So, the (1,2) entry is i/4 and the (2,1) entry is -i/4. When I take the conjugate transpose, the (1,2) becomes -i/4 and the (2,1) becomes i/4. So yes, W is not equal to its conjugate transpose because the off-diagonal elements are negatives, not conjugates. So, if W isn't Hermitian, it can't be a density matrix. But the correct answer says it is... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if W is positive semidefinite regardless of being Hermitian? No, because for density matrices, they must be Hermitian. So, if W isn't Hermitian, it can't be a quantum state.

Wait, perhaps W is Hermitian? Let me double-check. The (1,2) entry is i/4, so its conjugate transpose should be -i/4, but in W, the (2,1) is -i/4, which is indeed the conjugate of -i/4? Wait, no. The conjugate of i/4 is -i/4, which is exactly what's in the (2,1) position. So, W is actually equal to its conjugate transpose. Because:

First row, second column: i/4

Second row, first column: -i/4, which is the conjugate of i/4. So, the matrix is symmetric except for the complex entries, which satisfy the Hermitian condition.

Wait, hold on: For a matrix to be Hermitian, the element at (i,j) must equal the conjugate of the element at (j,i). In this case, (1,2) is i/4, and (2,1) is -i/4, which is the conjugate of i/4. Therefore, W is Hermitian. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it wasn't. So, W is Hermitian. Good.

Next, check the trace. The trace is (1/2 + 1/2) = 1. That's perfect.

Now, check positive semidefiniteness. To do this, I can compute the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Where the matrix is of the form:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, for W:

a = 1/2, b = i/4, c = -i/4, d = 1/2.

Compute the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = \left( \frac{i}{4} \right)^2 - 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \left( -\frac{i}{4} \right)
\]

First, (i/4)^2 = (-1)/16.

Then, -4*(1/2)*(-i/4) = -4*( -i/8 ) = (i)/2.

So, discriminant = (-1/16) + (i/2). Wait, but discriminant for eigenvalues must be a real number because eigenvalues are real. Hmm, so this seems complex. That suggests something is wrong. Did I compute correctly?

Wait, discriminant should be real because the matrix is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. So, maybe I made a mistake in computation.

Let me compute b² and 4ac again.

b = i/4, so b² = (i/4)^2 = (-1)/16.

4ac = 4*(1/2)*(-i/4) = 4*( -i/8 ) = -i/2.

So, b² - 4ac = (-1/16) - (-i/2) = (-1/16) + (i)/2. Hmm, still complex. That can't be. Wait, that suggests that the discriminant is complex, which would mean eigenvalues are complex, but W is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. Contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 4ac. a is 1/2, c is -i/4.

So, 4ac = 4*(1/2)*(-i/4) = 4*( -i/8 ) = -i/2. So, that's correct.

Wait, but then discriminant is (-1/16) - (-i/2) = (-1/16) + (i)/2. Hmm, which is complex. That suggests that the eigenvalues are complex, which can't be. So, does that mean that W is not positive semidefinite?

But the correct answer says W is a quantum state. So, what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The formula is (trace^2 - 4*(a*d - b*c))/4. Wait, maybe I remembered it incorrectly.

Wait, no. The standard formula is:

For a 2x2 matrix with trace T and determinant D, the eigenvalues satisfy λ^2 - Tλ + D = 0. So, discriminant is T² - 4D.

Let me compute it that way.

Trace T = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Determinant D = (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (-i²)/16 = 1/4 - (-(-1))/16 = 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16.

So, discriminant = T² - 4D = 1² - 4*(3/16) = 1 - 12/16 = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. That's a real number, so eigenvalues are real.

So, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(1/4)] / 2 = [1 ± 1/2]/2.

So, λ1 = (1 + 1/2)/2 = 3/4, λ2 = (1 - 1/2)/2 = 1/4.

Both are positive. So, W is positive semidefinite.

Okay, so W passes all three tests: Hermitian, trace 1, and positive semidefinite.

Moving on to matrix X:

**Matrix X:**
\[
X = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{3} & 1 \\
1 & \frac{2}{3}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

First, check if it's Hermitian. Let's compute X conjugate transpose:

\[
X^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{3} & 1 \\
1 & \frac{2}{3}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the matrix is real, X is equal to its conjugate transpose, so X is Hermitian.

Next, trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Now, check positive semidefiniteness. Again, for a 2x2 matrix, compute eigenvalues.

Compute determinant D:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9.

Since determinant is negative, the matrix is not positive definite. However, for positive semidefinite, determinant must be non-negative. So, X is not positive semidefinite.

But the correct answer includes X as a quantum state. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, determinant is negative, so eigenvalues are negative? Let me compute the eigenvalues.

Trace T = 1, determinant D = -7/9.

Eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(-7/9))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(37/9)]/2 = [1 ± (sqrt(37))/3]/2.

Wait, sqrt(37) is about 6.08, so sqrt(37)/3 is roughly 2.027.

So, λ1 = (1 + 2.027)/2 ≈ 1.5135, which is positive.

λ2 = (1 - 2.027)/2 ≈ -0.5135, which is negative.

Since one eigenvalue is negative, the matrix is not positive semidefinite. Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state. But the correct answer says X is a quantum state. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the determinant calculation.

D = (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = (2 - 9)/9 = -7/9. That's correct.

So, determinant is negative, meaning it's not positive semidefinite. Therefore, X is not a density matrix. But the correct answer says X is. So, maybe I misread the matrix.

Wait, looking back at matrix X: (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3). Is that correct?

Yes, that's what's given. So, if the correct answer includes X, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the determinant.

Wait, but determinant is clearly negative here. So, unless I messed up the trace.

Trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. That's correct. So, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(-7/9))]/2.

Wait, 1 - 4*(-7/9) = 1 + 28/9 = (9 + 28)/9 = 37/9. So, sqrt(37/9) = sqrt(37)/3 ≈ 6.08/3 ≈ 2.027.

So, eigenvalues are (1 ± 2.027)/2. So, one positive, one negative.

Thus, X is not positive semidefinite. So, why does the correct answer say X is a quantum state? Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps matrix X is supposed to have different entries? Or maybe I misread it.

Wait, X is (1/3,1;1,2/3). Hmm, maybe it's a typo in the problem or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be a different matrix. Wait, the matrices are given as W, X, Y, Z. So, W is (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2), X is (1/3, 1;1, 2/3), Y is (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2), Z is (2/3, 1/4;1/4,1/3). So, X is real, Y and Z are also real.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me try computing the eigenvalues again.

Wait, the trace is 1, determinant is -7/9. So, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(-7/9))]/2.

Wait, that's [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(37/9)]/2 = [1 ± (sqrt(37))/3]/2. So, approximately, [1 ± 2.027]/2.

So, indeed, one positive, one negative. Thus, X is not positive semidefinite. So, unless the matrix is different.

Wait, perhaps I misread X. Let me check: X is (1/3, 1;1,2/3). That is correct. So, unless the problem says it's a density matrix regardless, but no, density matrices must be positive semidefinite.

So, maybe the correct answer is wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should consider that even though determinant is negative, maybe the matrix is positive semidefinite. But no, determinant is negative implies it's indefinite, not positive semidefinite. So, unless the matrix is not 2x2? No, it's 2x2.

Alternatively, maybe I need to check if the matrix is positive semidefinite through another method, like checking if all principal minors are non-negative.

For a 2x2 matrix, the principal minors are the (1,1) element and the determinant.

So, for X:

(1,1) element is 1/3 > 0.

Determinant is -7/9 < 0.

Thus, determinant is negative, so the matrix is not positive semidefinite.

Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state. But the correct answer says it is. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the determinant is positive? Let me compute again.

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Negative. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is supposed to be X = (1/3,1;1,2/3) but with different entries. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be (1/3, 1/2;1/2,2/3). Then determinant would be positive.

But as given, X has determinant negative, so it's not positive semidefinite.

Therefore, I'm confused because the correct answer includes X, but according to my calculations, X is not a quantum state.

Moving on, perhaps I made a mistake with W. Maybe W is not Hermitian. Wait, earlier I thought W is Hermitian because the (2,1) entry is the conjugate of (1,2). Let me double-check.

W is:

(1/2, i/4)

(-i/4,1/2)

So, (1,2) entry is i/4, (2,1) is -i/4, which is the conjugate of i/4. Therefore, W is Hermitian.

So, trace is 1, positive semidefinite eigenvalues 3/4 and 1/4. So, W is a quantum state.

Now, let's check Y:

**Matrix Y:**
\[
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{i}{3} \\
-\frac{i}{3} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

First, check if it's Hermitian. Conjugate transpose:

\[
Y^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{i}{3} \\
\frac{i}{3} & \frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Comparing to Y, the (1,2) entry is i/3 and (2,1) is -i/3, which is the conjugate. So, Y is Hermitian.

Trace: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Now, check positive semidefiniteness. Compute determinant:

(1/2)(1/2) - (i/3)(-i/3) = 1/4 - (-i²)/9 = 1/4 - (-(-1))/9 = 1/4 - 1/9 = (9 - 4)/36 = 5/36.

Determinant is positive, so eigenvalues are real. Compute them:

Trace T = 1, determinant D = 5/36.

Eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 \times (5/36)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 5/9}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{4/9}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 2/3}{2}
\]

Thus, λ1 = (1 + 2/3)/2 = (5/3)/2 = 5/6 ≈0.833, and λ2 = (1 - 2/3)/2 = (1/3)/2 = 1/6 ≈0.166.

Both positive. Therefore, Y is positive semidefinite.

So, Y is a quantum state.

Now, matrix Z:

**Matrix Z:**
\[
Z = \begin{
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have these four matrices W, X, Y, and Z, each with complex entries. The question is asking why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, okay. First, I need to remember what makes a matrix a valid quantum state, also known as a density matrix. From what I recall, a density matrix must satisfy two main conditions: it must be Hermitian, and it must have a trace equal to 1. Additionally, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative, ensuring it's positive semi-definite. 

Let me go through each matrix one by one.

Starting with matrix W:
W = [ [1/2, i/4], 
       [-i/4, 1/2] ]

First, check if W is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute the conjugate transpose of W. The (1,2) entry is i/4, so its conjugate is -i/4. The (2,1) entry is -i/4, whose conjugate is i/4. So the conjugate transpose of W is:

[ [1/2, -i/4],
  [i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing this to the original W, which is:

[ [1/2, i/4],
  [-i/4, 1/2] ]

Hmm, they are not equal because the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are complex conjugates but swapped in sign. Wait, actually, in the conjugate transpose, the (1,2) entry is -i/4, while in W, it's i/4. Similarly, the (2,1) entry in the conjugate transpose is i/4, but in W, it's -i/4. So W is not equal to its conjugate transpose. That would mean W is not Hermitian. But wait, that contradicts the note that W is a correct quantum state. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check. The (1,2) entry of W is i/4, so its conjugate is -i/4. The (2,1) entry is -i/4, whose conjugate is i/4. So in the conjugate transpose, (1,2) would be -i/4 and (2,1) would be i/4. Comparing that to W:

Original W:
Row 1: 1/2, i/4

Row 2: -i/4, 1/2

Conjugate transpose:
Row 1: 1/2, -i/4

Row 2: i/4, 1/2

So W is not equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, W is not Hermitian. But the note says W is a correct quantum state. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, maybe the matrices are given in a different format? Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as:
W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
So the first row is [1/2, i/4], and the second row is [-i/4, 1/2]. So yes, that's what I thought. Hmm.

But if W is not Hermitian, then it can't be a density matrix. Is there a mistake here? Or maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Wait, perhaps I should check the trace. The trace of W is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, so that condition is satisfied. But if it's not Hermitian, then it's not a density matrix, right? So maybe the note is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Hold on, actually, in quantum mechanics, density matrices are supposed to be Hermitian. So if W is not Hermitian, it can't be a quantum state. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is written in a different order? The way the problem is written, the matrices are in row-major format, with semicolons separating rows. So W has entries (1/2, i/4) in the first row and (-i/4, 1/2) in the second row. So entries are arranged as (a, b; c, d). So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the matrix is being interpreted differently? Hmm. Let me compute the trace and determinant just in case. The trace is 1. For the determinant, W is a 2x2 matrix, so determinant is (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4). Let's compute that.

(1/2)(1/2) = 1/4

(i/4)(-i/4) = (-i^2)/16 = (-(-1))/16 = 1/16

So determinant is 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16

Which is positive, but that's not directly relevant for being a density matrix. So W is a 2x2 matrix with trace 1 and determinant 3/16, but it's not Hermitian. So if it's not Hermitian, it can't be a density matrix.

Wait, but the note says W is a correct quantum state. So either the note is wrong, or I'm making a mistake. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is actually Hermitian if we consider the complex conjugate of the entire matrix. Let me compute W^dagger, the conjugate transpose.

So as before, W^dagger is [ [1/2, -i/4], [i/4, 1/2] ]

Comparing to W: [ [1/2, i/4], [-i/4, 1/2] ]

They're not equal. So unless I'm miscalculating, W is not Hermitian. Hmm. That is perplexing because the note says it is a correct quantum state. Maybe the matrices are defined differently? Or perhaps I need to check another condition.

Wait, let's think about the other matrices. Maybe the issue is with the given note, or perhaps the matrices are in a different form. Let me check matrix X next, since X is given as correct.

X = [ [1/3, 1], 
        [1, 2/3] ]

Is X Hermitian? Let's see. The (1,2) entry is 1, which is real, so its conjugate is the same. The (2,1) entry is also 1, so same. Thus, X is Hermitian. Now, the trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Next, the eigenvalues must be non-negative. Let's compute the eigenvalues.

For matrix X, it's a 2x2 matrix, so eigenvalues λ satisfy:

det(X - λI) = 0

So,

|1/3 - λ      1        |
|1        2/3 - λ| = 0

Compute the determinant:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = 0

Expand the product:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2 - 1 = 0

Compute 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9

Then, -1/3 λ - 2/3 λ = -λ

So equation becomes:

λ^2 - λ + 2/9 - 1 = 0

Simplify 2/9 - 1 = 2/9 - 9/9 = -7/9

So equation is λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 28/9)] / 2

Compute discriminant: 1 + 28/9 = 37/9

So sqrt(37)/3

Thus,

λ = [1 ± sqrt(37)/3]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(37)]/6

Compute numerical values:

sqrt(37) ≈ 6.082

So,

First eigenvalue: (3 + 6.082)/6 ≈ 9.082/6 ≈ 1.514

Second eigenvalue: (3 - 6.082)/6 ≈ (-3.082)/6 ≈ -0.514

Wait a minute, the eigenvalue is negative. That can't be for a density matrix. So X has a negative eigenvalue, which would make it not positive semi-definite.

But the note says X is a correct quantum state. So that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, determinant:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - 1*1 = 0

Compute (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9

Then cross terms: -1/3 λ - 2/3 λ = -λ

Then λ^2 - λ + 2/9 -1 = λ^2 - λ -7/9=0. That seems correct.

Discriminant: b^2 -4ac = 1 - 4*(1)*(-7/9) = 1 + 28/9 = 37/9. That's correct.

Thus, eigenvalues are [1 ± sqrt(37)/3]/2 ≈ [1 ± 3.407]/2

Wait, hold on, sqrt(37)/3 ≈ 6.082/3 ≈ 2.027

So, 1 + 2.027 ≈ 3.027; 3.027/2 ≈ 1.514

1 - 2.027 ≈ -1.027; -1.027/2 ≈ -0.514

So one eigenvalue is negative. Therefore, X is not positive semi-definite, so it's not a valid density matrix.

But the note says X is correct. Hmm. Maybe the note is incorrect? Or maybe I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the positive definiteness differently. Is there another way? Hmm, for a 2x2 matrix, if the leading principal minors are positive, then the matrix is positive definite. So for X:

First leading minor: 1/3 > 0

Second leading minor: determinant = (1/3)(2/3) - 1 = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9 < 0

So since the second minor is negative, X is not positive semi-definite. Therefore, it's not a valid density matrix.

Wait, but the note says X is correct. So either the note is wrong or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should check the matrix Y next.

Y = [ [1/2, i/3],
        [-i/3, 1/2] ]

Check if Y is Hermitian. Compute conjugate transpose:

[ [1/2, i/3],
  [-i/3, 1/2] ]

Which is same as Y. So Y is Hermitian.

Trace is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Now check eigenvalues. Again, for a 2x2 matrix, eigenvalues satisfy:

det(Y - λI) = 0

So,

|1/2 - λ, i/3       |
|-i/3, 1/2 - λ| = 0

Compute determinant:

(1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/3)(-i/3) = 0

Expand (1/2 - λ)^2 = 1/4 - λ + λ^2

Compute (i/3)(-i/3) = (-i^2)/9 = (1)/9

Thus, determinant equation:

λ^2 - λ + 1/4 - 1/9 = 0

Compute constants: 1/4 - 1/9 = (9 - 4)/36 = 5/36

Thus, equation is λ^2 - λ + 5/36 = 0

Solving:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 20/36)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(16/36)] / 2 = [1 ± 4/6]/2 = [1 ± 2/3]/2

So,

First eigenvalue: (1 + 2/3)/2 = (5/3)/2 = 5/6 ≈ 0.833

Second eigenvalue: (1 - 2/3)/2 = (1/3)/2 = 1/6 ≈ 0.166

Both eigenvalues positive. So Y is positive semi-definite. So Y is a valid density matrix.

Moving on to Z:

Z = [ [2/3, 1/4],
        [1/4, 1/3] ]

Check if Z is Hermitian. Since all entries are real, Z is Hermitian.

Trace is 2/3 + 1/3 = 1.

Eigenvalues: Compute determinant:

|2/3 - λ, 1/4        |
|1/4, 1/3 - λ| = 0

Compute determinant:

(2/3 - λ)(1/3 - λ) - (1/4)(1/4) = 0

Expand:

(2/3)(1/3) - (2/3)λ - (1/3)λ + λ^2 - 1/16 = 0

Compute 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9

Combine λ terms: -2/3 λ - 1/3 λ = -λ

Thus, equation:

λ^2 - λ + 2/9 - 1/16 = 0

Compute constants: 2/9 ≈ 0.222, 1/16 ≈ 0.0625; so 2/9 - 1/16 = (32 - 9)/144 = 23/144 ≈ 0.159

Thus, equation: λ^2 - λ + 23/144 = 0

Solve quadratic:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(23/144))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 92/144)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(52/144)]/2 = [1 ± (2*sqrt13)/12]/2 = [1 ± sqrt13/6]/2

Compute numerical values:

sqrt13 ≈ 3.606, so sqrt13/6 ≈ 0.601

Thus,

First eigenvalue: (1 + 0.601)/2 ≈ 1.601/2 ≈ 0.8005

Second eigenvalue: (1 - 0.601)/2 ≈ 0.399/2 ≈ 0.1995

Both positive, so Z is positive semi-definite.

So, summarizing:

- W: Not Hermitian → Not a density matrix
- X: Hermitian, but has negative eigenvalue → Not positive semi-definite
- Y: Hermitian and positive semi-definite → Valid
- Z: Hermitian and positive semi-definite → Valid

But according to the note, W, X, and Z are quantum states. So the note seems incorrect based on my analysis.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake with W. Let me go back. W is:

[1/2, i/4]
[-i/4, 1/2]

Is this Hermitian? The (1,2) entry is i/4, so conjugate is -i/4, which should be in (2,1). In W, (2,1) is -i/4. So actually, W is equal to its conjugate transpose because:

Conjugate transpose would swap (1,2) and (2,1), changing their signs as necessary. Here, W has (1,2)=i/4 and (2,1)=-i/4. The conjugate transpose would have (1,2)=conjugate(-i/4)=i/4 and (2,1)=conjugate(i/4)=-i/4. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the conjugate transpose is formed by conjugating each entry and then transposing. So original W:

Row 1: 1/2, i/4

Row 2: -i/4, 1/2

Conjugate each entry:

Row 1: 1/2, -i/4

Row 2: i/4, 1/2

Then transpose:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: 1/2, i/4

Column 2 becomes Row 2: -i/4, 1/2

Wait, that's the same as the original W. So W is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, W is Hermitian. Okay, so my initial conclusion was wrong. So W is Hermitian. That was a mistake on my part earlier. I confused the positions.

So W is Hermitian. Its trace is 1. Now, check eigenvalues.

Compute determinant of W:

(1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (i^2)/16 = 1/4 - (-1)/16 = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16

So determinant is 5/16, which is positive. Since the trace is 1 and determinant is positive, the eigenvalues are real. Let's compute them.

For W, eigenvalues satisfy:

det(W - λI) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4) = 0

Compute (1/2 - λ)^2 - (i/4)(-i/4) = (1/2 - λ)^2 - (1/16)

Set equal to zero:

(1/2 - λ)^2 - 1/16 = 0

Expand (1/2 - λ)^2 = 1/4 - λ + λ^2

So equation: λ^2 - λ + 1/4 - 1/16 = λ^2 - λ + 3/16 = 0

Solving:

λ
[overthinking]
Alright, I've got these four matrices here: W, X, Y, and Z. The question is asking why W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, a state can be represented by a density matrix, which is a Hermitian matrix with certain properties. Let me try to recall those properties.

First, a density matrix must be Hermitian. That means if the matrix has a complex number in one position, the complex conjugate should be in the corresponding position after transposing. So, I should check if W, X, Z are Hermitian.

Looking at W first:
W = [1/2, i/4;
     -i/4, 1/2]

To check if it's Hermitian, I need to see if W equals its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose of W would be:
[1/2, -i/4;
  i/4, 1/2]

Comparing this to the original W:
Original W has -i/4 in the bottom left, while its transpose has +i/4. Wait, is that right? Let me compute the transpose and conjugate.

Transposing W gives:
[1/2, -i/4;
  i/4, 1/2]

But taking the conjugate of each element in the transpose:
The (1,2) element is -i/4, whose conjugate is +i/4.
The (2,1) element is i/4, whose conjugate is -i/4.

So, the conjugate transpose of W is:
[1/2, i/4;
 -i/4, 1/2]

Which is exactly W itself! So W is Hermitian. Good.

Next, X:
X = [1/3, 1;
      1, 2/3]

Is X Hermitian? Let me compute its conjugate transpose. Since all the entries are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So transpose of X is:
[1/3, 1;
  1, 2/3]

Which is the same as X. So X is Hermitian too.

Now, Y:
Y = [1/2, i/3;
     -i/3, 1/2]

Compute the conjugate transpose. Transpose first:
[1/2, -i/3;
  i/3, 1/2]

Then take the conjugate:
[1/2, -i/3 becomes 1/2, i/3;
  i/3 becomes -i/3]

So the conjugate transpose is:
[1/2, -i/3;
  i/3, 1/2]

Compare to Y:
Y is [1/2, i/3;
      -i/3, 1/2]

They are not the same. The (1,2) element in Y is +i/3, but in the conjugate transpose, it's -i/3. So Y is not Hermitian. Therefore, Y cannot be a density matrix.

Finally, Z:
Z = [2/3, 1/4;
     1/4, 1/3]

Checking if it's Hermitian. Since all elements are real, the transpose is the same as the matrix itself. So Z is Hermitian.

Okay, so W, X, Z are Hermitian. But that's just the first condition. A density matrix must also have a trace equal to 1, and must be positive semi-definite, meaning all its eigenvalues are non-negative.

Let me check the trace for each.

For W:
Trace = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Good.

For X:
Trace = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

For Z:
Trace = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1. Good.

Y's trace is also 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but since it's not Hermitian, it doesn't qualify.

Now, the next condition is positive semi-definiteness. One way to check this is to ensure that the matrix is a Gram matrix, meaning that it can be written as a sum of outer products of its columns (or rows). Alternatively, calculating its eigenvalues is another method, but that might be more involved.

Alternatively, since all these matrices are 2x2, I can check if their eigenvalues are non-negative.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [a, b; c, d] are given by (a + d ± sqrt((a - d)^2 + 4bc))/2.

So let's compute eigenvalues for W, X, Z.

Starting with W:
W = [1/2, i/4;
     -i/4, 1/2]

Compute the trace: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Compute the determinant: (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = 1/4 - (-i^2)/16 = 1/4 - (-(-1))/16 = 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16.

Wait, hold on:

The determinant is ad - bc.

So, (1/2)(1/2) - (i/4)(-i/4) = (1/4) - (-i^2)/16.

Since i^2 = -1, so it's (1/4) - (-(-1))/16 = 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16.

So determinant is 3/16.

Then, eigenvalues satisfy λ^2 - trace*λ + determinant = 0.

So λ^2 - λ + 3/16 = 0.

Solution: [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(3/16))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 3/4)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1/4)]/2 = [1 ± 1/2]/2.

Thus, eigenvalues are (1 + 1/2)/2 = 3/4 and (1 - 1/2)/2 = 1/4.

Both eigenvalues are positive, so W is positive semi-definite.

Next, X:
X = [1/3, 1;
      1, 2/3]

Compute trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.

Compute determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9.

Wait, determinant is negative. That's a problem because for positive semi-definiteness, determinant should be non-negative for 2x2 matrices? Wait, no, in 2x2, determinant can be positive or negative depending on the matrix.

But actually, for a density matrix, the determinant must be non-negative because the product of eigenvalues is the determinant, which must be non-negative.

Wait, determinant is negative here for X: -7/9. So determinant is negative, which would mean the matrix is indefinite (one eigenvalue positive, one negative). So X is not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix.

Wait, that contradicts the initial statement. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, hold on. If determinant is negative, the matrix is not positive semi-definite because it has complex eigenvalues? Wait, no. For real matrices, negative determinant just means eigenvalues have opposite signs.

But density matrices must have non-negative determinant because they are positive semi-definite. So negative determinant would mean it's not a density matrix. Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state, which contradicts the given answer. Hmm, so that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing determinant. Let me check again.

X = [1/3, 1;
      1, 2/3]

Determinant is (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = (2/9) - 1 = (2 - 9)/9 = (-7)/9. Yes, that's correct. So determinant is negative. Therefore, X is not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix. But the original statement says W, X, Z are quantum states.

Wait, this suggests that maybe the determinant for X is positive? Or perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, but 1/3 * 2/3 is 2/9, and 1*1 is 1, so 2/9 - 1 is indeed negative.

Is there another condition that allows for negative determinant? Wait, no, for a density matrix, the determinant must be non-negative because it's the product of the eigenvalues, which are non-negative. So if determinant is negative, it's not a density matrix. So either I'm making a mistake here, or the initial answer is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, actually, the determinant of X is negative, so X cannot be a density matrix. So perhaps only W and Z are density matrices.

But the given answer is that W, X, and Z are quantum states. That suggests that X is a density matrix, but according to my calculations, it's not.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues for X? Let me compute the eigenvalues of X.

Given X = [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3], which is real and symmetric. So eigenvalues should be real.

The characteristic equation is (1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = 0.

Compute:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2 = 2/9 - λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2.

Wait, better to compute it as:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) = (1/3)(2/3) - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ^2 = 2/9 - λ + λ^2.

Subtracting 1*1 = 1:

2/9 - λ + λ^2 - 1 = λ^2 - λ - 7/9 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 9:

9λ^2 - 9λ - 7 = 0.

Quadratic equation: λ = [9 ± sqrt(81 + 252)] / 18.

Wait, sqrt(81 + 252) = sqrt(333) ≈ 18.248.

So λ ≈ [9 ± 18.248]/18.

Positive root: (27.248)/18 ≈ 1.513.

Negative root: (-9.248)/18 ≈ -0.514.

So eigenvalues are approximately 1.513 and -0.514. One positive, one negative. Therefore, X has negative eigenvalues, so it's not positive semi-definite, hence not a density matrix. So X cannot be a quantum state.

Hmm, so that contradicts the initial answer. So perhaps the correct answer is only W and Z.

Wait, but let me check Z.

Z = [2/3, 1/4;
     1/4, 1/3]

Compute trace: 2/3 + 1/3 = 1.

Compute determinant: (2/3)(1/3) - (1/4)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/16 = (32 - 9)/144 = 23/144.

Positive determinant, which is good. So determinant is positive.

Now, eigenvalues: For Z, using the formula:

λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(2/3)(1/4))]/2. Wait, no, actually for a general 2x2, the eigenvalues are (trace ± sqrt(trace^2 - 4 determinant))/2.

So for Z, trace is 1, determinant is 23/144.

So λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*(23/144))]/2.

Compute inside sqrt: 1 - 92/144 = (144 - 92)/144 = 52/144 = 13/36.

So sqrt(13/36) = sqrt(13)/6 ≈ 3.6055/6 ≈ 0.6009.

Thus, eigenvalues are [1 ± 0.6009]/2.

So λ1 ≈ (1 + 0.6009)/2 ≈ 0.80045, and λ2 ≈ (1 - 0.6009)/2 ≈ 0.19955.

Both eigenvalues are positive, so Z is positive semi-definite. Hence, Z is a density matrix.

So, going back, W, Z are density matrices. X is not because it has negative eigenvalues. Y is not Hermitian.

But the original answer says W, X, Z are quantum states. So perhaps I made a mistake with X.

Wait, perhaps X can still be a density matrix if it's not positive definite but something else? Wait, no. A density matrix must be positive semi-definite, meaning all eigenvalues must be non-negative. If X has one negative eigenvalue, it's not. So maybe the given answer is incorrect, or perhaps X is a valid density matrix because determinant is considered differently?

Wait, but the determinant is negative, so it's not. Maybe the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a quantum state, but the question says W, X, Z. So maybe the correct answer is W and Z, but perhaps the original statement is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with X's determinant.

Wait, X = [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3]

Determinant: (1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9, which is negative. So definitely, X is not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a density matrix because it's a projection matrix? Wait, projection matrices have trace 1, but they also have determinant 0. In this case, determinant is -7/9, so no. So it's neither.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial given answer is wrong. Maybe only W and Z are valid.

But according to the user's note, the correct answer is W, X, and Z are quantum states. So I must have messed up something.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether X is positive semi-definite. Let me check its eigenvalues again.

Earlier, I got approximately 1.51 and -0.51. So one positive, one negative. So X is indefinite, not positive semi-definite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the positive definiteness via the leading principal minors.

For a 2x2 matrix, the leading principal minors are:

First minor: the (1,1) entry = 1/3 > 0.

Second minor: determinant = -7/9 < 0.

Since determinant is negative, it's not positive definite. Hence, X is not a density matrix.

So, perhaps the original statement is incorrect. Only W and Z are quantum states.

But wait, the user says the correct answer is W, X, Z. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider X as a valid density matrix because the negative eigenvalue is somehow allowed? But no, in quantum mechanics, density matrices must have non-negative eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the determinant. Let me compute determinant of X again.

X = [1/3, 1;
      1, 2/3]

(1/3)(2/3) - (1)(1) = 2/9 - 1 = -7/9. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, unless the trace is different? No, trace is 1/3 + 2/3 = 1.

So, seems like X is not a density matrix. So perhaps the correct answer is only W and Z.

But the user says W, X, Z. So maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps X is a valid density matrix because it's not required to be positive semi-definite? But no, density matrices must be positive semi-definite.

Wait, maybe I should consider that X is not a density matrix, but perhaps due to some other property.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial matrices were presented incorrectly, and X is actually another matrix.

But according to the user, the matrices are as given.

So perhaps the correct answer is W and Z, but the user says W, X, Z. So maybe the user is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing X's eigenvalues.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues more accurately.

For X = [1/3, 1; 1, 2/3]

The characteristic equation is:

| X - λ I | = 0

So,

|1/3 - λ, 1;
1, 2/3 - λ| = 0

Compute determinant:

(1/3 - λ)(2/3 - λ) - (1)(1) = 0

Expand:

(1/3)(2/3) - (1/3)λ - (2/3)λ + λ^2 -1 = 0

Compute:

2/9 - (1/3 + 2/3)λ + λ^2 -1 = 0

Simplify:

2/9 - λ + λ^2 -1 = λ^2 - λ -7/9 =0

Multiply by 9:

9λ^2 -9λ -7=0

Solutions:

λ = [9 ± sqrt(81 + 252)] / 18

sqrt(333) ≈ 18.248

So,

λ ≈ (9 + 18.248)/18 ≈ 27.248/18 ≈ 1.513

λ ≈ (9 - 18.248)/18 ≈ (-9.248)/18 ≈ -0.514

So, same result. Therefore, X has negative eigenvalues, so it's not positive semi-definite.

Therefore, X cannot be a quantum state, which contradicts the user's assertion.

So, perhaps the initial answer is incorrect, and only W and Z are quantum states.

But since the user says the correct answer is W, X, Z, maybe I should consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps the user mistyped the matrices? Let me double-check X
