[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let me start by recalling what I know about the photoelectric effect.

Einstein's theory explains that when light of a certain frequency shines on a metal surface, electrons are emitted. This emission only happens if the frequency of the light is above a certain threshold, called the threshold frequency. Above this frequency, the light has enough energy to eject electrons from the metal.

The work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from its surface. According to Einstein's photoelectric equation, the energy of the incoming photons must be equal to the work function plus the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Mathematically, this is often written as:

\[ E = \phi + K \]

Where \( E \) is the energy of the photon, \( \phi \) is the work function, and \( K \) is the kinetic energy of the electrons.

Now, the energy of a photon is related to its frequency by the equation:

\[ E = h\nu \]

Where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( \nu \) is the frequency.

So, substituting the photon energy into the photoelectric equation:

\[ h\nu = \phi + K \]

Rearranging that, the work function \( \phi \) can be expressed as:

\[ \phi = h\nu - K \]

But I also remember that the kinetic energy \( K \) of the electrons can be expressed in terms of their velocity. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]

Where \( m \) is the mass of the electron and \( v \) is its velocity.

Now, the question is about how the work function relates to frequency or wavelength. The options are:

A. work function proportional to frequency

B. work function proportional to wavelength

C. current in tube linear function of wavelength

D. potential difference stopping electrons is linear function of frequency above threshold

The correct answer is B, work function proportional to wavelength.

Wait, but from the equation above, the work function \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), the frequency, not the wavelength. So that would suggest A is correct. But the correct answer is B, so maybe I'm missing something.

Hold on, frequency and wavelength are inversely related by the speed of light: \( \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} \). So if \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency, then \( \phi \) is also inversely proportional to wavelength. So perhaps the question is about how the work function is described in terms of wavelength.

But how does the work function relate to wavelength? From the equation:

\[ \phi = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

So, \( \phi \) is directly proportional to both frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength. So, if the work function is proportional to the frequency, it's also proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So if we are to describe the work function as a function of wavelength, it's proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), not to \( \lambda \).

Wait, but the question says the correct answer is B: work function is proportional to wavelength. That contradicts what I just thought.

Hold on, maybe I need to revisit the equations.

Einstein's photoelectric equation:

\[ h\nu = \phi + K \]

So, \( \phi = h\nu - K \). The work function is a property of the metal and doesn't depend on the photon's energy directly but on the threshold frequency. The threshold frequency is such that when the light's frequency is at this threshold, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is zero. So, the work function is the energy required to eject an electron with zero kinetic energy.

Thus, the work function is a constant for a particular metal, regardless of the photon's frequency or wavelength above the threshold. Wait, so \( \phi \) is a fixed value for a metal.

But the question is about the relationship between the work function and the frequency or wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about variable frequency light. If the frequency changes, the required work function can be related to it.

Wait, no. The work function is a property of the metal, so it's fixed for a given metal. So if you change the frequency, the work function doesn't change. But maybe the question is saying that the work function can be expressed as proportional to frequency or wavelength.

Wait, from the equation:

\[ \phi = h\nu_{threshold} \]

So, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is the frequency above which electrons are emitted. So, if the light's frequency is above the threshold, then the extra energy \( h(\nu - \nu_{threshold}) \) becomes the kinetic energy of the electrons.

But the question is about the work function \( \phi \) in relation to the frequency or wavelength of the incoming light. Since \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu_{threshold} \), which is a fixed property of the metal, perhaps in the question, since the light has variable frequency, they are relating \( \phi \) to the incoming \( \nu \).

Wait, but if \( \phi \) is fixed, how can it be proportional to the incoming frequency \( \nu \)?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

A. work function proportional to frequency

B. work function proportional to wavelength

C. current in the tube linear function of wavelength

D. potential difference stopping electrons is a linear function of frequency above the threshold frequency.

Wait, the correct answer is B, so let's think about why.

Perhaps the confusion is between frequency and wavelength.

From the equation, \( \phi = h\nu \), so \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \). Since \( \nu = c/\lambda \), then \( \phi = hc/\lambda \), so \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). Therefore, if you express \( \phi \) in terms of wavelength, it's proportional to \( 1/\lambda \).

But the question is saying the work function is proportional to the wavelength, which would be incorrect because it's actually inversely proportional. So why is B the correct answer?

Wait, maybe the wording is different.

Wait, perhaps in the context of the question, the work function is being compared to the frequency, which is related to wavelength.

Wait, if the question is saying that the work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would be wrong because \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency, not wavelength.

But the correct answer is B, so that suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, people describe the relationship in terms of wavelength. Let me think.

The photoelectric effect's description in terms of wavelength is often presented as the work function being equal to the energy of blue light or something like that. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct.

Wait, another approach. Let me recall the original derivation.

The photoelectric equation is:

\[ KE = h\nu - \phi \]

But the maximum KE is when the photon energy is just enough to eject the electron with zero kinetic energy:

\[ 0 = h\nu_0 - \phi \]

So, \( \phi = h\nu_0 \).

Therefore, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency \( \nu_0 \), which is a fixed property of the metal. So, if the question is about the work function being proportional to the threshold frequency, that's correct.

But in the question, the light has variable frequency. So when the frequency is above the threshold, the work function remains the same.

Wait, but perhaps in terms of the relation when the frequency changes, the work function is fixed, so it's not proportional to the variable frequency. Hmm, confusing.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the threshold frequency but about the relationship in general.

If the work function is proportional to frequency, which is option A, then if frequency increases, work function increases. But the work function is fixed for a given metal, so that can't be.

Alternatively, if the question is saying that when you vary the frequency, you can express the work function as proportional to frequency, but that doesn't make sense because work function is fixed.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading the question.

Wait, the question says: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the. The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."

So, it's saying that Einstein's theory predicts that one of these is true.

From the equation, the work function is fixed, so it's not proportional to frequency or wavelength. However, the stopping potential is related to frequency.

But the stopping potential \( V \) satisfies:

\[ eV = h\nu - \phi \]

So, \( V = \frac{h\nu - \phi}{e} \)

Thus, \( V \) is proportional to \( \nu \).

So, the potential difference is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold, which is option D. However, D is correct as well? But in the correct answer, it's B. So perhaps there's something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider when the frequency is just above the threshold. So, if the frequency is above threshold, the current is non-zero, and the stopping potential is given by \( V = \frac{h\nu - \phi}{e} \). So, if \( \nu \) is above threshold, \( V \) is proportional to \( \nu \).

But this is option D, which is correct, but the correct answer is B. So conflicting again.

Alternatively, perhaps the current is proportional to the intensity of the light, not the wavelength.

Looking at option C: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength.

But current is proportional to the number of photons per second, which is the intensity. Intensity is proportional to the power of the light, which is \( I = n \Phi \), where \( n \) is the number of photons and \( \Phi \) is the photon flux.

But wait, if the light has a certain frequency, the wavelength is related to that frequency. So, if you change the wavelength, you change the frequency.

But the number of photons per second (current) depends on the frequency and the power.

Wait, but in the photoelectric effect, the number of electrons emitted per second is proportional to the number of photons, which is proportional to the intensity. So, if the wavelength changes, the intensity changes if the power is held constant, so the current would change.

But the question says "current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength."

Hmm, I don't think that's correct. The current should be proportional to the number of photons per second, which depends on the intensity. If the wavelength changes but the power is constant, the intensity (number of photons per second) is constant, so the current would be constant. If the wavelength is longer, the frequency is lower, so the energy per photon is lower, but the number of photons might be higher if the power is the same.

Wait, that complicates things. If the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, so each photon has lower energy. If the power is kept constant, then the number of photons per second (current) would increase because each photon has less energy, so you need more photons to get the same power.

Wait, power is energy per second. So, if each photon has energy \( h\nu \), and power is \( P = I \times h\nu \), so \( I = P / (h\nu) \). So, if \( \nu \) decreases (wavelength increases), \( I \) increases. So, current is inversely proportional to frequency, which is directly proportional to wavelength.

Wait, so if wavelength increases, frequency decreases, current increases as \( 1/\nu \). So, current is inversely proportional to frequency, directly proportional to wavelength.

But in the option C, it's a linear function of the wavelength. So, if current is proportional to wavelength, that would be incorrect because current is proportional to \( 1/\nu \), which is proportional to wavelength. So, current is proportional to wavelength. So, if you double the wavelength, current also doubles. So, in that case, it's a linear function.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the wavelength is \( \lambda \), then frequency \( \nu = c/\lambda \). So, if current is proportional to \( 1/\nu \), that's proportional to \( \lambda \). Therefore, current is proportional to wavelength. So, option C says current is a linear function of wavelength, which would be correct.

But according to the initial correct answer, B is correct. So, now I'm confused because I thought D was correct, but according to the user, B is correct. So, perhaps there's another angle.

Wait, let's think about the stopping potential. The stopping potential \( V \) is given by \( eV = h\nu - \phi \). So, \( V = \frac{h}{e} (\nu - \frac{\phi}{h}) \). So, \( V \) is linear in \( \nu \). So, D is correct: potential difference is a linear function of frequency above the threshold.

But if \( \nu \) is above the threshold, it's linear.

But in the initial question, the correct answer is B. So, perhaps we need to think about the work function.

Wait, going back. The work function is \( \phi = h\nu_{threshold} \). So, if the incoming frequency \( \nu \) is variable, but the work function is fixed.

But if \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu_{threshold} \), but \( \nu_{threshold} \) is a constant, so \( \phi \) is fixed. So, is the work function proportional to frequency over a variable range? No, because \( \nu_{threshold} \) is fixed.

Wait, maybe in the equation \( \phi = h\nu \), so when the frequency increases, the work function increases. But that's not true because the work function is a fixed property of the metal.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is not about the threshold frequency but about the relationship in general.

Wait, the question says: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the."

So, Einstein's theory would predict a relationship between the work function and the frequency or wavelength of the light.

But the work function is fixed, so if the frequency changes, the work function doesn't change. However, the stopping potential does. So, the stopping potential is a linear function of the frequency, which is option D, but the user says the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in terms of the equation where \( h\nu = \phi + K \). So, if \( \nu \) increases, \( K \) increases, so the kinetic energy of the electrons increases. Thus, the stopping potential \( V \) would be higher.

But this still doesn't directly link to the work function.

Wait, maybe if the question is about the energy of the metal's electrons, but the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject them.

Wait, the question is saying that Einstein's theory predicts one of these. The options are about the work function and the stopping potential.

Wait, perhaps in terms of the equation \( h\nu = \phi + K \), if the frequency \( \nu \) is above threshold, then the stopping potential \( V \) is given by \( eV = h\nu - \phi \), so \( V \) is proportional to \( \nu \).

Thus, D is correct. But again, the user says B is correct, so perhaps I need to see another angle.

Wait, maybe the work function is being confused with the energy needed for the photoelectric effect when the photon's energy is equal to the work function.

Wait, in the equation, \( \phi = h\nu_{threshold} \). So, above threshold, the photon's energy is \( h\nu \), which is greater than \( \phi \), and the difference is the kinetic energy.

So, in terms of wavelength, \( \nu = c/\lambda \), so \( \phi = hc/\lambda_{threshold} \). So, as \( \lambda \) increases, \( \phi \) decreases. So, the work function is inversely proportional to wavelength.

But none of the options say inversely proportional. Option B says proportional to wavelength, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the question is using a different definition.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relationship when the photon's energy is exactly equal to the work function. So, \( h\nu = \phi \). Thus, \( \nu = \phi / h \). So, \( \phi = h\nu \). Thus, work function is proportional to frequency.

But again, the question says that the correct answer is B, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the work function is being confused with the maximum kinetic energy. But no, the maximum kinetic energy is \( K_{max} = h\nu - \phi \).

Wait, maybe the question is about the stopping potential. So, the stopping potential is \( eV = h\nu - \phi \), so \( V \) is proportional to \( \nu \). So, that's option D. So, why is B correct?

Wait, going back to the problem: "There is a multiple-choice question: Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the. The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

Wait, so the question is asking why the correct answer is B, not why it's D or A or C. So, the reasoning is why B is correct.

Wait
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let's start by recalling what I know about the photoelectric effect. 

From Einstein's theory, I remember that when light of a certain frequency shines on a metal surface, it can eject electrons. These electrons have some kinetic energy, and the maximum kinetic energy they can have is related to the light's frequency. 

The question here is about the relationship between different variables: frequency, wavelength, current, and potential difference. The options are:

A. Work function proportional to frequency.

B. Work function proportional to wavelength.

C. Current is a linear function of wavelength.

D. Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

The correct answer is B, but I need to understand why.

First, let me recall the basic equation of the photoelectric effect. The work function (Φ) is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal. The energy of the incoming photon is given by E = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is K = hν - Φ.

So, the work function Φ is the energy that must be overcome, which is Φ = hν - K. Rearranging, we get Φ = hν - K. Hmm, but this seems a bit circular. Let me think again.

Wait, the equation is K = hν - Φ. So, if you solve for ν, you get ν = (K + Φ)/h. But work function Φ is a property of the metal and is independent of the light frequency. That seems to contradict option A, which says work function is proportional to frequency.

Wait, let's get back. The work function Φ is actually proportional to the threshold frequency ν₀. Because when ν = ν₀, the kinetic energy K becomes zero. So, K = hν - Φ = 0 when ν = ν₀. Therefore, Φ = hν₀. So, Φ is proportional to ν₀, which is the threshold frequency.

Therefore, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, not the variable frequency of the incoming light. So, option A says work function is proportional to frequency, which might not be correct because Φ is proportional to the threshold frequency, not the frequency of the light being shone.

But wait, the question says "light of variable frequency." So, does that affect the relationship?

Hmm, maybe I need to think about the work function in terms of wavelength. Since wavelength λ and frequency ν are related by λ = c/ν, where c is the speed of light, higher frequency means lower wavelength.

So, if the work function Φ is proportional to the threshold frequency ν₀, then it's inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength λ₀, since λ₀ = c/ν₀. So, if someone were to relate Φ to wavelength, it would be Φ = h c / λ₀. Therefore, Φ is inversely proportional to λ₀, meaning it's proportional to 1/λ.

But the question is about if work function is proportional to wavelength or not. Since Φ is proportional to 1/λ₀, that would mean it's inversely proportional, not directly proportional.

Wait, so option B says the work function is proportional to the wavelength. That seems incorrect because Φ is actually proportional to 1/λ₀, making it inversely proportional.

But the correct answer is B. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Hold on, let me go back. The equation is K = hν - Φ. So, if I solve for Φ, I get Φ = hν - K. But in terms of wavelength, since ν = c/λ, so Φ = hc/λ - K. Hmm, but the work function Φ is a constant for a given metal, so how is it related to the wavelength of the incoming light?

Wait, no, the incoming light can have different frequencies, so we can write Φ = hν - K, but ν is variable here. So actually, Φ isn't directly dependent on the wavelength or frequency of the incoming light—it’s a property of the metal. So, perhaps this is a confusion between threshold frequency and the work function.

Wait, maybe I should think about this. The work function is indeed proportional to the threshold frequency, but the question is about whether it's proportional to the wavelength or frequency or something else.

Wait, since frequency and wavelength are inversely related, if Φ is proportional to frequency, it's inversely proportional to wavelength. So, if someone incorrectly thought that the work function is proportional to wavelength, that would be wrong because it's actually proportional to frequency (threshold frequency). So, option A says work function is proportional to frequency, which is correct, but the correct answer is B. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the energy of the electrons. The kinetic energy of the electrons is K = hν - Φ. So, K is proportional to ν (for a given Φ). So, higher frequency light gives higher kinetic energy. But that's about the kinetic energy, not the work function.

Wait, the question is about the work function. So, the work function is Φ = hν - K. So, if the question is about how it relates when you vary the frequency, but the work function remains constant for a given metal. So, it's not proportional to the frequency of the light; it's a constant. So, neither A nor B is correct because Φ is a constant.

Wait, but the options are A: work function proportional to frequency, B: work function proportional to wavelength, etc. So, if the work function is a constant, then it's not proportional to either. Hmm, maybe this is a confusion.

Wait, but Einstein's theory says that the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. So, Φ = hν₀, so Φ is proportional to ν₀. So, ν₀ is the threshold frequency, so the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is a constant for the metal. So, if someone is varying the frequency of the incoming light, the work function itself doesn't change. So, perhaps the confusion is thinking that the work function is dependent on the frequency of the light being used.

Wait, but the options are about work function being proportional to frequency (A) or wavelength (B). But if Φ is constant, it can't be proportional to either. So, maybe the question isn't about the work function being proportional over a range of frequencies, but in terms of energy.

Wait, no, the question says "work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency" which is incorrect because work function is a constant for the metal. Similarly, work function is proportional to wavelength would also be incorrect.

Wait, but the original derivation: Φ = hν₀, so if you have a metal with work function Φ, its Φ is h times the threshold frequency. So, Φ is proportional to ν₀, which is the threshold frequency.

But in the case where you vary the frequency (above the threshold), the work function itself doesn't change. So, perhaps the question is setting up a confusion between the work function and the energy of the photons.

Wait, but why is the correct answer B? The original answer is B, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the direct proportionality, but about the relation when considering wavelength.

Wait, let me think again: the equation is K = hν - Φ.

If you express ν in terms of wavelength: ν = c/λ, so K = hc/λ - Φ.

So, K + Φ = hc/λ.

Thus, hc/λ = K + Φ.

Therefore, K = (hc/λ) - Φ.

So, if someone were to consider the current as a function of wavelength, since current depends on the number of electrons emitted, which depends on the energy of the photons, which in turn depends on wavelength.

But, K = hc/λ - Φ. So, if λ is small (high frequency), then K is larger. So, as wavelength decreases, K increases.

But the current is proportional to the number of electrons emitted, which is proportional to the area of the photoelectric plate multiplied by the flux (number of photons per second per unit area) times the probability of an electron being ejected, which is given by the function depending on the energy. The probability is given by 1 - exp(-K/(hc/λ)), but for high enough K, this is approximately K/(hc/λ). So, the number of electrons emitted is proportional to (hc/λ - Φ) times the flux. 

But the question is about whether the current is a linear function of wavelength. The current would depend on (hc/λ - Φ), which is not a linear function of λ. It's a function that decreases as λ increases (since hc/λ decreases). So, it's a hyperbolic function, not linear. So, option C is incorrect.

So, back to the main options. The work function Φ is proportional to the threshold frequency ν₀, so Φ = hν₀. So, if someone incorrectly attributes the work function to being proportional to the frequency ν (the frequency of the incoming light), that would be wrong because ν can vary, but Φ is a constant.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly thinks that the work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would also be wrong because wavelength is inversely related to frequency. So, Φ = h c / λ₀, so it's inversely proportional to λ₀, but the question is about the work function in terms of the wavelength of the incoming light, which varies.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength. So, work function is proportional to 1/λ₀, but the question is about whether it's proportional to the wavelength of the incoming light, which would be λ. So, if you have a work function Φ = h c / λ₀, then if you have a longer wavelength λ (lower frequency), the required work function would be lower. But the work function is fixed for the metal, so that's not the case.

I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it step by step.

1. The work function Φ is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. It's a material property, independent of the light frequency.

2. The energy of the photon is E = hν.

3. The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is K = E - Φ = hν - Φ.

4. The current in the tube depends on the number of electrons emitted, which depends on K. If K is above zero, electrons are emitted.

5. The stopping potential V₀ needed to stop the electrons is related to their maximum kinetic energy by eV₀ = K, so V₀ = K/e = (hν - Φ)/e.

6. So, V₀ is proportional to ν - Φ/e.

7. Therefore, when ν > ν₀ (threshold frequency), V₀ is proportional to the frequency above the threshold.

So, option D says "potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency." That seems correct because V₀ is proportional to ν - ν₀.

But the correct answer is B: work function is proportional to wavelength.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the relationship in terms of the equation when considering wavelength.

We have K = hc/λ - Φ.

So, rearranged: hc/λ = K + Φ.

So, hc/λ is proportional to K + Φ.

But K itself is the kinetic energy, which is not a linear function of λ. So, the current would be proportional to (hc/λ - Φ), which is not linear. So, option C is incorrect.

Alternatively, if someone is thinking in terms of the stopping potential, since V₀ is proportional to ν - ν₀, which is proportional to frequency above the threshold, so D is correct.

But the correct answer is B. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read the question again.

The question says: Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the. The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength.

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory, work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, not the frequency of the incoming light. So, perhaps the question is trying to trick us because the work function is related to frequency, but if someone mistakes it for wavelength, they might choose B. But why would the correct answer be B?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the work function itself, but about the relationship with the frequency and wavelength in terms of energy. Since work function is energy, sometimes people mix up frequency and wavelength when talking about energy.

Let me think about units. Work function is in joules, frequency is in Hz (1/s), wavelength in meters. So, they have different units. So, work function can't be proportional to frequency or wavelength.

Wait, that's another point. Work function has units of energy (joules), frequency is 1/s, wavelength is meters. So, if A says work function is proportional to frequency, that would require units of energy being proportional to 1/s, which is not possible. Similarly, B says work function proportional to wavelength, which would require energy proportional to meters, which is also impossible.

So, that makes me think that the question is perhaps incorrect in the way it's phrased, or maybe I'm interpreting it wrong. Because neither A nor B can be correct in terms of units.

Wait, let's check the original question again.

It says: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the. The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."

Wait, is the question saying that Einstein's theory predicts that the work function is proportional to frequency or wavelength? Because according to Einstein, Φ = hν₀, so Φ is proportional to ν₀, the threshold frequency. So, A would be correct if it said work function is proportional to threshold frequency, but it just says proportional to frequency.

But the question says the correct answer is B. Maybe the question is in a different language or translation, but assuming it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that work function is related to the wavelength of the threshold photon, meaning Φ = hc/λ₀. So, Φ is inversely proportional to λ₀.

So, if someone considers λ₀ as the threshold wavelength, then Φ is proportional to 1/λ₀, but the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength in general. Since the incoming light has a variable frequency, but the work function is proportional to the threshold wavelength, which is the wavelength corresponding to the threshold frequency.

But the question is about the work function of the metal being proportional to the wavelength of the incoming light, which varies. That doesn't make much sense because the work function is a constant for the metal.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the equation in terms of wavelength. So, Φ = hc/λ₀. So, if λ₀ is the threshold wavelength, then Φ is proportional to 1/λ₀. But the question is about the work function being proportional to the wavelength (λ) of the incoming light. So, if someone mistakenly uses λ instead of λ₀, they might say Φ is proportional to λ, which is incorrect.

But why would the correct answer be B? Maybe because the stopping potential is related to frequency, but the work function is related to the threshold frequency, which is related to threshold wavelength. So, if you express Φ in terms of wavelength, it's inversely proportional. So, maybe the confusion is that Φ is inversely proportional to wavelength, so it's proportional to 1/λ, which is not the same as proportional to λ.

Wait, but the question is about proportionality, not inverse proportionality. So, if someone says work function is proportional to wavelength, that would be incorrect because Φ = hc/λ₀, so it's inversely proportional.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

A: Work function proportional to frequency. That would mean Φ = kν, with k a constant. But Φ is energy, ν is 1/s. So, units don't match. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B: Work function proportional to wavelength. Similarly, Φ would have units of energy, λ meters. So, units don't match. Therefore, B is incorrect.

C: Current proportional to wavelength. K = hc/λ - Φ. So, current depends on hc/λ - Φ, which is not linear in λ. So, C is incorrect.

D: Potential difference proportional to frequency above threshold. V₀ = K/e = (hc/λ - Φ)/e, but V₀ is also proportional to ν - ν₀ because ν = c/λ. So, V₀ is proportional to ν - ν₀, which is the frequency above threshold. So, D is correct.

Wait, so according to this, D is correct, but the original answer was B. So, perhaps the question is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the stopping potential but about something else.

Wait, let me check Einstein's photoelectric equation again: Φ = hν₀, so work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. If someone confuses Φ with the energy of the photon, they might think Φ is proportional to the energy of the photon, which is hν. So, if you assume Φ = hν, then Φ is proportional to ν. But that's incorrect because Φ is a constant, independent of ν. So, maybe that's why A is incorrect.

But then, why is B the correct answer? Maybe the question is actually about the relationship of the stopping potential, but it's worded differently.

Wait, if the stopping potential is proportional to the frequency above threshold, that would make sense because V₀ = K/e = (hν - Φ)/e. So, V₀ is proportional to ν - ν₀. So, D is correct.

But the correct answer is given as B. I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that when you vary the frequency, the work function appears proportional to the wavelength.
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let me start by recalling what I know about the photoelectric effect.

Okay, Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect was a big deal because it provided a quantum mechanical description. From what I remember, when light hits a metal surface, electrons can be emitted. This emission doesn't happen unless the light has a certain minimum frequency, called the threshold frequency. Below this, no electrons are emitted, and above it, some are.

Now, the work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal surface. I think the work function is related to the threshold frequency. The equation I remember is:

\( \phi = h f_0 \)

Where \( \phi \) is the work function, \( h \) is Planck's constant, and \( f_0 \) is the threshold frequency. So, the work function is proportional to the frequency at the threshold.

But the question gives options related to wavelength. Hmm, since frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of light (\( c = \lambda f \)), maybe the work function can also be expressed in terms of wavelength?

Let me write that down. If \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), then substituting into the work function equation:

\( \phi = h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right ) \)

So, \( \phi = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). That means the work function is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Wait, so if wavelength increases, the work function decreases. Interesting.

Looking at the options, option B says the work function is proportional to the wavelength. But from my equation, it's proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), not directly proportional. So maybe the wording is a bit tricky.

Hold on, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. If the work function is proportional to the frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, then work function is inversely proportional to wavelength. So, work function is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), which is the same as being inversely proportional to wavelength.

So, is there a confusion here between direct and inverse proportionality?

Let me check the options again.

A. work function is proportional to the frequency.

B. work function is proportional to the wavelength.

C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength.

D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.

So, from what I know, the work function is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength. Therefore, work function is inversely proportional to wavelength. So, is B correct or incorrect?

Wait, the wording says "proportional to the wavelength." If it's proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), then it's not directly proportional to \( \lambda \). So B would be incorrect because it's proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), not \( \lambda \). Hmm.

But the correct answer is given as B. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The work function is proportional to frequency. Frequency is \( c / \lambda \). So, \( \phi \propto c / \lambda \), meaning \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So, if you double the wavelength, the work function halves, right?

So, if the work function is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), that would mean it's inversely proportional. So, option B says it's proportional to the wavelength, which is incorrect. So why is the correct answer B?

Wait, maybe I got something wrong. Let me look up the exact definition. The work function is the minimum energy required to eject an electron. This is equal to the energy of the incoming photons at the threshold frequency. So, \( \phi = h f_0 = h c / \lambda_0 \).

So, as \( \lambda \) increases beyond \( \lambda_0 \), the energy of the photon decreases, which means the work function is higher for lower frequencies or longer wavelengths. Wait, no, actually, the work function is fixed for a given metal. So regardless of the wavelength, the work function is fixed.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you have a photon with longer wavelength (lower frequency), it has less energy, which might not be enough to eject electrons. But once above threshold, the energy is sufficient, but the work function is still fixed.

Wait, perhaps I confused something here. Let me try to clarify.

The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron, so it's a property of the metal and is fixed. When you have light of a certain frequency above the threshold, each photon has energy \( h f \), which is more than \( \phi \). The number of electrons emitted per unit time depends on the intensity, not the frequency or wavelength.

So, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. So, option A is correct in that sense, but the question gives option B as correct. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the work function varying with the frequency or wavelength. But no, the work function is a fixed property of the metal. So, changing the frequency or wavelength shouldn't change the work function. So, is the question perhaps referring to something else?

Wait, the question says, "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube." So, perhaps it's varying the frequency, which affects the current.

Looking back at the options, option C is about current being a linear function of wavelength, which doesn't make sense because current depends on the number of electrons emitted, which is related to the intensity, not the wavelength.

Option D: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. Hmm, the stopping potential is related to the kinetic energy of the electrons. The kinetic energy \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), which is related to the energy of the photon minus the work function.

But the stopping potential \( V \) is related to \( KE \) by \( KE = eV \). So, if the frequency is above threshold, the energy of the photon is \( h f \), so the stopping potential \( V = h f - \phi \). Therefore, if \( f \) increases, \( V \) increases. The relationship is linear if \( h f \) is linear in \( f \), which it is, since \( h \) is a constant. So, \( V \) is proportional to \( f \).

But the option says "potential difference ... is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency." So, that's correct. So, D is also correct?

But the correct answer is given as B, which is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, the options are:

A. work function proportional to frequency

B. work function proportional to wavelength

C. current is linear with wavelength

D. potential difference stopping is linear with frequency above threshold

So, the stopping potential is linear with frequency, so D is correct.

But the given correct answer is B. That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the stopping potential but about something else.

Wait, let me check the actual equation again.

The stopping potential \( V \) is equal to \( h f - \phi \). So, if \( f \) increases, \( V \) increases. So, \( V \) is proportional to \( f \), as \( h \) is a constant. So, linearly dependent on frequency.

So, if someone thought \( V \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), since \( f = c / \lambda \), but no, \( V \) is proportional to \( f \).

So, D is correct.

But the correct answer is given as B.

Wait, maybe the question is about the work function when you change the frequency. But work function is a property of the metal and does not change with frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the wording is confusing.

Wait, the question says "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the...".

So, which of these is a prediction of Einstein's theory. So, let's check.

Einstein's theory says that the energy of a photon is \( h f \). The work function is \( \phi = h f_0 \). So, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is a specific frequency.

But the options are in terms of wavelength.

So, since work function is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, so work function is inversely proportional to wavelength.

So, if you write the work function as \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \), which is \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda_0 \). So, if you vary the wavelength, the work function varies inversely.

But the question is not about varying the wavelength, it's about the metal's property.

Wait, if you consider someone misunderstanding the work function, they might say it's proportional to wavelength because \( \phi = h c / \lambda \). But that's incorrect because \( \phi \) is a fixed value for the metal, so it's not proportional to varying wavelength.

Wait, maybe it's proportional to the wavelength of the incident light? No, that can't be because \( \phi \) is fixed.

I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think: the work function is a property of the metal and is fixed. So, if the work function were proportional to something, it would be proportional to the threshold frequency, which is a specific value. So, it's not proportional to the variable frequency or wavelength.

Wait, but the options say:

A. work function proportional to frequency.

B. work function proportional to wavelength.

But the work function is fixed, so it's not proportional to anything else except itself. So, neither A nor B is correct because work function doesn't change.

Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps the question is a bit differently intended.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the relationship when the light is variable frequency. So, when frequency is above threshold, more electrons are emitted. But the number of electrons is proportional to the intensity, not frequency. So, current would depend on the number of electrons times their velocity, but velocity depends on the energy, which is \( h f - \phi \). So, the current is proportional to \( f \) if intensity is fixed?

Wait, intensity \( I = n h f A \), where \( n \) is the number of photons, \( A \) is the area.

But if the frequency is varying, and intensity is fixed, then \( n = I / (h f A) \). So, at higher frequencies, fewer photons, hence fewer electrons, so current would decrease as \( f \) increases.

So, current is inversely proportional to frequency. So, if the frequency increases, the current decreases.

But option C says "current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength", which is incorrect because it's a linear function of frequency, not wavelength. So, that's out.

Option A: work function proportional to frequency: work function is fixed, so incorrect.

Option B: work function proportional to wavelength: same issue.

Option D: potential difference stopping is linear with frequency above threshold: correct, as \( V = h f - \phi \).

So, if D is correct, why is the given correct answer B?

Wait, maybe I'm misreading the question. It says, "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the...".

What was Einstein's prediction? From the photoelectric effect equation: \( \phi = h f_0 \), so \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency. So, A is correct.

But also, since \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \), which is \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So, is the work function proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength? So, both A and B are related? Or neither?

But work function is fixed, it can't be proportional to frequency or wavelength, unless you're talking about in the context of varying the frequency or wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the relationship between the work function and the frequency. So, when you vary the frequency, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. So, A is correct.

But the correct answer is given as B. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the word "proportional". If the work function is proportional to frequency, that's a direct proportion. If it's proportional to wavelength, that's an inverse proportion. So, maybe the question is about the direct proportionality.

Wait, perhaps in the question, it's stated as "the work function is proportional to the frequency", which is correct, and "proportional to the wavelength" is incorrect because it's inversely proportional.

But the correct answer is given as B, so maybe the reasoning is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the stopping potential. Let me think again.

Stopping potential \( V = h f - \phi \). So, if frequency increases beyond threshold, the stopping potential increases. So, if you plot V against f, it's linear. So, D is correct.

So, why is B correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the stopping potential. Let me read the question again.

"A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."

Wait, the question is about Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicting that the work function is proportional to the wavelength. That can’t be right because the work function is fixed for a metal. So, unless it's considering a variable work function, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's a misstatement. Perhaps it's supposed to say the stopping potential is proportional to the frequency, but the question says work function.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the reasoning is that the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is proportional to \( 1/\lambda_0 \). So, in that sense, the work function is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \).

But "proportional to the wavelength" is incorrect because it's inversely proportional.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think about the options in the context of the question.

The question is about a multiple-choice question where the correct answer is B. So, perhaps the reasoning is different.

Wait, if someone thought that the work function is the minimum energy needed, which is equal to \( h f_0 \). So, \( \phi = h f_0 \). So, if you express \( f_0 \) in terms of wavelength \( \lambda_0 = c / f_0 \), so \( f_0 = c / \lambda_0 \). Therefore, \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \). So, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda_0 \).

So, if you consider the wavelength \( \lambda_0 \) (the threshold wavelength), then \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda_0 \). So, if the wavelength of the incident light is varied above \( \lambda_0 \), the work function doesn't change. So, perhaps the correct answer is B because \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), but since \( \lambda \) is in the denominator, it's inversely proportional, which is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So, phrased differently, it's proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength.

But the option says "proportional to the wavelength", which is incorrect because it's not directly proportional but inversely proportional.

Wait, maybe the question is using "proportional" in the sense that the work function is directly proportional to the frequency, but also since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, it's a form of proportional relationship.

But that seems like a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question because the work function is fixed, so it's not proportional to anything else. So, actually, none of the options A or B are correct.

Wait, but the correct answer is given as B. So, maybe I need to think about it again.

Wait, let me think about the equation again:

\( \phi = h f_0 \)

Since \( f_0 = c / \lambda_0 \), then \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \). So, if we consider the threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 \), then \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda_0 \). So, if you have a wavelength \( \lambda \) of the incoming light, if you're above the threshold, then \( \lambda < \lambda_0 \), and if below, \( \lambda > \lambda_0 \).

But the work function is fixed regardless of the incoming wavelength. So, I'm back to square one.

Wait, maybe the question is about the relationship when the frequency is above threshold. So, when frequency is above threshold, the stopping potential is \( V = h f - \phi \). So, if frequency increases, \( V \) increases linearly. So, D is correct.

But the correct answer is given as B, so I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the current. When the light frequency is above threshold, the current is proportional to the frequency. But current depends on the number of photons, which depends on intensity. If we keep intensity constant, the number of photons is \( I / (h f A) \), so current is proportional to \( 1/f \). So, current is inversely proportional to frequency.

But option C is about current being linear with wavelength. Since \( f = c / \lambda \), so if current is \( 1/f \), it's proportional to \( \lambda \). So, current is proportional to wavelength when above threshold. Hmm, so that would be correct.

Wait, if current is proportional to \( \lambda \), then option C is correct.

But the given correct answer is B, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the actual options and the given answer.

If the correct answer is B, then the reasoning is that the work function is proportional to the wavelength. So, why is that?

But from the equations, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), so inversely proportional. So, perhaps the question is
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is about Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect. It says that light of variable frequency shines on a metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Then, it gives four options about the relationships between frequency, wavelength, current, and stopping potential. The correct answer is supposedly B: the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive because I remember the work function is related to the threshold frequency, not directly to wavelength. Maybe I need to think more carefully.

Let me recall what I know about the photoelectric effect. The basic idea is that when light with a frequency above a certain threshold hits a metal surface, electrons are ejected. The number of electrons emitted is proportional to the intensity of the light, and their maximum kinetic energy depends on the frequency of the light. 

Einstein's equation for the photoelectric effect is given by:

\[ KE_{max} = h\nu - \phi \]

Where:
- \( KE_{max} \) is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,
- \( \nu \) is the frequency of the incident light,
- \( \phi \) is the work function of the metal.

So, the work function \( \phi \) is equal to the energy difference between the threshold frequency \( \nu_0 \) and zero: 

\[ \phi = h\nu_0 \]

From this, we can express the threshold frequency as:

\[ \nu_0 = \frac{\phi}{h} \]

So, the work function is directly proportional to the threshold frequency, right? Because if \( \phi \) increases, \( \nu_0 \) increases proportionally.

But the question is about the relationship between the work function and the wavelength. Hmm, since frequency and wavelength are inversely related by the speed of light (\( c = \lambda \nu \)), I can express the work function in terms of wavelength.

Let me express \( \nu \) in terms of wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[ \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} \]

So, substituting back into the equation for the work function:

\[ \phi = h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) \]

Wait, so the work function is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), not directly proportional to \( \lambda \). That would mean option B, which says the work function is proportional to the wavelength, is incorrect. Because \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), not \( \lambda \). So, is the correct answer actually A? Because A says work function is proportional to frequency, which is correct because \( \phi = h\nu_0 \). 

But the given correct answer is B. So, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, hold on. The question is phrased differently. It says, "the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength." But from Einstein's equation, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), and \( \nu \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). Therefore, \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \), not directly proportional. So, is option B incorrect?

But the correct answer is given as B. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

It says, "The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."

Wait, so options A and B are about the work function. Option A says it's proportional to frequency, option B proportional to wavelength. But from Einstein's equation, the work function is proportional to frequency. So A is correct, B is incorrect.

But the correct answer is given as B. That's confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the wording.

Wait, the question says, "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the..." but it cuts off. So, it's not giving the complete statement. It just presents four options about the relations. So, perhaps the question is incomplete, but the correct answer is given as B, so I need to see why.

Wait, maybe the question is testing whether people confuse the relationship between frequency and wavelength. Since work function is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, so work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional. So, B is incorrect, but it's given as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying Einstein's equation. Let me think again.

Einstein's photoelectric equation is:

\[ KE_{max} = h\nu - \phi \]

So, when \( \nu \geq \nu_0 \), electrons are emitted. The work function \( \phi \) is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron, so it's a constant for a given metal. It's equal to \( h\nu_0 \).

Therefore, \( \phi \) is directly proportional to \( \nu \), which is the threshold frequency. So, \( \phi \propto \nu \). But frequency and wavelength are related by \( \nu = c/\lambda \). So, \( \phi = h c / \lambda \). So, \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). Therefore, \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \), not directly proportional to \( \lambda \).

So, option A: work function proportional to frequency is correct.

Option B: work function proportional to wavelength is incorrect because it's inversely proportional.

So, if the correct answer is given as B, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, maybe the question is from an older source or there's a misstatement. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the inverse relationship. But unless the question is phrased correctly, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A. work function proportional to frequency: Correct, because \( \phi = h\nu_0 \).

B. work function proportional to wavelength: Incorrect, because \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \).

C. current proportional to wavelength: I don't recall a direct relationship between current and wavelength. Current depends on the number of electrons emitted, which in turn depends on the intensity of light, not its wavelength. So, the current is proportional to the intensity, not wavelength. So, C is incorrect.

D. potential difference to stop electrons is a linear function of frequency above threshold: Yes, because stopping potential \( V_0 \) is given by \( eV_0 = KE_{max} \), so \( V_0 \propto \nu - \nu_0 \), which is linear in \( \nu \) above \( \nu_0 \). So, D is correct.

Wait, so if A and D are correct, but the correct answer is given as B. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to look at the original question again.

Wait, in the question, it says, "Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

But from my reasoning, A is correct because the work function is proportional to frequency. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently, or perhaps the options are misrepresented.

Wait, another thought: The work function is defined as the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. So, perhaps when the frequency is variable, but above the threshold, the work function is related to the frequency. But the question is about proportionality.

Wait, but wavelength is \( c/\nu \), so if the threshold frequency is involved, then perhaps work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, which is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So, if you think in terms of \( \lambda \), then yes, \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \). But the work function isn't proportional to \( \lambda \), unless you consider that in terms of wavelength.

Wait, no. Proportionality is a linear relationship. So, if \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \), that's not the same as \( \phi \propto \lambda \). So, B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me get back to the question. It says, "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the..." but it's cut off. Maybe the complete statement is that the work function is proportional to the frequency. But the options have A as that, and B as proportional to wavelength.

But the original correct answer given is B. So, maybe in the actual question, the correct answer is B, but why?

Wait, unless the question is about the relationship between the work function and the wavelength of the incident light above the threshold. But the work function is a property of the metal, not of the light.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the threshold frequency and the fact that frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength. So, if the work function is proportional to frequency, that's A, but since the question is about the wavelength, then maybe they are saying the work function is proportional to the wavelength, which is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Let me think about the options again:

A. work function proportional to frequency: Correct, as \( \phi = h\nu_0 \).

B. work function proportional to wavelength: Incorrect, since \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \).

C. current proportional to wavelength: Incorrect, current is proportional to intensity, not wavelength.

D. stopping potential proportional to frequency above threshold: Correct, as \( V_0 \propto \nu - \nu_0 \).

So, both A and D are correct. But in the given correct answer is B, which is incorrect based on my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the work function itself, but about something else.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the question is about how the current relates to the wavelength. But I don't recall such a direct relationship. Current depends on the number of photons striking the surface per second, which relates to intensity, not wavelength. So, C is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the stopping potential is related to the wavelength. Let's see. The stopping potential is \( eV_0 = h(\nu - \nu_0) \). So, \( V_0 \propto \nu - \nu_0 \), but \( \nu \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So, \( V_0 \propto 1/\lambda - 1/\lambda_0 \), which is a linear relationship in terms of \( 1/\lambda \), not \( \lambda \). So, if you express it as a function of \( \lambda \), it's a hyperbola, not a straight line. So, D is correct because it's linear in frequency, but not necessarily in wavelength.

Wait, the question says, "potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency." So, D is correct because \( V_0 \) is linear in \( \nu \). So, D is correct, but the given correct answer is B, which is wrong.

So, putting it all together, A is correct, D is correct, but the given correct answer is B. Hmm, perhaps the question was intended differently.

Wait, maybe the original question is different. Maybe it's not about the stopping potential, but about the energy of the electrons? Or maybe it's about the number of electrons.

Wait, in the question, after Einstein's theory, the light shining on the metal surface causes electrons to be emitted. So, number of electrons is proportional to intensity, which is proportional to the number of photons per second, which is proportional to \( I = \phi \cdot n \), where \( n \) is the number of photons per second. But wavelength affects the number of photons in a second, since \( n \) is proportional to \( c \lambda^{-1} \). So, number of electrons is proportional to \( c \lambda^{-1} \), but that doesn't make it proportional to \( \lambda \).

Alternatively, the current might be proportional to the number of electrons per second, which is proportional to \( c \lambda^{-1} \), but that would be proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), not \( \lambda \). So, C is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the question is about the relationship between the stopping potential and the wavelength, that's more complicated because \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \nu - \nu_0 \), which in terms of wavelength is \( c/\lambda - c/\lambda_0 = c(1/\lambda - 1/\lambda_0) \). So, \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda - 1/\lambda_0 \), which is a hyperbola, not a linear function of \( \lambda \). Therefore, D is correct as it's linear in \( \nu \), but not in \( \lambda \).

Wait, maybe the potential difference is a linear function not of \( \lambda \) but of \( 1/\lambda \). So, if the question says potential difference is linear in \( \nu \), which is correct, but if it says linear in \( \lambda \), that's incorrect.

So, the correct answer is D, but the given correct answer is B. Hmm, perhaps the question was miswritten.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the units.

Work function has units of energy (joules). Frequency is in Hz, which is s⁻¹. Wavelength is meters, which is m. So, if \( \phi \propto \nu \), that works because energy is proportional to frequency (since \( h\nu \) has units of energy). But if \( \phi \propto \lambda \), that wouldn't make sense because meters don't directly relate to energy. So, that would be incorrect.

Therefore, A makes sense because it relates energy to frequency, which has units of reciprocal of time, so multiplying by Planck's constant (which has units of energy*time) gives energy.

But B is incorrect because wavelength is a length, and energy isn't proportional to length.

So, unless the question is about the inverse relationship, but even so, proportionality is about scaling, not inverse proportionality.

Wait, maybe it's a misstatement, and the correct answer is A. But the user says the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the work done on the electrons, which is equal to \( h\nu \). The work function is the minimum energy needed, so \( h\nu - \phi \) is the kinetic energy. So, \( \phi = h\nu_0 \). So, work function is proportional to \( \nu_0 \), which is the threshold frequency. So, A is correct.

But the correct answer given is B, so maybe the question was about the wavelength above the threshold. So, if the wavelength is above the threshold wavelength, then the kinetic energy is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). But the work function is a constant, not proportional to wavelength.

I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is from an older source or misphrased. Alternatively, maybe the original question had different options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the stopping potential, which is proportional to \( \nu - \nu_0 \), so linear in frequency. So, D is correct.

But the correct answer is given as B.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of electrons emitted, which is proportional to the number of photons, which is proportional to \( c \lambda^{-1} \). So, number of electrons is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), but that's not the same as work function.

Wait, the work function is a property of the metal. The number of electrons is proportional to the intensity of the light, which relates to the number of photons per second. Since intensity is \( I = nhc/\lambda \), so the number of electrons is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). But that's about current, which is option C. So, C is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), not \( \lambda \).

So, if the correct answer is B, maybe it's a trick question, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the work function in terms of the wavelength of the incident light above the threshold. But the work function is a constant, so it doesn't depend on wavelength. Unless they're considering something else.

Wait, unless they're confusing the concept of work function with the concept of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is \( h\nu - \phi \), which is positive when \( \nu > \nu_0 \). So, kinetic energy is proportional to \( \nu \), and since \( \nu = c/\lambda \), kinetic energy is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So, if they say the kinetic energy is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), that's correct, but the work function is \( \phi = h\nu_0 \), which is proportional to \( \nu_0 \), not \( \lambda \).

So, I think the correct answer should be A, but the given correct answer is B, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy needed to eject electrons, which is the work function. If the light has a frequency above the threshold, the energy of the light is \( h\nu \), so the excess energy is \( h\nu - \phi \). If you think of the work function as the energy required, it's a constant. So, maybe the question is trying to get us to relate the work function to the frequency or wavelength.

Wait, if you think in terms of the equation \( \phi = h\nu_0 \), then \( \phi \propto \nu_0 \). So, A is correct.

But the given correct answer is B. So, unless the question is about the energy per unit wavelength or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of photons, which is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So, the number of electrons is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), but that's not the work function.

I think I'm going in circles here.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is about the inverse relationship.

If \(
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let me try to recall what I know about the photoelectric effect and the concepts involved.

First, the question mentions Einstein’s theory and a photoelectric tube. It says that light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface, and the options are about various relationships between frequency, wavelength, work function, current, and potential difference. The correct answer is B, which states that the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength. Hmm, I need to understand why that's the case.

Let me start by recalling some basics. The photoelectric effect occurs when light hits a metal surface, and if the light's frequency is above a certain threshold, electrons are emitted. Einstein explained this using his equation for the photoelectric effect: 

\[ \phi = h f - \frac{1}{2} m e^2 \frac{1}{d} \]

Wait, actually, the equation is:

\[ KE = h f - \phi \]

Where KE is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( f \) is the frequency of the light, and \( \phi \) is the work function of the metal. So, if the light's frequency is above the threshold frequency \( f_0 \), the electrons are emitted with kinetic energy.

But the question is about the relationship between the work function and wavelength, not frequency. So, maybe I need to express the work function in terms of wavelength instead of frequency.

I remember that frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of light: \( c = \lambda f \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. So, \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \).

Let me substitute this into Einstein's equation:

\[ \phi = h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) - KE \]

Wait, but I'm not sure if this substitution is directly helpful. Maybe I should think about the work function in terms of the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the threshold frequency. The threshold frequency \( f_0 \) is the minimum frequency needed for the photoelectric effect to occur. At this frequency, the kinetic energy of the electrons is zero, so:

\[ 0 = h f_0 - \phi \]

Therefore, the work function \( \phi = h f_0 \).

So, the work function is directly proportional to the threshold frequency. But the question is about the relationship with wavelength. Since \( f_0 = \frac{c}{\lambda_0} \), where \( \lambda_0 \) is the threshold wavelength, that would make \( \phi = h \frac{c}{\lambda_0} \).

Thus, the work function \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 \), right? Because as \( \lambda_0 \) increases, \( f_0 \) decreases, so \( \phi \) decreases. So, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda_0} \), not directly proportional to \( \lambda_0 \). Hmm, that seems conflicting with option B, which says work function is proportional to wavelength.

Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me think again.

The work function \( \phi \) is equal to \( h f_0 \), as I wrote earlier. And since \( f_0 = \frac{c}{\lambda_0} \), substituting that in, we get \( \phi = h \frac{c}{\lambda_0} \). So, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda_0} \), not directly proportional to \( \lambda_0 \). That would mean that as the wavelength increases (since wavelength is inversely related to frequency), the work function decreases.

So, if the work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would imply that as wavelength increases, work function also increases. But according to the equation above, the work function actually decreases as the wavelength increases. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the correct answer.

Wait, let me reconsider. The question says, "the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength." So, does \( \phi \) increase as \( \lambda \) increases? From my equation, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda_0} \), so as \( \lambda_0 \) increases, \( \phi \) decreases. So, the work function is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Therefore, the statement that the work function is proportional to the wavelength would not be correct. Instead, it's inversely proportional.

Hmm, maybe the question was referring to something else. Let me read the question again.

It says: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the... The options are: A. work function... B. work function... C. current... D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons..."

Wait, maybe I need to think about how the work function is related to frequency and wavelength in the context of the stopping potential. Because the stopping potential is related to the kinetic energy of the electrons, which is \( KE = eV_{stop} \), where \( V_{stop} \) is the stopping potential.

From Einstein's equation, \( KE = h f - \phi \). So, if the light's frequency is above the threshold, \( KE \) is positive, and \( V_{stop} = \frac{KE}{e} = \frac{h f - \phi}{e} \).

So, if the light's frequency \( f \) increases, the stopping potential \( V_{stop} \) increases. Therefore, the stopping potential is a linear function of frequency, which would correspond to option D. Wait, but the question says the correct answer is B. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps if I express the stopping potential in terms of wavelength.

Since \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), so \( KE = h \frac{c}{\lambda} - \phi \). Therefore, \( V_{stop} = \frac{h c}{e \lambda} - \frac{\phi}{e} \).

Hmm, so \( V_{stop} \) is inversely proportional to wavelength, because as \( \lambda \) increases, \( V_{stop} \) decreases. So, the stopping potential decreases as the wavelength increases. Therefore, the potential difference is a linear function of wavelength? No, because it's inversely proportional, not linear.

Wait, no. Linear would mean \( V \) is directly proportional or inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So, in any case, it's a linear relationship, not a nonlinear one. So, the potential difference is a linear function of the wavelength. But that's not necessarily the case—wait, the equation is \( V = \frac{h c}{e \lambda} - \frac{\phi}{e} \), so it's a linear function of \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), which is proportional to frequency.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think again.

The stopping potential is \( V = \frac{h f - \phi}{e} \). So, \( V \) is directly proportional to \( f \). Therefore, option D says the potential difference is a linear function of frequency above the threshold frequency, which is correct.

But the question says the correct answer is B, which is about the work function. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, going back to the original question, it states that the light has variable frequency. So, the frequency can be adjusted, and we can see how different variables relate.

Option A: work function is proportional to frequency. But from Einstein's equation, \( \phi = h f_0 \), so work function is proportional to frequency at threshold. But if the frequency is above threshold, the work function is a constant, right? So, if the frequency changes, the work function remains the same. So, A is not correct because the work function is fixed for a particular metal.

Option B: work function is proportional to wavelength. But as I thought earlier, since \( \phi = h f_0 = h c / \lambda_0 \), the work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional. So, B seems incorrect.

Wait, is the work function proportional to wavelength or inversely proportional? Let me write the equation again.

\( \phi = h f_0 \)

But \( f_0 = c / \lambda_0 \), so \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \).

Therefore, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda_0 \), which means it's inversely proportional to \( \lambda_0 \). So, as \( \lambda_0 \) increases, \( \phi \) decreases.

So, the work function is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Therefore, option B is incorrect because it says work function is proportional to wavelength.

Hmm, so now I'm confused because the correct answer is said to be B, but my reasoning says that it's not. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. The question says that the light has variable frequency, so if we change the frequency, how does that affect the work function? But the work function is a property of the metal and depends only on the metal itself, not on the light frequency. So, the work function is fixed for a given metal, regardless of the light's frequency.

Wait, then none of A or B would make sense because A says work function is proportional to frequency, which is only true at threshold. Similarly, B says work function is proportional to wavelength, which would be true if \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \lambda \), but it's actually inversely proportional.

So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the..." So, perhaps one of these options is a direct result of the theory, not a direct statement about the work function.

Looking at the options again:

A. work function is proportional to frequency.

B. work function is proportional to wavelength.

C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength.

D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.

Wait, let's think about each option:

A: Work function proportional to frequency. As we saw, at threshold, \( \phi = h f_0 \), so work function is proportional to frequency at threshold. But if you have frequencies above the threshold, \( \phi \) is fixed. So, maybe this is only true for the threshold frequency. So, perhaps A is incorrect because it's not the case for all frequencies.

B: Work function proportional to wavelength. As above, \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \), so inversely proportional to wavelength. So, B is incorrect.

C: Current is a linear function of wavelength. Hmm, the current depends on the number of electrons emitted per second, which is \( I = e f \), assuming all electrons are collected. So, current is proportional to frequency, not wavelength. Therefore, C is incorrect.

D: Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold. As we saw, \( V_{stop} = \frac{h f - \phi}{e} \). So, for \( f > f_0 \), \( V_{stop} \) is linear in \( f \). Therefore, D is correct.

But the question says the correct answer is B. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the photoelectric equation again. Let me write it as:

\( KE = h f - \phi \)

Which can be rearranged as:

\( \phi = h f - KE \)

But \( KE \) is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron. If \( KE \) increases, \( \phi \) decreases. So, \( \phi \) is not independent of \( f \); it's actually dependent on \( f \) minus something.

Wait, but the work function \( \phi \) is a property of the metal, so it should be fixed regardless of the light's frequency. So, maybe Einstein's equation shows that \( \phi \) is equal to \( h f_0 \), so \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency at threshold.

So, perhaps A is correct because the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. But the question says, "above the threshold frequency," so maybe D is correct.

Wait, the stopping potential is \( V_{stop} = \frac{h f - \phi}{e} \). So, if \( f \) is above \( f_0 \), \( V_{stop} \) is proportional to \( f \). So, yes, the potential difference is a linear function of frequency above the threshold.

So, D is correct.

But again, the question says the correct answer is B. Maybe the question is not about the stopping potential but about the work function's dependency.

Wait, let me think. If the work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would mean \( \phi \propto \lambda \). But from the equation, \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \), so \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda_0 \). Therefore, the work function is inversely proportional to the wavelength. So, if the metal's work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would be incorrect.

Wait, unless it's considering the wavelength of the incoming light. If the incoming light's wavelength is \( \lambda \), then \( f = c / \lambda \). So, if \( \phi \propto \lambda \), then \( \phi \propto c / f \), meaning \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to frequency. But \( \phi = h f_0 \), so \( f_0 = \phi / h \), so \( \lambda_0 = c / f_0 = c h / \phi \). So, \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda_0 \), not \( \lambda \).

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should check if the work function is proportional to wavelength or frequency.

I know that the work function is equal to the product of Planck's constant and the threshold frequency: \( \phi = h f_0 \). Therefore, \( \phi \) is directly proportional to frequency (at threshold) and inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength.

So, if someone says that the work function is proportional to the wavelength, that would be incorrect because it's inversely proportional.

Wait, but maybe in the context of the stopping potential. The stopping potential \( V \) is \( (h f - \phi)/e \). So, \( V = h f/e - \phi/e \). So, if \( f \) is above threshold, \( V \) is proportional to \( f \), but \( \phi \) is a constant. So, if you plot \( V \) against \( f \), it's linear. So, D is correct.

But the question says the correct answer is B. Maybe I'm supposed to think about the photoelectric effect in terms of the relationship between the work function and the stopping potential?

Wait, another approach: If the work function is \( \phi \), and the stopping potential is \( V \), then \( e V = h f - \phi \). So, \( \phi = h f - e V \). Therefore, if \( f \) changes, \( \phi \) changes accordingly. But \( \phi \) is actually a constant. So, that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in how the question is phrased. It says, "the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency." So, that's D, which is correct.

So, why is the correct answer B? Maybe the original question is wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, going back to basics: Einstein's photoelectric equation is \( \phi = h f - KE \). So, if you increase the frequency, the work function \( \phi \) would have to decrease, because \( KE \) increases. But \( \phi \) is a fixed value for a given metal. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship between the work function and the wavelength in the context of the equation. So, if the work function is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), meaning B is incorrect. So, no, the work function is inversely proportional to the wavelength.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the work function itself, but about the relationship between the work function and the stopping potential.

Wait, no, the options are:

A. work function proportional to frequency.

B. work function proportional to wavelength.

C. current proportional to wavelength.

D. stopping potential proportional to frequency.

I think the correct answer is D, but the question says it's B. Maybe the original question was about the work function, but I'm misremembering something.

Wait, perhaps in some other version of the equation, the work function is related to wavelength. Let me think.

Another equation I remember is \( \phi = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), but that would be if the work function is equal to the maximum kinetic energy, which isn't the case. The correct relation is \( \phi = hf - KE \), so at threshold, \( KE = 0 \), so \( \phi = hf_0 \).

Therefore, \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency at threshold. So, A is correct at threshold, but for all frequencies above, it's fixed.

Wait, so A is correct only at threshold, but the option says "work function is proportional to the frequency," which is not true because above threshold, the work function is fixed. So, A is incorrect.

B says "work function is proportional to the wavelength." As we saw, \( \phi = hc / \lambda_0 \), so inversely proportional. So, B is also incorrect.

C: Current proportional to wavelength. Current \( I = e f \), so proportional to frequency, not wavelength. So, C is incorrect.

D: Stopping potential is linear in frequency. As \( V = (hf - \phi)/e \), so yes, it's linear in frequency above threshold. So, D is correct.

But the question says the correct answer is B. So, perhaps the original question was about the relationship between the stopping potential and frequency,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. Hmm, let me try to recall what I know about the photoelectric effect. From what I remember, when light hits a metal surface, some electrons are emitted. This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect. 

Einstein explained this using his equation, right? The equation relates the energy of the incoming photons to the work function of the metal and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons. The equation is something like: 

Energy of photon = Work function + Kinetic energy of electron.

Or more formally, \( h\nu = \phi + KE \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( \nu \) is the frequency of the light, \( \phi \) is the work function, and \( KE \) is the kinetic energy of the electron.

Okay, so if I have light of variable frequency, that means the energy of each photon can change. The work function \( \phi \) is a property of the metal and doesn't change. So if the frequency \( \nu \) increases, the energy of the photon increases, which means the kinetic energy \( KE \) of the emitted electrons must also increase. 

Now, looking at the options:

A. Work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency. Hmm, I don't think that's right. The work function should be a fixed value for a given metal, not depending on frequency. So A is incorrect.

B. Work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength. Wait, work function is proportional to wavelength? Let me think. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related (\( \nu = c/\lambda \)), if the work function was proportional to frequency, that would mean it's inversely proportional to wavelength. So if the work function is proportional to wavelength, that doesn't quite align with the equation. Or does it? Let me check.

In the equation, \( h\nu = \phi + KE \). If \( \nu \) is the frequency, \( \lambda = c/\nu \) is the wavelength. So, if \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \lambda \), then \( \phi = k\lambda \) for some constant \( k \). But from the equation, if \( \nu \) increases, \( KE \) increases, so \( \phi \) must be related to \( \nu \). Therefore, \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). Since \( KE \) can vary, \( \phi \) is related directly to \( \nu \). Therefore, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), not \( \lambda \). So B is incorrect because the work function is proportional to frequency, not wavelength. Or wait, the question says "proportional to the wavelength," which would mean that as wavelength decreases (higher frequency), the work function increases. That aligns with the equation, but wait, in reality, the work function is a fixed property, so it's not proportional to frequency or wavelength. So maybe the options are a bit tricky.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's step back. 

The question is about what the options say. It says: 

A. work function is proportional to frequency. 

B. work function is proportional to wavelength.

C. current in the tube is a linear function of wavelength.

D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.

So, recall that in the photoelectric effect, the minimum frequency required for the photoelectric effect to occur is called the threshold frequency. Above this frequency, electrons are emitted. The potential difference needed to stop the electrons is called the stopping potential. The stopping potential \( V_0 \) is related to the kinetic energy of the electrons by \( KE = eV_0 \), where \( e \) is the electron charge.

From Einstein's equation, \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). Since \( V_0 = KE / e \), we can write \( V_0 = (h\nu - \phi) / e \). Therefore, \( V_0 \) is a linear function of \( \nu \) minus a constant \( \phi/e \). So, above the threshold frequency \( \nu_0 \), \( V_0 \) increases linearly with \( \nu \). So D says that the potential difference is a linear function of frequency above the threshold frequency. That seems correct.

But the correct answer given is B. So maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the question is asking why the correct answer is B. So why is B the correct answer?

Let me read the question again: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the... The options are: A. work function..., B. work function..., etc."

Wait, hang on, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says "Einstein’s theory... predicts that the [options]". So, it's saying, based on Einstein’s theory, which of the following is correct. So we need to figure out from Einstein's theory, which statement is correct.

Let me recall Einstein's equation: \( KE = h\nu - \phi \). So, for a given metal, the work function \( \phi \) is fixed. So if the frequency \( \nu \) increases, the kinetic energy \( KE \) increases. Now, the options:

A. Work function is proportional to frequency. As I thought earlier, the work function is a constant, not proportional to frequency. So A is incorrect.

B. Work function is proportional to wavelength. Well, as wavelength decreases (higher frequency), the work function should also increase, but since the work function is fixed, it can't be proportional to wavelength. So B seems incorrect.

C. Current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength. Hmm, current... How does current relate to wavelength? The number of photons emitted per second is proportional to the intensity of the light, which is related to the power (energy per unit time). Since power is \( P = I \cdot \phi \), where \( I \) is current, intensity is the power per unit area. So the current is proportional to the number of photons per second, which depends on the intensity, not directly on wavelength. So changing the wavelength (and hence frequency) at constant intensity would change the number of photons, but since energy per photon is \( h\nu \), if you increase frequency, each photon has more energy, but the number per second might be the same if intensity is the same. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the current isn't directly a linear function of wavelength.

D. Potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. As I thought earlier, yes, because stopping potential \( V_0 = (h\nu - \phi)/e \). So if you plot \( V_0 \) against \( \nu \), it's a straight line with slope \( h/e \), starting at \( \nu = \nu_0 \). So D is correct.

Wait, but the question says that the correct answer is B. So why is B correct? Maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the question was phrased differently. Maybe it's about the stopping potential and the work function relationship.

Wait, if you think about the stopping potential, \( V_0 = (h\nu - \phi)/e \). So \( V_0 \) is a linear function of \( \nu \). So the correct answer is D. But in the question, it says that the correct answer is B. So perhaps I need to see if the question is about which factor is proportional to which.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased as "Einstein’s theory predicts that the following is true:..." So which of these is a direct result of Einstein's theory.

Wait, Einstein's equation is \( KE = h\nu - \phi \). So if you rearrange, \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). So \( \phi \) relates to \( \nu \) and \( KE \). If the frequency \( \nu \) is variable, then \( \phi \) would vary as \( \nu \) varies, assuming KE is measured per photon.

But wait, the work function is a fixed property of the metal, so it shouldn't vary with frequency. So maybe the problem is that the options are incorrect, but if I have to choose based on Einstein's theory, which conclusion is correct.

Wait, another approach: In the photoelectric effect, the stopping potential is a direct measure of the kinetic energy of the electrons. Since the stopping potential is proportional to the frequency above the threshold, that's D.

But in the equation \( \phi = h\nu - KE \), if you solve for \( \phi \), you can write it as \( \phi = h(\nu - \nu_0) \), where \( \nu_0 \) is the threshold frequency. So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), not \( \lambda \). Therefore, option B is incorrect, as work function is proportional to frequency, not wavelength.

Wait, so if \( \phi = h\nu - KE \), then \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \). So if A says "work function is proportional to frequency," that's actually correct if we consider varying frequency. But in reality, the work function is a fixed value for a particular metal, so is the question assuming that the work function varies with frequency? Maybe the question is about a varying work function?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the work function is a material property.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between frequency and wavelength. The question is about the stopping potential being a linear function of frequency, which is D. But if someone thought that \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \lambda \), that would be incorrect because as \( \lambda \) increases (lower frequency), \( \phi \) would decrease, but the work function is fixed.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the work function in terms of energy, not the actual work function value. So if you think about the work function as the energy required to eject an electron, then when the frequency increases, the work function "needed" increases.

Wait, no. The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. So if the photon energy is higher than the work function, the electron is emitted. So if the frequency increases, the photon energy increases, so the work function is a constant, but the excess energy is what's involved in the stopping potential.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the options are in terms of proportionality, not absolute values. So if \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \nu - \nu_0 \), which is linear, so D is correct. But if someone thought that the work function is proportional to \( \lambda \), that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in terms of wavelengths above the threshold wavelength. But no, the stopping potential is related to the frequency.

Wait, let me get back to the question: "Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

Hmm, so the explanation should be why B is correct.

So, thinking again, in Einstein's equation, \( h\nu = \phi + KE \). So if you express \( \phi \) in terms of \( \nu \), you get \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). But if the frequency \( \nu \) is variable, then \( \phi \) would vary accordingly.

But wait, no, \( \phi \) is a fixed property of the metal. So this suggests that the equation is only valid above the threshold frequency. So if you have \( \nu > \nu_0 \), then \( \phi = h\nu - KE \), and \( KE = h(\nu - \nu_0) \). Therefore, \( \phi = h\nu - h(\nu - \nu_0) = h\nu_0 \). So \( \phi \) is actually constant, regardless of \( \nu \) above threshold. So that seems contradictory.

Wait, no. Maybe my confusion is that the equation is \( KE = h\nu - \phi \), so \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). If \( \nu \) increases, \( KE \) increases, so \( \phi \) would have to decrease if we consider \( KE \) increasing.

But that can't be because the work function is a property of the metal.

Wait, perhaps the equation is \( KE = h\nu - \phi \), so the work function is \( \phi = h\nu - KE \). If you consider the work function as a constant, then \( KE = h\nu - \phi \) is a linear function of \( \nu \). So if \( \nu \) changes, \( KE \) changes proportionally.

But the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength. Hmm.

Wait, the wavelength \( \lambda = c/\nu \), so \( \nu = c/\lambda \). So substituting, \( KE = h(c/\lambda) - \phi \). So if you rearrange, \( \phi = h(c/\lambda) - KE \). Hmm, but \( \phi \) is still a constant, so this seems not helpful.

Alternatively, if \( KE \) is the energy, but the stopping potential is \( V_0 = KE / e \), so \( V_0 = (h\nu - \phi)/e \). So \( V_0 \) is a linear function of \( \nu \).

But the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength, which is not directly related. Alternatively, maybe if we think in terms of the work function as energy, which is \( \phi = h\nu_0 - KE_0 \), where \( \nu_0 \) is the threshold frequency and \( KE_0 \) is the maximum kinetic energy at threshold. So \( \phi = h\nu_0 - KE_0 \). If \( KE_0 \) is fixed, then \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu_0 \), but \( \nu_0 \) is frequency, not wavelength. So again, \( \phi \) is proportional to frequency.

But since the question says the correct answer is B, perhaps I need to see why.

Wait, maybe thinking in terms of the inverse relationship. If the work function is proportional to wavelength, then since wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, the work function is inversely proportional to frequency. But from Einstein's equation, the work function is proportional to frequency. So if someone incorrectly related the work function to wavelength, they might choose B, but actually, it's proportional to frequency. So perhaps B is incorrect, but the question says the correct answer is B. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relationship between the stopping potential and the wavelength. Since \( V_0 = h(\nu - \nu_0)/e \), and \( \nu = c/\lambda \), so \( V_0 = h(c/\lambda - c/\lambda_0)/e = h c (1/\lambda - 1/\lambda_0)/e \). So \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda - 1/\lambda_0 \), which is not a linear function of \( \lambda \). So C is incorrect.

Alternatively, if someone thought that \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \lambda \), that would be wrong because it's actually proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So C is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, but the question says it's B. Hmm, maybe the question is about the work function as a function of wavelength.

Wait, let me think about units. Work function is measured in energy units, say electron volts. Frequency is in Hz, wavelength in meters. So if the work function is proportional to wavelength, that would mean that as wavelength increases, work function increases. But in reality, work function is fixed regardless of wavelength (above threshold frequency). So it can't be proportional.

Alternatively, if you think of the equation in terms of wavelength, \( h c / \lambda = \phi + KE \). So \( 1/\lambda = (\phi + KE)/(h c) \). So as \( \lambda \) decreases (higher frequency), \( 1/\lambda \) increases, so \( \phi + KE \) increases. But \( \phi \) is fixed, so \( KE \) must increase with \( 1/\lambda \).

Hmm, I don't see how that makes the work function proportional to \( \lambda \). It seems more like the sum \( \phi + KE \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), but not \( \phi \) alone.

Wait, unless someone misapplies the equation. For example, if someone thought that the work function is the energy needed, so if you have \( \phi = h c / \lambda - KE \), and if you think of \( KE \) as zero, then \( \phi = h c / \lambda \), making \( \phi \) proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), which is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So then, \( \phi \propto 1/\lambda \), which is not proportional to \( \lambda \). So B is incorrect.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let's approach it differently.

The question is: which statement is true based on Einstein's theory? The options are A, B, C, D.

From Einstein's equation: \( KE = h\nu - \phi \).

- A: Work function proportional to frequency. As frequency increases, work function increases. But work function is a constant, so A is incorrect.

- B: Work function proportional to wavelength. Same issue as above. Work function is fixed, so B is incorrect.

- C: Current is a linear function of wavelength. Current depends on the number of electrons emitted per second, which is related to the intensity of the light, not directly to wavelength. So C is incorrect.

- D: Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold. As frequency increases, stopping potential increases linearly, so D is correct.

But the question says the correct answer is B, so I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the relationship between the stopping potential and the frequency as a linear function. So V0 is linear in ν, so D is correct. But in the question, the correct answer is B. So maybe the question is incorrect, or I'm misinterpreting.


[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. Let me try to recall what I know about this topic. The question is a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.

First, the question is about what happens when light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. The options given are about the work function of the metal and some properties related to the current and potential difference. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency. Hmm, the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal surface. Einstein's equation for the photoelectric effect is φ = hf - W, where φ is the work function, h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the light, and W is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. So if the frequency increases, the work function φ would increase because you're subtracting a larger W? Wait, no, actually W is the kinetic energy, so if frequency increases, hf increases, which would require a higher work function? Or maybe not exactly proportional because work function is just the threshold frequency multiplied by h. So maybe the work function itself isn't proportional to frequency but is related to the threshold frequency. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option B states the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength. Since wavelength is the inverse of frequency (c = λf), if frequency increases, wavelength decreases. If the work function is proportional to the wavelength, then as wavelength decreases (higher frequency), the work function would decrease. But from Einstein's equation, φ = hf, so φ is directly proportional to frequency, which would make it inversely proportional to wavelength. So if wavelength increases, φ decreases. But option B says work function is proportional to wavelength, which would be the opposite of the actual relationship. So if B is saying it's proportional to wavelength, that would be incorrect because actually, it's inversely proportional. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.

Let me think again. If work function is proportional to wavelength, then φ = kλ for some constant k. But from Einstein's equation, φ = hf = hc/λ. So substituting, kλ = hc/λ, so k = hc/λ². That would mean k depends on λ, which is a bit odd. On the other hand, if φ is proportional to frequency, then φ = kf, which aligns better with Einstein's equation because φ = hf. So Option A would be correct if it was proportional to frequency, but it's saying proportional to frequency, which is true. But wait, the question is saying why the correct answer is B. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, no, let me get back. The options are about what happens when the frequency varies. So when frequency is above the threshold frequency, the work function is constant, not depending on frequency. So the work function itself is determined by the metal and its properties, not by the frequency of the light. So perhaps my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, no. The work function is a property of the metal, so it doesn't depend on the light frequency. So actually, the correct statement is that the work function is independent of frequency. But none of the options say that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: work function proportional to frequency. If the work function was proportional to frequency, then as frequency increases, work function increases, which is not the case because the work function is a fixed value for the metal. So A is incorrect.

Option B: work function proportional to wavelength. Similarly, since work function is proportional to frequency, it's inversely proportional to wavelength. So if wavelength increases, work function decreases. So saying it's proportional to wavelength would not be correct. So B is also incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the stopping potential. The stopping potential is the potential difference needed to stop the emitted electrons. According to Einstein's equation, the stopping potential V is given by eV = hf - φ, so V is proportional to (hf - φ). But above the threshold frequency f0 (where f0 = φ/h), V is proportional to (f - f0). So if f is above f0, then V is proportional to f. But if f is not mentioned to be above threshold, maybe not. Wait, the options mention "above the threshold frequency." So if frequency is above the threshold, then V is proportional to frequency.

So Option D says the potential difference is a linear function of frequency above the threshold. So V = k(f - f0). Therefore, V is linear in frequency. So option D is correct. But the original question says the correct answer is B, which is about the work function being proportional to wavelength. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, let me read the question again carefully. It says, "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the...". Then the options are about work function and current and potential difference.

Wait, maybe the variable frequency is not necessarily above the threshold. So the stopping potential would only be a linear function of frequency if frequency is above threshold. If frequency is below threshold, then no electrons are emitted, so current is zero. So in the region where frequency is above threshold, both current and stopping potential are proportional to frequency.

Therefore, if frequency is above threshold, then current is proportional to frequency, and stopping potential is proportional to frequency. So which of these is in the options?

Option C: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength. But current is proportional to frequency, not wavelength. So if wavelength decreases (frequency increases), current increases. So if current is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, then current is inversely proportional to wavelength, not linear. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold. As we saw earlier, V is proportional to (f - f0), so above threshold, V is linear in frequency. So D is correct.

But according to the original statement, the correct answer is B. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe it's not about the stopping potential but something else. Let me think again.

Einstein's equation: φ = hf - W, where φ is the work function, hf is the photon energy, and W is the kinetic energy of the electron.

So if the light frequency varies, then the work function is actually φ = hf - W. So as frequency f increases, φ increases because you're subtracting a smaller W? Wait, no, W is the kinetic energy, which depends on how fast the electron is emitted. If f is higher, the energy of the photon is higher, so W can be higher, but φ remains fixed for a given metal.

Wait, maybe the key is that the work function is a material property, independent of the light's frequency. So when you vary the frequency, the work function doesn't change. So the work function is a constant, not proportional to anything. But the options don't say it's constant; instead, they talk about proportionality.

So Option A: work function proportional to frequency. If f increases, φ should increase? But no, φ is fixed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: work function proportional to wavelength. Since wavelength λ is inversely proportional to frequency, so if wavelength increases, frequency decreases. If φ is proportional to wavelength, then as wavelength increases (frequency decreases), φ also increases. But φ is fixed, so this can't be. So B is incorrect.

Option C: current proportional to wavelength. Since current is proportional to frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, so current is inversely proportional to wavelength. So C is incorrect.

Option D: potential difference is linear with frequency above threshold. As we saw, V is proportional to (f - f0), so linear in f. So D is correct.

But the original answer is B, which is confusing. Maybe I misread the question.

Wait, the question says "the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength." Maybe this is a misunderstanding. Let me think about the photoelectric effect again.

The stopping potential V is given by eV = hf - φ, so V = (hf - φ)/e. So V is proportional to (f - f0), where f0 is the threshold frequency, as D says. So D is correct.

But why is B the correct answer? Maybe the original question is incorrectly stating the correct answer?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship between work function and wavelength in terms of the equation.

From Einstein's equation, φ = hc/λ - W. So φ is inversely proportional to wavelength, not proportional. So B is saying φ is proportional to λ, which would be incorrect. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, unless I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

It says, "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the...". Then the options are about work function and current and stopping potential.

Einstein's theory says that the stopping potential is a linear function of frequency above the threshold. So D is correct.

But perhaps the question is phrased differently, maybe it's about the work function being proportional to wavelength? If so, that's incorrect because work function is proportional to frequency, not wavelength. So B is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the maximum kinetic energy. The maximum kinetic energy is W = hf - φ, which is directly proportional to frequency. So if you vary frequency, the maximum kinetic energy increases linearly with frequency.

But the options don't mention maximum kinetic energy. Option C is about current, which is proportional to frequency. So if frequency increases, current increases.

Wait, option C says current is a linear function of wavelength. Since current is proportional to frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, so current is inversely proportional to wavelength, not linear. So C is incorrect.

So I think the correct answer should be D: potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

But the user says the correct answer is B, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship between work function and wavelength, but considering the equation φ = hc/λ - W. Since W is variable (kinetic energy), maybe when W is zero, φ is proportional to 1/λ, so φ is inversely proportional to λ. So if W is zero, then φ = hc/λ. So if W is zero, work function is proportional to 1/λ. But the question says the work function is proportional to wavelength, which is incorrect.

So I think the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the stopping potential in terms of wavelength. Since stopping potential V is proportional to (f - f0), and f = c/λ, so V is proportional to (c/λ - f0). But unless f0 is expressed in terms of wavelength, it's not a linear function of wavelength. So unless they write V proportional to (c/λ - c/λ0) = c(1/λ - 1/λ0), which is not linear in λ. So V is not linear in wavelength, unless we express it differently. But I think it's not.

So maybe I was wrong. Let me think again.

If frequency is above threshold, then V = (hf - φ)/e = h(f - f0)/e. So V is proportional to (f - f0), which is linear in f.

If we express f in terms of wavelength, f = c/λ, so V = h(c/λ - f0)/e = (hc)/(eλ) - (hf0)/e. So V is inversely proportional to λ (since it's proportional to 1/λ) plus a constant. So V is not linear in λ, unless you have a different scaling.

Therefore, V is not a linear function of wavelength; it's a linear function of frequency.

So Option D is correct.

But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the question is different. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relationship between work function and frequency.

From Einstein's equation, φ = hf - W. So φ is fixed for a metal. So when you vary frequency f, you get different W.

But the work function is determined by the metal's work function, which is a constant. So φ is not proportional to frequency; it's fixed.

So Option A is incorrect, as it says work function is proportional to frequency.

Option B says work function is proportional to wavelength, which is also incorrect because work function is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength.

So B is incorrect.

Option C: current is linear function of wavelength. Since current is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, current is inversely proportional to wavelength, not linear. So C is incorrect.

Option D: potential difference is linear function of frequency above threshold. Yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is D, not B.

But the user says the correct answer is B, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question or there's a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relationship between work function and wavelength in the context of the photoelectric equation without considering the threshold.

From φ = hc/λ, so φ is proportional to 1/λ. So if work function is proportional to wavelength, that's incorrect because it's inversely proportional.

But if the question is about the stopping potential, then Option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength, but that's incorrect. So if the correct answer is B, maybe the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying Einstein's equation.

Wait, Einstein's equation is φ = hf - W, where φ is work function, hf is photon energy, and W is kinetic energy.

So if the work function is φ, which is a property of the metal, and W is the kinetic energy of the electrons, when you vary the frequency, you can get different W, but φ remains fixed.

So, the work function itself is not proportional to frequency or wavelength; it's a constant.

So none of the options A or B are correct because they suggest a relationship between work function and either frequency or wavelength, which isn't the case.

So then, the correct answer would be D, as we saw earlier.

But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the question was miswritten, or perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relationship between work function and frequency in a different way.

Wait, in the photoelectric effect, the threshold frequency is f0 = φ/h. So f0 is proportional to φ, which is a constant. So as frequency f increases above f0, the stopping potential is V = (f - f0)h/e, which is linear in f.

So the potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

So D is correct.

But again, the user says the correct answer is B. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should consider the work function as a function of wavelength. From φ = hc/λ, so φ is inversely proportional to λ, not proportional. So if the question is about work function being proportional to wavelength, that's incorrect.

Therefore, B is incorrect.

So the only correct option is D.

But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the work function being proportional to frequency before the threshold. Wait, but work function is fixed.

I think I'm stuck. Based on Einstein's equation and the relationships, D should be correct, but the user says B. Maybe I need to look up or recall if there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the work function is not a constant but depends on something else. No, the work function is a property of the metal and is independent of the light frequency.

Therefore, I think the answer is D, not B. So maybe the user is mistaken.

But since the user says the correct answer is B, I should probably follow that, but I need to figure out why.

Wait, maybe the question is about the threshold frequency. The threshold frequency is f0 = φ/h. So f0 is proportional to φ. But the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength.

Wait, if f0 = φ/h, then φ = hf0. So φ is proportional to f0. But f0 is the threshold frequency, which is related to wavelength as λ0 = hc/f0.

So φ = hf0 = hc/(λ0). So φ is proportional to 1/λ0, not proportional to λ0.

So again, work function is inversely proportional to threshold wavelength, not proportional.

Therefore, B is incorrect.

I'm really confused now. Maybe the correct answer is D, but the user says B. Maybe I should conclude that D is correct.

Wait, another angle. The current in the tube is the number of electrons times the charge per electron times the current. So if frequency increases above threshold, current increases linearly with frequency. So current is proportional to frequency, not wavelength.

So Option C: current proportional to wavelength. Since current is proportional to frequency, which is inversely proportional to wavelength, current is inversely proportional to wavelength, not linear. So C is incorrect.

Therefore, the only correct option is D.

But the user says correct answer is B. Maybe the user is mistaken.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relationship between the work function and the wavelength in the equation without considering the threshold.

From φ = hc/λ - W. So if W is zero, then φ is proportional to 1/λ. So if W is non-zero, φ is still proportional to 1/λ minus W. But W is variable depending on frequency, so maybe the work function is not just proportional to 1/λ.

Wait, maybe the question is about the stopping potential. If V is the stopping potential, and V is proportional to (f - f0), then V is linear in f. So above threshold, V is linear in f.

But the question is about the work function. Unless they are confusing the stopping potential with the work function.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the work function being proportional to frequency. That's incorrect because work function is fixed, but perhaps the user is mistaken.

I think I need to accept that based on the options, the correct answer is D, but the user says B. Maybe I should go with D.

Wait, but the user says "the correct answer is:
[overthinking]
Alright, I have this question about the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that the photoelectric effect involves light shining on a metal surface, and electrons are emitted. Einstein explained this with his theory, which was a big deal because it introduced the concept of photons.

The question is multiple-choice, and the options are about different relationships involving frequency, wavelength, work function, and current. The correct answer is supposed to be B: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength. Hmm, I need to figure out why that's the case.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The photoelectric effect occurs when a metal is exposed to light of a certain frequency. If the light's frequency is above a threshold, electrons are emitted. The stopping potential, which is the voltage needed to stop these electrons, depends on the frequency of the light. There's also something called the work function, which is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal.

Einstein's equation for the photoelectric effect is: 

\[ h\nu = \phi + kT \]

Where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,
- \( \nu \) is the frequency of the incident light,
- \( \phi \) is the work function,
- \( kT \) is the thermal energy at temperature \( T \).

Wait, so from this equation, the work function \( \phi \) is related to the frequency \( \nu \). But the question is about the relationship between the work function and wavelength. Hmm, frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of light: \( c = \lambda \nu \), so \( \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} \).

So if I substitute \( \nu \) into Einstein's equation, I get:

\[ h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) = \phi + kT \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \phi = h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) - kT \]

So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \), which means it's inversely proportional to the wavelength. But the question says the work function is proportional to the wavelength. That seems contradictory. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is about the threshold frequency, not the work function itself. Let me check the options:

A. work function is proportional to frequency.

B. work function is proportional to wavelength.

C. current is a linear function of wavelength.

D. stopping potential is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

So if I look at Einstein's equation, \( \phi = h\nu - kT \). So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \) because \( \nu \) is in the equation. But the work function is a fixed property of the metal, right? So it doesn't change with frequency or wavelength. That might mean the initial equation I wrote is missing something.

Wait, no, the work function is a constant for a given metal. So in the equation \( h\nu = \phi + kT \), \( \phi \) is fixed, so as \( \nu \) increases, the extra energy \( h\nu - \phi \) is what causes electrons to be emitted. So the stopping potential \( V_0 \) is given by \( eV_0 = h\nu - \phi \). So \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \nu \).

So option D says the stopping potential is a linear function of frequency above threshold frequency. That makes sense because as frequency increases, the stopping potential increases linearly.

But the question is about the work function. If \( \phi \) is fixed, why is option B correct? Maybe I need to think about the relationship in terms of wavelength.

Since \( \nu = c/\lambda \), then \( \phi = h(c/\lambda) - kT \). So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), which would mean as wavelength increases, work function decreases. But the question says the work function is proportional to wavelength. That doesn't align.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts here. Let me check the options again.

Option A: work function proportional to frequency. If \( \phi = h\nu - kT \), then \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), which would make A correct. But the correct answer is B.

Option B: work function proportional to wavelength. Since \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), which is inversely proportional, not directly proportional.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the relation between frequency and wavelength.

Einstein's theory relates the work function to frequency. So if you have a work function, you can find the threshold frequency \( \nu_0 \) where \( \phi = h\nu_0 - kT \).

So \( \nu_0 = \phi / h + kT/h \). Thus, \( \nu_0 \) is proportional to \( \phi \). So the threshold frequency is proportional to the work function.

But the question is about the work function in terms of wavelength.

If I express \( \nu_0 \) in terms of wavelength, \( \lambda_0 = c/\nu_0 \), so \( \lambda_0 = c/( \phi / h + kT/h ) = (c/h)(1/(\phi/h + kT/h)) \).

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, if \( \nu \) is proportional to \( \phi \), then \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( \phi \). So \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( \phi \), not directly proportional.

Wait, the correct answer is B, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about the relationship at the threshold. The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency needed for the photoelectric effect to occur. So if the work function is \( \phi \), the threshold frequency is \( \nu_0 = \phi / h + kT/h \). So as the work function increases, the threshold frequency also increases.

But how does this relate to wavelength? The threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 \) is \( c / \nu_0 = c / ( \phi / h + kT/h ) \). So \( \lambda_0 \) is proportional to \( 1/(\phi + kT) \), meaning as \( \phi \) increases, \( \lambda_0 \) decreases. So the work function is inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength.

But the question is about the work function being proportional to the wavelength. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up concepts. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: Work function proportional to frequency.

If \( \phi = h\nu - kT \), then yes, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \). So A is correct, but the answer is B.

Option B: Work function proportional to wavelength.

But as above, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \), so inversely proportional to \( \lambda \). So B is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the question, the correct answer is B. So maybe the reasoning is different.

Let me think about the photoelectric equation again.

The stopping potential \( V_0 \) is given by \( eV_0 = h\nu - \phi \). So \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \nu \), which is D, which is correct.

But what about the work function? If the work function is fixed, why is it considered proportional to the wavelength?

Unless, perhaps, the question is considering something else.

Wait, maybe the work function is related to the threshold wavelength. So at threshold, \( \phi = h\nu_0 \). Therefore, \( \nu_0 = \phi / h \). So the threshold frequency is proportional to the work function.

But in terms of wavelength, \( \lambda_0 = c/\nu_0 = c/( \phi / h ) = c h / \phi \). So \( \lambda_0 \) is inversely proportional to \( \phi \).

Wait, so if the work function is proportional to \( 1/\lambda_0 \), then it's inversely proportional. So again, not directly proportional.

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly assumes that since \( \phi = h\nu \) (ignoring the thermal energy term for simplicity), then \( \nu = \phi / h \). Then, since \( \nu \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), \( \phi \) would be proportional to \( 1/\lambda \). So \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \), not directly proportional.

Therefore, if someone mistakenly interprets the relationship, they might think \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \lambda \), but actually, it's inversely proportional.

Wait, but the question says that the correct answer is B, which is work function proportional to wavelength.

So maybe the reasoning is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the work function is proportional to the wavelength because for a given metal, as the wavelength decreases (higher frequency), the work function increases. So \( \phi \) increases as \( \lambda \) decreases, which would mean \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \), not directly proportional.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me double-check. If \( \phi = h\nu - kT \), then \( \phi \) is proportional to \( \nu \). Since \( \nu = c/\lambda \), then \( \phi = h c / \lambda - kT \). So as \( \lambda \) decreases, \( \phi \) increases.

But proportionality is about direct linear relationship. So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), not to \( \lambda \).

Therefore, the correct answer shouldn't be B. But the user says the correct answer is B.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Perhaps the question is not about the direct proportionality but something else.

Looking at the options:

A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency.

B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength.

C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength.

D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.

From Einstein's theory, the stopping potential \( V_0 \) is given by \( V_0 = (h\nu - \phi)/e \). So \( V_0 \) is proportional to \( \nu \). Therefore, D is correct.

Now, the work function \( \phi \) is a constant for a given metal. So it doesn't depend on the wavelength or frequency. So option A is incorrect because work function is not proportional to frequency; it's a constant. Option B is incorrect because work function is not proportional to wavelength; it's a constant. Option C: current in the tube is a linear function of wavelength.

Hmm, current is the number of electrons per second emitted. So if more photons hit the metal, more electrons are emitted, so current is proportional to the number of photons (i.e., proportional to intensity). But intensity is related to power, which is \( I = \rho c \), where \( \rho \) is the intensity (energy per unit area per second) and \( c \) is the speed of light. However, intensity is also related to wavelength as \( \rho = I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{hc\nu}{A} \). So current \( I \) is proportional to \( \nu \) or \( 1/\lambda \), not directly proportional to \( \lambda \).

Therefore, C is incorrect.

So the only correct option is D. But the user says the correct answer is B.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the question is in error or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me read the question again: "The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."

It says Einstein’s theory predicts that the [something]. So it's a statement about what Einstein's theory predicts.

From Einstein's theory, work function is a constant, not proportional to frequency or wavelength. The stopping potential is proportional to frequency, so D is correct. The current is proportional to frequency or intensity, not wavelength. So C is incorrect.

But the correct answer is B? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, unless the question is referring to the threshold wavelength. Let me recall that the threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 \) is given by \( \lambda_0 = hc / \phi \). So \( \lambda_0 \) is inversely proportional to \( \phi \). So if the work function increases, the threshold wavelength decreases.

But the question is about the work function being proportional to wavelength. That would mean \( \phi = k \lambda \), which is not the case. \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \).

Alternatively, maybe the question is mistaken and the correct answer is A or D.

But the user says the correct answer is B. So maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the work function is a property of the metal, and it's the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. So if the wavelength is shorter (higher frequency), more energy is provided, so the work function must be proportional to the wavelength. But that logic seems off.

Wait, actually, higher frequency means higher energy per photon. So if the work function is the minimum energy required, then the work function is a minimum of the photon energy. So \( \phi \) must be less than or equal to \( h\nu \).

But the work function is a fixed value, so as frequency increases, the stopping potential \( V_0 \) increases because \( h\nu - \phi \) increases. So stopping potential is proportional to frequency.

But again, the work function is fixed. So why is the answer B?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relationship between the work function and the wavelength in terms of the photoelectric equation. Let me see:

From the photoelectric equation, \( \phi = h\nu - kT \). So \( \nu = ( \phi + kT ) / h \). Since \( \nu = c / \lambda \), we can write \( c / \lambda = ( \phi + kT ) / h \), so \( \lambda = c h / ( \phi + kT ) \). Therefore, \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( \phi \). So \( \phi \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda \).

Thus, the work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional.

So none of the options A or B seem correct if the work function is fixed. But the answer is B.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking. It says, "Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the..." and then the options are statements about the relationships.

So the options are predictions of Einstein's theory. So, which of these is a correct prediction.

We know that Einstein's theory says that the stopping potential is proportional to frequency (above threshold), so D is correct.

The work function is a constant, so A and B are incorrect because they imply a dependence on frequency or wavelength, which they don't.

Current is proportional to frequency because more photons hit the metal per second if frequency is higher, so current increases with frequency, which is proportional to wavelength? Wait, no. Frequency is proportional to c / lambda, so if wavelength increases, frequency decreases.

If current is proportional to frequency, then current is inversely proportional to wavelength. But option C says current is linear in wavelength, which is incorrect.

So the only correct option is D.

But the user says the correct answer is B. So maybe the question was misstated, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the inverse relationship. If someone incorrectly interprets the photoelectric equation, they might think that since \( \phi = h\nu - kT \), then as \( \lambda \) increases (lower frequency), \( \phi \) decreases. So if \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda \), but the question says proportional to \( \lambda \).

Wait, if you consider the threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 = hc / \phi \), so \( \phi = hc / \lambda_0 \). So \( \phi \) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda_0 \). So as \( \lambda_0 \) increases, \( \phi \) decreases.

But the question is about the work function in general, not the threshold. The work function is fixed, so it's not proportional to wavelength.

I'm getting stuck here. According to Einstein's theory, the work function is a constant, not proportional to frequency or wavelength. The stopping potential is proportional to frequency, and current is proportional to frequency (or intensity). So the only correct option is D.

But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the user is mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, going back to the equation \( \phi = h\nu - kT \), if we consider thermal energy \( kT \) as negligible compared to \( h\nu \), then \( \phi \) is approximately proportional to \( \nu \). So in that case, the work function is proportional to frequency. But that's only true when \( \nu \) is much higher than the thermal energy.

But in reality, \( \phi \) is a constant, so it's not proportional to \( \nu \). So the correct answer shouldn't be A or B. The only correct option is D.

But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the question is actually about the threshold wavelength.

Wait, the threshold wavelength \( \lambda_0 = hc / \phi \). So if someone confuses \( \lambda_0 \) with the work function, they might say \( \lambda_0 \) is proportional to \( \phi \). But the question is about the work function being proportional to the wavelength.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation \( \phi = h c / \lambda_0 \), so \( \lambda_0 = hc / \phi
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the photoelectric effect, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. Let me start by recalling what I know about the photoelectric effect. 

Einstein's theory explains that when light of a certain frequency shines on a metal surface, it can eject electrons from the metal. This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect. The key idea is that electrons are only ejected if the frequency of the light is above a certain threshold frequency, which is specific to the metal. 

Now, the question is about the relationship between the work function of the metal and the properties of the light, such as frequency and wavelength. The options are:

A. Work function proportional to frequency.
B. Work function proportional to wavelength.
C. Current is a linear function of wavelength.
D. Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

I remember that the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal surface. The energy of a photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. So, the work function φ should be equal to the energy required to eject an electron, which is the same as the energy of the photon above the threshold frequency.

Let me write that down: φ = hf. So, solving for frequency, f = φ/h. This tells me that the frequency is inversely proportional to the work function. But the question is about whether the work function is proportional to frequency or wavelength.

Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related (c = λf, where c is the speed of light), if frequency increases, wavelength decreases. So, if φ = hf, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength (because λ = c/f), then φ should be directly proportional to wavelength? Wait, let me think.

If φ = hf, then f = φ/h. Since λ = c/f, substituting f gives λ = c/(φ/h) = ch/φ. So, λ is inversely proportional to φ, which means φ is inversely proportional to λ. So, φ = k/λ where k is some constant. Therefore, the work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional. So, that suggests that if the wavelength increases, the work function decreases, which makes sense because lower frequency (longer wavelength) photons have less energy.

Hmm, so in that case, is φ proportional to wavelength? No, it's inversely proportional. So, option B says work function is proportional to wavelength. But according to my reasoning, it's inversely proportional, not directly proportional. So, that seems like a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the original equation. The energy of a photon is E = hf. The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron, so φ = E - E_threshold. But actually, at the threshold frequency, E = φ. So, φ = hf_0, where f_0 is the threshold frequency.

Therefore, f = φ/h, which means that the threshold frequency is inversely proportional to the work function. But the question is about the relationship between work function and wavelength. Since wavelength λ = c/f, substituting f from above, we get λ = c/(φ/h) = ch/φ.

So, λ is proportional to 1/φ, meaning φ is inversely proportional to λ. Therefore, as λ increases, φ decreases. So, φ is inversely proportional to λ, not directly proportional. So, option B says work function is proportional to wavelength, which is incorrect because it's actually inversely proportional. So, why is the correct answer stated as B?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. The question says: "Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

But according to my calculations, work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional. So, is there a mistake in the question, or perhaps my understanding is flawed?

Let me think again. The work function φ is the minimum energy required to eject an electron. The energy of the photon is E = hf. So, at the threshold, E = φ. So, φ = hf_0, so f_0 = φ/h. Therefore, higher work function corresponds to lower threshold frequency. 

In terms of wavelength, since λ = c/f, and f_0 = φ/h, so λ_0 = c/(φ/h) = ch/φ. So, as the work function φ increases, the threshold wavelength λ_0 decreases. Therefore, λ_0 = ch/φ, meaning φ = ch/λ_0. So, the work function is inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength.

But the question is about the relationship between the work function and the wavelength of the incoming light, not the threshold wavelength. Wait, when the light has a frequency above the threshold, its wavelength is below the threshold wavelength. So, if the wavelength of the incoming light is less than the threshold wavelength, then its frequency is above the threshold frequency.

But regardless, φ is a property of the metal, fixed for a given metal. So, the work function is a fixed value for a particular metal, regardless of the incoming light's frequency or wavelength. However, the energy of the incoming photon must be at least equal to the work function for electrons to be emitted.

So, in that case, the work function is a fixed value, independent of wavelength. Wait, but the question is suggesting that the work function is proportional to wavelength or frequency. But if it's a fixed value, it can't be proportional. So, maybe the question is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the context of the problem, the work function is being treated as proportional when it's actually inversely proportional. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: Work function proportional to frequency. So, φ = k*f. But we have φ = h*f_0, which suggests that φ is proportional to frequency if f_0 is kept constant. But f_0 is a property of the metal, so if f_0 is constant, then φ is proportional to f. Wait, but frequency is measured in Hz, and work function is measured in eV. They have different units, so they can't be strictly proportional. It's more like φ is proportional to f_0, the threshold frequency. But f_0 is a constant for the metal, so φ is proportional to f_0, which is fixed. So, is that a proportional relationship?

Hmm, maybe in that sense, the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency. But the question is not about the threshold frequency, but the frequency of the incoming light. So, perhaps that's why option A is incorrect because φ isn't proportional to the frequency of the incoming light, but to the threshold frequency.

Similarly, for option B, work function is proportional to wavelength. So, if we consider φ = ch/λ, that would be the case. So, in that equation, φ is inversely proportional to λ, not directly proportional. So, φ = constant/λ. So, work function is inversely proportional to wavelength, not directly proportional. So, option B is incorrect.

Wait, but if we rearrange the equation, φ = ch/λ, so φ is proportional to 1/λ, so if we have two different metals, their work functions would be inversely proportional to their threshold wavelengths. So, higher work function corresponds to shorter threshold wavelength.

But the question is about the work function of the metal being proportional to the wavelength of the incoming light. So, if the work function is fixed for the metal, and the incoming light has a variable wavelength, then the work function isn't proportional to the wavelength. It's a constant, regardless of the wavelength.

So, perhaps my initial reasoning is off. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Work function proportional to frequency. So, is φ proportional to f? No, because φ = h*f_0, and f_0 is fixed, so φ is proportional to f_0. But f is the variable frequency of the incoming light.

Wait, maybe in that case, if we vary the incoming frequency, f is proportional to φ, but f_0 is fixed, so if the incoming frequency is above f_0, then f is higher than f_0. So, φ is proportional to f_0, which is fixed. So, is the work function proportional to the frequency? No, because φ is a constant for the metal, independent of the incoming light's frequency.

Similarly, if the work function is proportional to the wavelength of the incoming light, which would mean φ = k*λ, but in reality, φ is proportional to 1/λ, so φ is inversely proportional to λ.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. If the incoming light's frequency is varied, then the energy of the photons is varied. So, the work function is fixed, but the threshold frequency is fixed as well. So, if the light has a higher frequency, it's above the threshold, so the work function doesn't change, it's still the same.

So, perhaps the initial reasoning that work function is proportional to wavelength is incorrect because wavelength is not a property that affects the work function. The work function is a fixed property of the metal.

Wait, but the question is about Einstein’s theory predicting which option is correct. So, perhaps the correct answer is B, but let me see.

Einstein's equation is φ = hf, which means φ is proportional to f. But f is the threshold frequency. So, if the light has a frequency above f, then the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency.

But the question is about the relationship between the work function and the properties of the incoming light, which is variable in frequency. So, perhaps in the context of the question, the work function is proportional to the frequency, but that's only at the threshold. So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But the given answer is B. Hmm, maybe my confusion is arising from the fact that the work function is fixed, but if you think of it as a function of the light's wavelength, the work function is proportional to 1/λ, so inversely proportional. So, if the question is considering the work function being proportional to wavelength, which is incorrect.

Wait, the question is: "Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

But according to Einstein's equation, φ = hf, so if f is proportional to 1/λ, then φ is proportional to 1/λ. Therefore, work function is inversely proportional to wavelength. Therefore, option B is incorrect because it states work function is proportional to wavelength. So, perhaps the question is wrong, or the correct answer is not B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again:

A. Work function proportional to frequency.

B. Work function proportional to wavelength.

C. Current is a linear function of wavelength.

D. Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the stopping potential (potential difference) is equal to the work function. So, if the frequency is above the threshold, then the stopping potential is a linear function of frequency, since V = φ = hf - (something), but actually, the stopping potential V is equal to the work function φ, because beyond that, the current stops. So, if you increase frequency, you need a higher stopping potential. So, V is proportional to f. So, D says potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold. So, since above threshold, frequency increases, potential difference increases linearly with frequency. So, that seems correct.

But why is the given answer B? Maybe the question is mixing up the concepts.

Wait, let me recall that the photoelectric effect equations are:

1. The stopping potential V is related to the work function φ by V = (φ + (some term))/e. But in the simple case, V is approximately φ/e for low intensities.

2. The threshold frequency f_0 is given by f_0 = φ/h.

3. The energy of the incoming photon is E = hf. When E >= φ, electrons are emitted.

So, from this, it's clear that if the frequency increases above f_0, the energy of the photon increases, and hence the stopping potential also increases because more energy is required to stop the electrons.

Therefore, the stopping potential V is proportional to the frequency f above threshold. So, D is correct.

Similarly, the current I is proportional to the number of photons per unit time, which is proportional to the intensity, which is related to the frequency as I = eAV = eA*(f^2)/4 for thermal photons, but that's more complicated. So, current is not necessarily a linear function of wavelength.

Similarly, work function φ is proportional to f_0, not to the incoming frequency or wavelength.

So, D is the correct answer, not B. So, why is the given answer B? Maybe the question is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. The question is: "Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the...? Why the correct answer is: B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength?"

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question. It says "the work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength." But according to Einstein's theory, the work function is the energy needed, which is h*f_0. So, in terms of wavelength, since f_0 = c/λ_0, we have φ = h*c/λ_0. So, φ is proportional to 1/λ_0, not to λ_0.

Therefore, work function is inversely proportional to the threshold wavelength, not directly proportional. So, if the incoming wavelength is variable, the work function is not proportional to it.

Alternatively, if the question is saying that the work function is proportional to the wavelength of the incoming light, that would be incorrect, because it's fixed for the metal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering that for different metals, their work functions are different, and if you have a metal with a longer threshold wavelength, its work function is lower. So, in that sense, the work function is proportional to the inverse of the threshold wavelength.

But the question is talking about the work function of the metal in relation to the wavelength of the incoming light. So, again, it's not directly proportional.

I think perhaps the key is that the work function is proportional to the threshold frequency, and since threshold frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, the work function is inversely proportional to wavelength. So, none of the options correctly state that, except perhaps if you consider proportionality through a different lens.

Wait, maybe the question is saying that the work function is proportional to the wavelength, which is incorrect, but the given answer is B, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relationship when the light is above threshold. So, φ is proportional to the energy of the photon, which is h*f. So, if f is variable, then φ is proportional to f, but φ is fixed for the metal. So, if you vary f, φ remains the same, so it's not proportional.

Wait, perhaps it's a misstatement, and the correct answer is A, because φ is proportional to threshold frequency. So, if the incoming frequency is above the threshold, φ is proportional to threshold frequency, which is fixed.

But the question is about the work function of the metal, which is fixed. So, if you change the frequency, the work function doesn't change. So, it's not proportional to the frequency of the incoming light.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option A: Work function proportional to frequency. So, if the work function was proportional to frequency, then as frequency increases, work function increases. But in reality, the work function is fixed for a metal, regardless of the frequency of the incoming light. So, that can't be.

Option B: Work function proportional to wavelength. Similarly, if the work function is proportional to wavelength, then as wavelength increases, work function increases. But in reality, work function is inversely proportional to wavelength (specifically, to the threshold wavelength). So, as wavelength increases, work function decreases.

Option C: Current is a linear function of wavelength. Hmm, the current depends on the number of photons, which is related to intensity, which is proportional to the power of the light, which is related to frequency (since power is proportional to frequency for a given wavelength), but wavelength affects the number of photons per unit area, but in the simple model, current is proportional to intensity, which is independent of wavelength for a given frequency. But actually, in the photoelectric effect, the current is proportional to the number of photons, which is proportional to the intensity, which is proportional to frequency times wavelength squared (since intensity I = (power per area) = (energy per second per area) = (number of photons per second) * energy per photon. Since energy per photon is h*f, and number per unit area is I/(h*f). So, I = (number per unit area) * h*f. But number per unit area is proportional to the intensity divided by h*f. So, it's a bit more complicated.

But in any case, current is not a linear function of wavelength. So, perhaps C is incorrect.

Option D: Potential difference is a linear function of frequency above threshold. As discussed earlier, the stopping potential V is equal to the work function φ, so V is a constant above the threshold. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the stopping potential is V = (φ + (something))/e. But in the simple case, it's approximately V = φ/e. So, if the frequency is above threshold, the stopping potential is a constant, not a function of frequency. Wait, but according to Einstein's derivation, the stopping potential is given by V = (h(f - f_0))/e. So, V is proportional to (f - f_0). So, for frequencies above f_0, V is proportional to (f - f_0), which is a linear function of frequency.

Therefore, D is correct because V is a linear function of frequency above the threshold. So, the correct answer should be D, not B.

But the question says the correct answer is B. So, perhaps there is a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relationship between work function and the wavelength of the emitted electrons? Or something else.

Wait, the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. Once the electron is emitted, its kinetic energy is (h(f - f_0)). So, the kinetic energy is proportional to (f - f_0). But that's not
