[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about Louis De Broglie and his hypothesis relating the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. It's a multiple-choice question with options A through D: Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, The Rydberg constant, and the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be B, Boltzmann’s constant. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me recall what I know about De Broglie. I remember he was a Belgian physicist who proposed that every particle, like electrons, has a wavelength associated with it. This wavelength is related to its momentum. So, the basic idea is that there's a wave-particle duality, meaning particles like electrons can behave like waves, and waves have properties like wavelength.

Now, the equation that comes to mind is the De Broglie relation, which connects momentum (p) and wavelength (λ). I think it's p = h/λ, where h is Planck’s constant. So, if that's the case, then the constant involved is Planck’s constant, which is option A. But the question says the correct answer is B, Boltzmann’s constant. That doesn't seem to fit with what I remember.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. De Broglie did propose that particles have wave properties, and his equation was p = h/λ, right? So, h is Planck’s constant. Therefore, the relationship is between linear momentum and wavelength, and the constant is Planck’s constant. So, option A should be correct. But the question states that the correct answer is B. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Hold on, perhaps the question is about something else related to De Broglie. I know De Broglie also worked on wave mechanics and was involved in the development of the Schrödinger equation. But in terms of constants, it's usually Planck’s constant that's related to quantum mechanics.

Wait, is there another perspective? Maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? The Compton effect is when light scatters off electrons, and the wavelength shift is related to the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), where m is the mass of the electron and c is the speed of light. But that still involves Planck’s constant.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the relationship between momentum and wavelength in the context of photons, but no, photons have no rest mass, so their momentum is different.

Wait, the question says "free massive particle". So, it's a massive particle like an electron, not a photon. So, the relation should be p = h/λ. So, again, Planck's constant is involved. So, why is the correct answer supposed to be Boltzmann’s constant? That doesn't align.

Let me double-check the question: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So, the options are Planck’s, Boltzmann’s, Rydberg’s, speed of light. The correct answer is B, Boltzmann’s constant.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the constant with something else. Is there a reason why Boltzmann’s constant would be involved here? Boltzmann’s constant is related to the thermal energy in statistical mechanics, like k_B = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. It's also used in the formula for the radius of the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T). That's the thermal wavelength, not the particle's intrinsic wavelength.

So, perhaps the question is referring to the thermal wavelength? Because that involves Boltzmann's constant. But the question says "free massive particle" in general, not specifically thermal. Or maybe it's a trick question because sometimes in thermal physics, de Broglie wavelength is used with Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect, or there's a typo. If it's supposed to be the Compton wavelength or the thermal wavelength, then different constants are involved.

Wait, let me see. The standard De Broglie relation is p = h/λ, so h is involved. Therefore, A should be correct. Unless the question is referring to some other relationship where Boltzmann's constant comes in.

Alternatively, maybe it's not the linear momentum but the angular momentum? But the question says linear momentum.

Wait, could the question be referring to the momentum of a particle in terms of its wave nature in a different context? Or maybe in the context of diffraction, where the momentum transfer is considered? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in the question, the term "free massive particle" is key. If it's a free particle, it doesn't have any potential, so the energy is purely kinetic. But that still doesn't tie into Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant is used in the formula for the thermal wavelength, which is used in the context of statistical mechanics to describe the wavelength of particles in a thermal distribution. So, that wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T). So, that's where Boltzmann's constant comes in. But that's a specific case, not the general De Broglie hypothesis.

So, maybe the question is trying to trick me by making me think of thermal wavelength instead of the standard particle wavelength. So, if the question is specifically about the de Broglie wavelength in the context of thermal physics, then Boltzmann's constant is involved.

But the question doesn't specify thermal physics; it just says "free massive particle." So, that makes me think that it's a trick, or the question is incorrect. Or maybe the person who answered it considered the thermal wavelength?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), but that would involve the speed of light as well, which is another option. But in that case, the constant would be Planck’s, and the speed of light is a separate factor.

Wait, another thought: the original De Broglie hypothesis was that particles have wave properties, so the momentum is p = h / λ. So, unless the question is referring to something else, like the relation between wavelength and velocity or something, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, if we consider wave packets, the spread of position and momentum, but that involves uncertainties and the Heisenberg principle, which relates Planck’s constant to uncertainty in position and momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a misprint, and it's supposed to be about the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), so that would involve Planck’s constant and the speed of light. But that still doesn't bring Boltzmann into play.

Alternatively, if the question is about the relation in terms of energy, but then energy is related to momentum via E = pc, but that's another topic.

Wait, let me think about the derivation of the de Broglie wavelength for a free particle. The wave equation leads to a plane wave solution ψ = e^{i (p x - E t)/ħ}, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, h/(2π). But in the de Broglie relation, p is h / λ, so h is Planck’s constant.

Unless, the question is in the context of relativistic particles, but then momentum is still related to wavelength via p = h / λ.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the relation in the form λ = h / p, so the constant is Planck’s. So, if the question is about which constant is used, it's Planck's. So, why is the correct answer supposed to be Boltzmann's?

Wait, maybe the question is referring to another concept. Let me check.

Wait, in some contexts, like the Schrödinger equation for a free particle, the solution has a term involving the momentum operator, which is related to the derivative. But that doesn't directly tie into the constants involved.

Alternatively, perhaps if we consider probability density or something else, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and its wavelength in the context of interference or something, but that's still h.

Alternatively, if the particle is in a confined space, maybe like in a box, then the momentum is quantized, but that's a different scenario, and the quantization comes from boundary conditions, not from the constants themselves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a miscommunication, and the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in a different framework where Boltzmann's constant is involved.

Wait, another idea: in the context of the de Broglie wavelength for a photon, but photons don't have mass, so that doesn't apply here. The question says a free massive particle.

Wait, if it's a massive particle, maybe it's considering relativistic momentum? Because in relativity, momentum is gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, if we have a massive particle moving at a high speed, maybe the relation is different. But I don't recall a special relativistic version of the de Broglie relation that would involve Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is about the relation in terms of particle statistics, like the Fermi wavelength or Bose-Einstein wavelength, which is h / (sqrt(2π) m k_B T). So, in that case, it's the thermal wavelength, which involves Boltzmann's constant. So, for non-interacting particles in a gas, their average separation is on the order of the thermal wavelength, which is h / sqrt(2π m k_B T).

So, perhaps the question is referring to the thermal wavelength, which would involve Boltzmann's constant. But the question says "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength... are related by which constant?" So, it's specifically about the relation between momentum and wavelength, not thermal wavelength.

Hmm, maybe the question is incorrectly attributing the thermal wavelength as the de Broglie wavelength, hence incorrectly stating Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another concept. Let me think about the relation between mass and wavelength. If a particle is massive, then for a given momentum, the wavelength is longer or shorter. But that's still p = h / λ, so h is the key.

Wait, another thought: Planck’s constant is also related to the energy quanta. So, E = h ν, where ν is frequency. But that's again E = h / λ, so p = E / c, but that's another relation, not directly the de Broglie relation.

Wait, if we think of a photon, it's momentum is p = h / λ, but photons have no mass. So, for a massive particle, is the de Broglie relation similar? Yes, p = h / λ.

Alternatively, in the context of wave packets, the uncertainty principle involves Planck’s constant, but again, that's more of a general quantum mechanical concept.

Alternatively, the question may have a typo, and it's supposed to be about the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c). But again, that involves Planck's constant, not Boltzmann.

Alternatively, if the particle is in an electric potential, like in the hydrogen atom, but that's the Rydberg constant, option C. But the question is about a free massive particle, not bound.

Wait, so maybe the question is incorrect, or the answer is incorrect. Because according to the standard de Broglie relation, it's Planck's constant. So, unless the question is referring to a different relationship or a specific context where Boltzmann's constant is involved, which I can't think of right now.

Alternatively, perhaps the person answering confused the de Broglie wavelength with the Compton wavelength. But no, Compton wavelength is h/(m c), which is different.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relation in the form λ = h / p, so the constant is Planck’s. So, A is correct. If the question says the correct answer is B, maybe it's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and its wavelength in a periodic potential, but that's more about band structure and involves Bloch's theorem, not Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, in a magnetic field, the cyclotron frequency is related to the magnetic constant, but that's more of a classical concept.

Alternatively, if we think of the particle's wavelength in terms of its velocity, but that would involve c, which is the speed of light, another option. But no, the de Broglie relation is h / λ = p = mvγ.

Wait, in relativity, p = γ mv, where γ is the Lorentz factor, but that still doesn't tie into Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation between the particle's kinetic energy and its wavelength. So, kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), and if p = h / λ, then KE = h²/(2m λ²). But that still doesn't involve Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is considering the thermal energy, so KE = (3/2) k_B T, but that's combining kinetic energy with thermal physics, which introduces Boltzmann's constant. So, if we have p = h / λ and KE = (3/2) k_B T, then combining these, we can get an expression involving both h and k_B. But that seems convoluted.

So, the thought process is: If we have a free massive particle, its kinetic energy is related to its momentum, and if we also consider thermal energy, then perhaps the two constants are linked. But that seems like a stretch and probably not what the question is referring to.

Alternatively, maybe the person answering confused the de Broglie wavelength with the thermal wavelength. If so, the thermal wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T), so that involves Boltzmann's constant. But that's a different wavelength, not the intrinsic de Broglie wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly using the term "de Broglie hypothesis" when it's actually talking about the Compton wavelength or the thermal wavelength, but that would be an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relation between the particle's momentum and its wavelength in a medium, which might involve the speed of light as the medium's property. But the question says "free massive particle," so it's not in a medium.

Wait, another angle: in quantum mechanics, the momentum operator is related to the derivative, and the position operator to the coordinate. The eigenvalues of momentum are related to the coefficients in the wavefunction, but that's again not directly tying into constants.

Alternatively, if the particle is in a potential, the momentum is related to the kinetic energy, but that's not the same as the de Broglie relation.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the relation between the particle's rest mass and its wavelength? But that would involve the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), but again, Planck's constant is involved.

So, after going through all these possibilities, I can't see a direct connection between the de Broglie relation and Boltzmann's constant. The de Broglie relation is p = h / λ, so Planck's constant is the key. Therefore, unless there's a specific context or a miscommunication, the correct answer should be Planck’s constant, which is option A.

But the question says the correct answer is B, Boltzmann’s constant. Maybe the person answering confused Boltzmann's constant with Planck's. So, perhaps there was a mix-up in the options or the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a non-English source, and there was a translation error. Maybe it's supposed to say "relates momentum and wavelength" in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and its wavelength in a periodic system, but that's more about crystal momentum, which is a different concept.

Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the relation in terms of energy, where kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m) and p = h / λ, so combining those gives KE = h²/(2m λ²). But again, that's still Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is considering the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², but that doesn't tie into Boltzmann's constant either.

Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the relation in terms of frequency, where E = h f, which is similar, but still Planck's.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Maybe the key is that De Broglie's hypothesis was that particles have wave properties, and the momentum is p = h / λ, so the constant is Planck's. Therefore, the correct answer is A, not B. Maybe the question is wrong, or the given answer is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and wavelength in a different way, like in the context of wave packets, where the spread of the wave packet is related to Planck's constant, but that's more about the uncertainty principle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question because sometimes in thermal physics, the de Broglie wavelength is considered, which is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T), so that would involve Boltzmann's constant. But in that case, the question should specify thermal wavelength or something like that.

So, if the question is just about the general de Broglie relation, it should be Planck's constant. If it's about the thermal wavelength, then Boltzmann's is involved. Since the question says "free massive particle," it's more general, so Planck's constant is the answer. Therefore, maybe the given answer is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor, and v is velocity, but that's still not tied to Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and the wavelength in terms of the wave's amplitude or something else, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's a confusion between the de Broglie wavelength and the Compton wavelength, but again, Compton involves Planck's and speed of light.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the relation between the particle's momentum and wavelength in the context of the wavefunction's spread, but that's about wave packets and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates to Planck's constant and position-momentum uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the radius of a sphere in which a particle can be confined, but that's more about the uncertainty principle again.


[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about Louis De Broglie and his hypothesis relating the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The question is asking which constant connects these two properties. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, Rydberg constant, or the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be Boltzmann’s constant, but I need to figure out why.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about De Broglie's hypothesis. I remember that he proposed that every particle, like electrons or protons, has a wavelength associated with it, kind of like how light has waves. This wavelength is often referred to as the de Broglie wavelength. The formula for this wavelength is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle.

So, connecting momentum and wavelength would indeed involve Planck's constant, right? Because the formula uses h. But wait, the question is asking which constant is used to relate them. So maybe the key here is that h is Planck’s constant, which is option A.

But the answer given is B, Boltzmann’s constant. That confuses me a bit. Let me think deeper. Maybe I'm missing something here. So, the de Broglie equation λ = h / p does indeed involve Planck's constant. So why is the correct answer supposed to be Boltzmann's constant?

Wait, maybe it's a trick question. Let me go through each option:

A. Planck’s constant – Well, that does seem to be in the equation.

B. Boltzmann’s constant – Maybe in some other formula? Hmm.

C. Rydberg constant – That’s related to energy levels in atoms, I think.

D. The speed of light – That's c, which is about 3 x 10^8 m/s.

So, the de Broglie equation is λ = h / p, so h is Planck’s constant. So why is the correct answer not A?

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question. It says "which of the following constants" so h is Planck's constant, but maybe in different units or something? Or perhaps the question is referring to the relationship in a different way?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the formula λ = h / p but about how constants are used in different equations. Let me recall if there's any connection between the de Broglie hypothesis and Boltzmann's constant.

Boltzmann's constant is k, about 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. I don't see how that would directly relate to momentum and wavelength. Unless it's part of another equation or a derived formula.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misremembering the equation. Let me check: yes, the de Broglie equation is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant. So the correct constant seems to be Planck's, which is option A. So why is the answer B?

Wait, hold on. Maybe the question is phrased differently. It says "relate linear momentum and wavelength." So, if I rearrange the equation, p = h / λ. So, the product of momentum and wavelength is Planck's constant. So, they are inversely proportional with Planck's constant as the constant of proportionality.

So, that still points to Planck's constant. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion between energy and momentum. Because sometimes energy is related to h times frequency or wavelength. For example, E = h f or E = hc / λ. But that's about energy, not momentum.

Alternatively, is there another formula where momentum is related to another constant? I don't recall, but maybe for particles at relativistic speeds, but the question says free massive particle, so non-relativistic.

Wait, perhaps in some units system, like in natural units where c=1, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hold on, let me think about the units. Momentum has units of mass times velocity, kg m/s. Wavelength is in meters. Planck's constant has units of kg m²/s. So, when you divide h by p, you get meters, which is consistent.

But if you think about the units, h has units of energy times time, since E = h f, so h has units of kg m²/s. So, p has units kg m/s, so h / p has units (kg m²/s) / (kg m/s) = meters, which matches wavelength.

So, again, it's Planck's constant. So why is the answer supposed to be Boltzmann's constant?

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering the question. Let me reread it: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?"

Wait, is it possible that the question is using a different formula? For example, sometimes the wavelength of a particle is given by λ = h / p, but in terms of another constant, maybe in some approximation or in another form?

Wait, another thought: Planck's constant is h = 2πħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which is related to the momentum and involves the rest mass of the particle, but that would involve the speed of light and the rest mass. But the question says free massive particle, not necessarily the Compton wavelength.

Wait, the Compton wavelength is defined as ħ / (m c), where m is the mass of the particle and c is the speed of light. But again, that involves the speed of light, which is option D.

So, I'm still not seeing how Boltzmann's constant comes into play.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Planck's constant has units of J s, which is kg m²/s. Boltzmann's constant has units of J/K, which is kg m²/s K. So, they have similar units, but different numerical values. So, in terms of unit analysis, h and k are different constants.

So, unless the question is phrased differently, I don't see how k would be the constant relating momentum and wavelength.

Wait, maybe it's a typo or a misunderstanding in the question. Alternatively, the question might have mixed up energy and momentum.

Wait, another angle: in thermal physics, Boltzmann's constant is used in equations like energy = k T, but that doesn't relate to momentum or wavelength.

Alternatively, in the equation for the de Broglie wavelength, if we are using natural units where ħ = h / 2π, but that's still Planck's constant.

Wait, maybe it's about the relation between momentum and frequency? No, because momentum and frequency are related to wavelength through p = h f.

Wait, if the question is about the product of momentum and wavelength being equal to Planck's constant, then p * λ = h. So, the constant is Planck's.

But if the question is saying that the ratio of momentum to wavelength is Planck's constant, then p / λ = h. So, again, h is Planck's constant.

So, why is Boltzmann's constant the answer? Maybe the question is referring to a different formula or a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the relation in another form. For instance, sometimes the momentum can be related to the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which is a concept in statistical mechanics where particles have an effective thermal wavelength. That wavelength is given by λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T), but here, h is Planck's constant, m is mass, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. So, that formula does involve Boltzmann's constant.

But the original de Broglie hypothesis is about the wave nature of particles in general, not specifically about thermal wavelength. So, if the question is in the context of thermal physics, then yes, it would involve Boltzmann's constant. But the question just says "a free massive particle," which doesn't specify thermal context.

So, maybe the question is conflating the two concepts. The standard de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / p, which uses Planck's constant. But in the thermal case, the thermal wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T), which uses Boltzmann's constant. So, perhaps the confusion comes from that.

But if the question is only about the basic de Broglie wavelength, it should be Planck's constant. However, if it's in the context of thermal physics, it would be Boltzmann's constant.

Given that the correct answer is B, perhaps the intended context is the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which does involve Boltzmann's constant. So, maybe the question is assuming that, or it's a misinterpretation.

But as per the standard de Broglie hypothesis, it's h. So, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relation where kinetic energy is expressed in terms of momentum and wavelength. So, kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m) for non-relativistic particles. And the de Broglie wavelength relates p and λ through p = h / λ. So, you can write KE in terms of λ: KE = (h²)/(2m λ²). But that still involves Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if we set KE = k T, the thermal energy, then KE = k T = (h²)/(2m λ²). So, in that case, you can see that h is related to the other constants, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, if we write momentum as p = h / λ, then p is proportional to 1/λ. So, if you have a graph of p vs 1/λ, it's proportional to h. But that doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, unless the question is using another relation, like E = pc, but that's only for relativistic particles, which the question doesn't specify.

Alternatively, in the context of wave-particle duality, sometimes people use the concept of standing waves and wave packets, but I don't see how Boltzmann's constant would come into that.

Wait, another thought: maybe in some versions of the de Broglie equation, when you consider the uncertainty principle, you get an expression involving Planck's constant and Boltzmann's constant? I don't recall such a formula.

Wait, the uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, that again relates to Planck's constant.

Hmm, so I'm not really seeing the connection to Boltzmann's constant unless it's in the context of thermal wavelength, which is a specific concept in statistical mechanics.

Given that, maybe the question is conflating the two, but in reality, the standard de Broglie wavelength uses Planck's constant.

Wait, let me check online to verify. If I look up "de Broglie wavelength," it's defined as λ = h / p. So, Planck's constant h is involved.

If I look up "thermal wavelength," it's λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T), which does involve Boltzmann's constant k. So, that's a different concept.

So, why does the question say the correct answer is B? Maybe it's a typo or a mistake in the question.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another formula I'm not aware of.

Wait, is there a relationship where momentum is related to wavelength via another constant? I don't recall.

Alternatively, if the question was in a different language, perhaps the translation is off? But assuming it's correctly translated.

Alternatively, maybe it's considering the Compton wavelength, which is λ = h / (m c). So, h is Planck's constant, but that also involves the speed of light c. But that's another constant, so D would be involved.

But the Compton wavelength formula is λ = h / (p), because p = m v, but if you consider relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v, so it's more complicated.

Wait, but the Compton wavelength is specifically for electrons and is given by λ = h / (m_e c). So, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light.

So, that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is talking about the radius of the orbit in the Bohr model of the atom, but that uses the Rydberg constant, which is option C.

But that's about the Balmer series and energy levels.

Wait, perhaps if I think about the relation between momentum and energy, which is p = sqrt(2mE), but that's when E is kinetic energy.

But again, this is about energy, not wavelength.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the thermal wavelength, but that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a misprint and the intended correct answer was Planck’s constant, but it got miscopied as Boltzmann’s.

Alternatively, the confusion between h and k.

Wait, let me see. If I have p = h / λ, then multiplying both sides by λ gives p λ = h. So, the product of momentum and wavelength is Planck’s constant. So, the relation is p λ = h. So, h is the constant.

Therefore, the constant relating them is Planck’s constant. So, unless the question is referring to p λ being equal to h, which is Planck's constant, so A.

But if the answer is B, perhaps it's considering a different formula where the constant is k. But I don't see how that would be.

Wait, maybe in some cases, if you have p = (h / λ), and then if you relate that to energy, like E = p² / (2m), then you can write E = (h²) / (2m λ²). If you set E = k T, then you have k T = h² / (2m λ²). So, solving for h, h = sqrt(8 π m k T λ²). But that's a derived expression and involves h, not k.

Alternatively, solving for k, k = h² / (8 π m E λ²). But again, that doesn't make k the direct constant relating p and λ.

Wait, another angle: perhaps in the question, they are referring to the fact that when you have a particle with momentum p, its wavelength is λ = h / p, so p = h / λ. If you have two particles with the same mass, their wavelengths are inversely proportional to their momenta, with h as the constant. So, the constant here is h, which is Planck’s constant.

So, again, that would point to A.

But if the answer is B, then perhaps the question is considering a different relation where k is involved.

Wait, think about units again. The de Broglie wavelength has units of meters. So, if you have p in kg m/s, and λ in meters, then h has units kg m²/s. So, h is the only constant with the right units. If you tried to use Boltzmann’s constant, which has units of J/K, which is kg m²/s K, you would have to have some other term to convert units to just meters. But that's not a direct relation.

Alternatively, if we have h / (m k T), what would that give us? h has units kg m²/s, m is kg, k has units kg m²/s K, and T is K. So, h / (m k T) would have units (kg m²/s) / (kg * kg m²/s K * K) = (kg m²/s) / (kg² m²/s K²) = 1/(kg K). Which is not meters.

Alternatively, h / (m k) would have units (kg m²/s) / (kg * kg m²/s) = 1/kg, which is not meters.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. I think the only direct relation between momentum and wavelength is through Planck's constant.

So, unless the question is referring to a different concept, like the thermal wavelength, which does involve Boltzmann's constant, but that's not the general de Broglie wavelength.

Wait, let me think about the thermal wavelength formula again: λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T). So, here, h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's, m is mass, T is temperature. So, in that formula, both h and k are involved, along with mass and temperature.

So, in that formula, if you solve for h, you get h = λ sqrt(2 π m k T). So, h is expressed in terms of λ, m, k, and T. But that's a derived relation, not a direct relation between p and λ.

But again, the question is about the de Broglie hypothesis, which is λ = h / p, so h is the constant.

So, why is the answer supposed to be Boltzmann’s constant? I might be missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relationship between momentum and wavelength in terms of another constant. For example, in some contexts, when you have p = mv, and if you relate it to wavelength, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, and it should be Planck’s constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing the difference between de Broglie wavelength and Compton wavelength, but that still involves Planck's constant and the speed of light.

Wait, perhaps if you have a particle with momentum p, then its wavelength is λ = h / p, and if you have another particle with momentum p', then its wavelength is λ' = h / p'. So, the ratio of wavelengths is p' / p. So, the constant here is h, which is Planck's constant.

So, unless it's a different ratio, like energy or something else.

Alternatively, if we take the relation p = h / λ and solve for h, h = p λ, which is a constant. So, again, h is the constant.

So, I'm going around in circles here. If the question says the correct answer is Boltzmann's constant, perhaps it's a mistake. Because based on the standard de Broglie equation, it's Planck's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as n ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe it

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Louis De Broglie and his hypothesis relating linear momentum and wavelength in free massive particles. The question is asking which constant connects these two properties. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, the Rydberg constant, or the speed of light. The answer is supposedly B, Boltzmann’s constant, but I want to figure out why that is.

Let me start by recalling what I know about De Broglie. From what I remember, he proposed that all matter has a wavelength associated with it, called the de Broglie wavelength. This wavelength is related to the particle's momentum. So, the basic idea is that momentum (p) and wavelength (λ) are connected somehow. I think the equation is p = h/λ, where h is Planck's constant. Yeah, that rings a bell. So, does that mean the relationship is directly with Planck's constant?

Wait, but the answer given is B, Boltzmann’s constant. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think. Planck's constant is definitely a key player in quantum mechanics, especially in the photoelectric effect and the energy levels of atoms. But why would Boltzmann’s constant be the right answer here?

Hold on, maybe I need to consider the specific context of the question. It says "a free massive particle." So, does the mass of the particle affect the constant in the equation? Let me write down the equation I know: p = h/λ. So, if p is the momentum, which is mass times velocity (p = mv), then we can write mv = h/λ. Therefore, v = h/(mλ). But that still involves Planck's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else, like thermal de Broglie wavelength? Because I remember that particles like atoms or gases can have a de Broglie wavelength associated with their thermal motion, and that might involve Boltzmann's constant. Let me think about that.

So, thermal de Broglie wavelength is a concept where particles in thermal equilibrium have a wavelength associated with their thermal motion due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The formula for thermal wavelength is something like λ = h / sqrt(2πm k_B T), where m is mass, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. So, in this case, the relation involves Boltzmann's constant k_B.

But wait, the question is about a free massive particle, not necessarily thermal. Hmm, so is the question referring to thermal wavelength or the regular de Broglie wavelength? That might be the confusion here. If it's just the regular de Broglie wavelength for a free particle, then Planck's constant is directly involved. But if it's the thermal de Broglie wavelength, then Boltzmann's constant comes into play.

Looking back at the question: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" It doesn't specify thermal, so maybe it's the general case. Then, why is the answer Boltzmann's constant? That doesn't make sense because Planck's constant is in the equation.

Wait, perhaps it's a trick question or I'm misremembering. Maybe the correct formula is p = (h)/(λ), but sometimes in certain contexts, you might see other constants. Alternatively, maybe in the derivation or in some other form, another constant comes into play.

Wait, but let me think again. The original de Broglie hypothesis is p = h / λ. So, the relationship is directly with Planck's constant. So, Option A should be correct. But the answer given is B, Boltzmann’s constant. So, perhaps the question is about something else.

Hold on, is it possible that the question is actually referring to the relationship in terms of frequency? Because wavelength is related to frequency by λ = c / f, where c is the speed of light. Then, combining with p = h / λ, we can write p = h f / c. Since h f is the energy of a photon, that's Planck's constant times angular frequency. But that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if we are dealing with particles in thermal equilibrium, then the thermal wavelength formula does involve k_B, but the question specifies a free massive particle, not necessarily in thermal equilibrium. So, I'm still confused why the answer would be Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded or I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe it's not about the general de Broglie relation but something else. Let me check the question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are Planck’s, Boltzmann’s, Rydberg’s, and speed of light.

Hmm. So, the question is linking momentum (p) and wavelength (λ) via a constant. De Broglie's equation is p = h / λ, so the constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But the user says the correct answer is B. Maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps the question is referring to another concept.

Wait, the thermal de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T). So, if the question is about thermal wavelength, then it's h divided by something involving k_B. But the question is about a free massive particle in general, not thermal.

Wait a second, maybe the question is actually referring to the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's a different concept related to electron wavelength in atomic units. It doesn't involve Boltzmann's constant either.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between momentum and wavelength in terms of frequency or energy. But still, Planck's constant is involved.

Wait, could it be that the question is inverting the relationship? If you have λ = h / p, then perhaps they are referring to some other relation? Or maybe in terms of frequency or period? But I don't see how Boltzmann's constant would come into play.

Alternatively, is there a scenario where the momentum is proportional to 1/λ with Boltzmann's constant involved? Maybe in the context of statistical mechanics, where particles have an average wavelength associated with their motion, like thermal wavelength, and in that case, the formula does involve Boltzmann's constant.

But again, the question is about a free massive particle, not specifically thermal. So, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the question is misworded, and the relationship is between momentum and something else, like frequency or period, but then again, the question specifies wavelength.

Let me see. Maybe I need to think about the units or the constants involved. Planck's constant is in J·s, Boltzmann's is in J/K. So, if you have p = h / λ, both h and λ have units that would make p in kg·m/s. So, h is J·s, which is kg·m²/s, and λ is meters, so h / λ is kg·m/s, which is momentum. So, that works.

But if you have Boltzmann's constant, which is J/K, so to get units of momentum, you would need to multiply or divide by temperature or something else. So, it's not clear how k_B would be involved in p = something with λ.

Alternatively, if the question was about frequency, ω = p / m, but that still doesn't bring in k_B. I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is inverting the relationship. So, if we have p = h / λ, then h = p λ. So, h is Planck's constant, not k_B. So, again, h is the constant relating them.

Alternatively, if you have some other relation where, for example, in terms of angular momentum or something, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is referring to the relationship in the context of wave-particle duality, where the momentum is related to the wavelength. But again, that's Planck's constant.

Wait, could it be that the question is referring to the Compton wavelength? Which is h / (m c), so involving speed of light. But that's another constant, and the answer given is Boltzmann's, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up different constants. Or maybe the question itself is wrong.

Wait, the original question is: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants? A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light."

So, if the answer is B, then the question must be assuming that the constant is k_B. But why?

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the de Broglie wavelength in the context of blackbody radiation or something, where thermal wavelength is involved, which would involve k_B. But the question says free massive particle, which doesn't necessarily have to be thermal.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a specific source that defines the de Broglie wavelength in a particular way. For example, in some textbooks, they might define the de Broglie wavelength as λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T), which would involve k_B, but again, that's thermal.

But without that context, I don't see why the de Broglie relation would be with Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, because Planck's constant is the correct answer, and perhaps the given answer is wrong.

Wait, but since the user says the correct answer is B, maybe they have a different reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between momentum and period or frequency, but involving another constant.

Wait, if we have p = h / λ, and λ = c / f, so p = h f / c. So, p = (h / c) f, so the constant is h / c, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if we have angular momentum L = h / (2π) for circular motion, but again, not relevant here.

Alternatively, could it be about the relation between momentum and wavelength via the Compton wavelength? The Compton wavelength is λ = h / (m c), but again, that's speed of light.

Wait, but the Compton wavelength is related to the momentum p = h / λ, so λ = h / p. Hmm, but that still uses h, not k_B.

Wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me go back.

De Broglie's equation: p = h / λ, so the relationship is directly with Planck's constant. So, the correct answer should be A.

But the answer given is B. So, maybe the question is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing de Broglie wavelength with thermal wavelength, which does involve k_B.

Wait, in thermal physics, the thermal wavelength is given by λ = h / sqrt(2π m k_B T), so it does involve k_B, but again, that's a specific context.

But the question is about a free massive particle, which isn't necessarily in thermal equilibrium. So, without context, the general de Broglie relation is p = h / λ.

Alternatively, maybe it's a translation issue. If the question was in another language, maybe it was mistranslated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect or an old question where the answer was wrongly given.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in the context of the wavefunction, where the momentum is related to the wavelength via the Compton wavelength, but that still doesn't bring in k_B.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is referring to energy levels, where the energy is proportional to h divided by wavelength, but that's more about the Bohr model, which would involve Rydberg’s constant.

Wait, in the Bohr model, energy levels are given by E_n = - (m e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * (1/n^2), but that's again Planck's constant.

Alternatively, for hydrogen, the Rydberg constant is involved in the energy levels, but the question is about momentum and wavelength.

Wait, so maybe the question is referring to the relation between energy and wavelength via Rydberg's constant, but in that case, the relation would be E = hc / λ, which is again Planck's constant.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. So, if the answer given is B, maybe the person answering it is wrong, or maybe the question is specifically referring to something else.

Wait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the question was about the relation between energy and momentum, and the confusion is arising there.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but that's about position and momentum, not wavelength.

Wait, another angle: the de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / p, so if the question is saying "linear momentum and wavelength are related by a constant," then the constant is h. So, the answer is A.

Thus, if the answer is B, that seems incorrect. Unless the question is specifically referring to a different relation where k_B is involved, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a different source or in a different context where another constant is used, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me think about the constants. Planck’s constant is J·s, Boltzmann's is J/K, Rydberg’s is 1/m, speed of light is m/s.

So, if we have p = h / λ, h is in J·s, λ in m, so p is kg·m/s. So, h is the correct constant.

If we consider other constants, like the speed of light, which is m/s, but h / c is J·m/(kg·m), which is J/(kg·m), which doesn't directly give momentum.

Alternatively, if you have a relation involving c and h, but that's not the standard de Broglie relation.

Alternatively, if you have something like E = h c / λ, that relates energy, wavelength, and Planck's constant, but again, not momentum.

Wait, so maybe the question is incorrect. If the answer is B, then either the question is wrong or the options are mislabeled.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relation between the momentum and the period or frequency, but that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, if we have something like the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the thermal wavelength, which involves both h and k_B, but that's a different concept.

Wait, hold on. Maybe the person answering thought that the momentum is related to the thermal wavelength, which involves k_B, but no, the question specifies a free massive particle, not in thermal motion.

Alternatively, maybe in the context of wave packets, the spread of momentum and wavelength, but that's more about uncertainty principle and Fourier transforms, not a direct relation.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula of de Broglie wavelength. Yes, the de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / p, so the constant is Planck’s constant. Therefore, the answer should be A.

But the user says the correct answer is B, Boltzmann’s constant. So, is there a misunderstanding here?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between thermal de Broglie wavelength and momentum, which would involve k_B. But again, the question is about a free massive particle, not thermal.

Wait, unless the question is referring to particles in a gas, where the average momentum is related to temperature via k_B, but that still doesn't directly relate to the particle's own de Broglie wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of particle statistics, like Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac, but again, that's more about occupancy and doesn't directly relate to the de Broglie relation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relation between energy and wavelength, as in photons, where E = h c / λ, but again, that's Planck's constant.

Wait, but in that case, E = h c / λ, so h is the constant.

Alternatively, if the question is about the relation between the particle's kinetic energy and its wavelength, then KE = p²/(2m) = (h²)/(2m λ²). Here, h is Planck's constant again.

Alternatively, if it's about the Compton wavelength, which is λ = h / (m c), so h is involved, but that's a different concept.

Wait, unless it's about the relation between the particle's mass, momentum, and wavelength in a different system of units, but I don't think that would involve Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe in some other form of the equation, but I can't think of a scenario where Boltzmann's constant would directly relate momentum and wavelength.

Wait, unless the question is actually talking about the relation between energy and wavelength through the Rydberg constant. But energy is also related to momentum via E = p²/(2m). So, if we have E = hc / λ and E = p²/(2m), then combining them gives p = sqrt(2 m h c / λ). So, p is proportional to sqrt(h c / λ). But in this case, the constant would involve h, c, and m, but since m is a variable (mass of the particle), it's not a constant.

But again, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light, and m is mass.

Wait, but if the question is only about a constant, then the constant is h. But the question says "related by which of the following constants," so it's about the constant, not a combination. So, h is a constant, k_B is another, Rydberg is another, speed of light is another.

So, unless it's specifically about the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which involves k_B, but again, the question isn't about thermal.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the question is about the relation between the particle's momentum and its de Broglie wavelength in terms of frequency. So, if frequency f is related to wavelength λ by λ = c / f, and momentum p = h f / c, so p = h / λ, same thing.

Wait, let's think about units. If p = h / λ, and h is in J·s, and λ is in m, then p is in kg·m/s, which is correct. So, it's
[overthinking]
Alright, so I came across this multiple-choice question about Louis De Broglie's hypothesis. The question states: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, and D. The speed of light. The correct answer is supposedly B. Boltzmann’s constant, but I need to figure out why that is the case.

First, I remember that De Broglie's hypothesis is about the relationship between the momentum of a particle and its wavelength. So, I should recall the equation he proposed. I think it's something like p = h / λ, where p is momentum, h is Planck's constant, and λ is the wavelength. Let me check that... Yeah, that's right. De Broglie's equation relates linear momentum to wavelength using Planck's constant. So, the momentum (p) is equal to Planck's constant (h) divided by the wavelength (λ).

Wait, but the question is asking which constant is used in this relationship. So, from the equation, it's Planck's constant. So, the answer should be A. Planck’s constant. Hmm, but the given correct answer is B. Boltzmann’s constant. That's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Let me read the question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So, it's not about the formula, but about the constant used in the relationship. So, the relationship is p = h / λ, which uses Planck's constant. So, A should be the correct answer, not B.

But according to the user, the correct answer is B. So, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think. Is there another equation where Boltzmann's constant comes into play regarding momentum and wavelength?

I recall that Boltzmann's constant is related to the thermal energy of particles, specifically k_B = (1/38) * 10^-23 J/K, which is a small constant used in statistical mechanics. How does that relate to momentum and wavelength?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to another form of the relationship where Boltzmann's constant is involved. Wait, perhaps in the context of quantum mechanics and statistical physics, there might be another formula. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: sometimes constants are confused in different formulas. So, the momentum is related to wavelength by p = h / λ, but sometimes in different units or derivations, other constants might pop up. But I can't recall a direct relationship between momentum and wavelength involving Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a thermodynamic relation where momentum plays a role, but I don't think so. De Broglie's hypothesis is purely a quantum mechanical concept. It doesn't directly relate to thermodynamics, which would involve Boltzmann's constant.

Hold on, I should also consider if the question is perhaps misworded or if I'm misinterpreting it. Maybe it's not about the relationship between momentum and wavelength, but between something else. Wait, the question clearly says "linear momentum and wavelength," so that doesn't seem to be the issue.

Alternatively, could it be that the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which is λ = h / (m c), where c is the speed of light? But that's a different wavelength concept. The Compton wavelength is the wavelength of a particle with momentum p = m c, so λ = h / (m c). But in that case, the speed of light (option D) would be involved, not Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, maybe I should recall the derivation of De Broglie's hypothesis. I think it's derived from the wave equation for a particle, where the wavelength is related to the momentum through the relation E = p c, where E is energy and c is the speed of light. But in De Broglie's case, he related momentum to wavelength using Planck's constant because of the quantized nature of the wave.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of the equations again. De Broglie's equation is p = h / λ. So, the constant is Planck's constant, which is option A. So, why is the correct answer given as B, Boltzmann's constant? That doesn't make sense unless the question is incorrectly stated or I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that sometimes in problems, Planck's constant is expressed in terms of other constants. For example, Planck's constant is h = k_B * T, but that's only in certain contexts, such as when dealing with blackbody radiation or Bose-Einstein condensates. But that wouldn't be the case here because De Broglie's relation is a separate concept.

Alternatively, could the question be in another language or context where the translation is off? If it's translated from another language, maybe "momentum" refers to something else? But no, momentum is a standard term.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, in problems involving wave-particle duality, you have the momentum being related to the wavelength, but sometimes in problems with standing waves or interference, you might have other constants. For instance, in the case of standing waves in a box, you might relate momentum to wavelength using the quantized energy levels, which could involve Planck's constant and sometimes Boltzmann's constant in statistical mechanics. But that seems like a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in a different form, such as in the context of energy. For example, E = pc, where p is momentum and c is speed of light, and E also can be written in terms of wavelength and frequency: E = hc / λ. So, combining these, p c = hc / λ, which simplifies to p = h / λ, same as before. So, again, Planck's constant is involved.

Wait, but if we take that equation p c = hc / λ, and rearrange it, we get p = h / λ, so again, Planck's constant is the key. So, why would Boltzmann's constant be correct?

Wait, unless the question is asking about the relationship between momentum and wavelength in terms of units or something else. But no, the question clearly states the relationship by which constant, meaning the constant used in the equation.

Let me think if there's a version of De Broglie's equation that uses Boltzmann's constant instead of Planck's. I can't recall any such equation. Boltzmann's constant is a very small constant used in statistical mechanics, dealing with thermal energies and distributions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is misworded and actually refers to the relation between the momentum and the mass or something else involving Boltzmann's constant. But that doesn't make sense because momentum is mass times velocity, and Boltzmann's constant is a constant for thermal units.

Alternatively, maybe in some derivations, other constants are introduced, but I can't think of a direct link.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because sometimes in quantum mechanics, we use different forms. For example, the momentum is also related to the Compton wavelength, which is λ = h / (m c), but that's again Planck's constant.

Wait, hold on, let me think about the units. Planck's constant has units of J·s, which is kg·m²/s. Momentum has units of kg·m/s. So, if you have p = h / λ, the units would be kg·m/s = (kg·m²/s) / m, which works out.

Boltzmann's constant, on the other hand, has units of J/K, which is (kg·m²/s²)/K. That doesn't match the units of momentum or wavelength. Wavelength is in meters, so unless you have some additional constants, it doesn't make sense to relate momentum (kg·m/s) with Boltzmann's constant (kg·m²/s²/K) unless you have some temperature involved, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

So, that further solidifies that Planck's constant is the correct constant, not Boltzmann's.

Wait, maybe I should check the original sources or De Broglie's work to see if he used Boltzmann's constant. De Broglie's paper was in 1923, so let me think about that context. At that time, quantum mechanics was still in its early stages, and De Broglie was proposing the wave-particle duality. He used Planck's constant in his equation, so I don't think Boltzmann's constant would have come into play.

Unless, perhaps, the question is confusing another concept. For example, in the context of photon energy, E = h f, where f is frequency, but again, that relates to Planck's constant, not Boltzmann's.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relation between momentum and the thermal wavelength? The thermal wavelength is a concept in statistical mechanics where the wavelength associated with a particle's thermal de Broglie wavelength is given by λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So, in that case, the thermal wavelength involves Boltzmann's constant.

But wait, that's in the context of thermal physics, not De Broglie's original hypothesis. De Broglie's hypothesis was about the wave nature of matter, not specifically about thermal properties.

So, if the question is misapplying the concept by mixing De Broglie's hypothesis with thermal wavelengths, then perhaps it's referring to the thermal wavelength formula, which includes Boltzmann's constant. So, in that case, λ = h / (sqrt(2 π m k_B T)), which would mean that the wavelength is inversely proportional to Boltzmann's constant.

But in that case, the relationship is between wavelength and momentum because momentum is related to mass and temperature. So, is the question referring to that scenario?

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up two different concepts: the standard De Broglie relation and the thermal wavelength concept. But that would be a misunderstanding.

Wait, let me try to approach this from another angle. The question says De Broglie hypothesized that linear momentum and wavelength are related by which constant. So, the key is that it's a relationship between two variables: momentum and wavelength. The equation is p = h / λ, so the constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A.

But the user says the correct answer is B, Boltzmann's constant. So, perhaps the question is incorrect or the user is mistaken. Alternatively, there might be a miscommunication in the terminology.

Wait, could it be that the question is referring to angular momentum instead of linear momentum? But angular momentum involves different constants like ħ (the reduced Planck's constant), but that's still Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if it's angular momentum and wavelength, but that still doesn't make sense because angular momentum is related to torque and angular displacement, not directly to wavelength.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in wave equations, the dispersion relation is ω = c |k|, where ω is angular frequency, c is the speed of light, and k is the wave number. Since wave number k is 2π/λ, we have ω = c (2π/λ). But momentum p is related to k by p = ħ k, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h / 2π). So, combining these, p = ħ (2π/λ) * c = (h c)/(λ). So, p = (h c)/λ. So, in this case, the constant is h c, which is Planck's constant times the speed of light. But that's a product of two constants, Planck and speed of light.

But in the original De Broglie equation, it's just p = h / λ. So, unless the problem is considering relativistic momentum, but that still uses Planck's constant.

Wait, now I'm getting into more confusion. Let me try to clarify:

De Broglie's original hypothesis is p = h / λ, where h is Planck's constant.

In a more advanced context, especially relativistic, the energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², and the Compton wavelength is λ = h / (m c). So, Compton wavelength uses Planck's constant divided by the product of mass and speed of light.

But in neither case does Boltzmann's constant come into play. So, perhaps the question is incorrect in stating that the correct answer is B. Alternatively, the user may have made a mistake in identifying the correct answer.

Wait, unless the question is actually referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in a different context, like in the context of electrons in a metal or something else. But even then, the primary relation is p = h / λ, using Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if we are considering the de Broglie wavelength in the context of quantum mechanics and wave packets, the spread of a wave packet is related to Planck's constant. But that still doesn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the thermal wavelength, which involves Boltzmann's constant. But that would be incorrect because they are two different concepts.

In the thermal wavelength, as I mentioned earlier, λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T), which does involve Boltzmann's constant. So, if someone confuses the thermal wavelength with the de Broglie wavelength, they might think it's related to Boltzmann's constant.

But that would be a misapplication of the concepts. The de Broglie wavelength is h / p, and the thermal wavelength involves k_B. So, if the question is incorrectly referring to thermal wavelength as de Broglie wavelength, then it's wrong.

So, perhaps the confusion arises from conflating these two concepts, leading someone to think that Boltzmann's constant is the correct answer. However, in reality, the standard de Broglie relation uses Planck's constant.

Therefore, I think there might be a mistake in the question or the answer provided. The correct constant should be Planck's constant, which is option A. Unless there's additional context or a specific scenario where Boltzmann's constant is used, but I can't think of one related to De Broglie's hypothesis.

Wait, another angle: sometimes in particle physics, constants are expressed in terms of each other. For example, in units where ħ = c = 1, but that doesn't change the fundamental constant involved in the equation.

Alternatively, if we are working in natural units where ħ = k_B, but that's a units choice, not a fundamental relation.

So, unless the problem is using a non-standard form where h = k_B * something, but I don't recall such a relation.

Wait, maybe the confusion is in the symbol: sometimes h is confused with ħ, but no, that wouldn't bring in Boltzmann's constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in a different way, such as in the context of the Schrödinger equation, but again, that would still involve Planck's constant.

Wait, here's another thought: in the context of wave packets and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the spread of a particle's position and momentum is related by Planck's constant. Specifically, Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. But that's about uncertainty, not directly relating momentum and wavelength.

Alternatively, in quantum mechanics, the momentum operator is related to the derivative of the wavefunction, and the wave number k is related to momentum by p = ħ k, which again involves Planck's constant.

So, after going through all these possibilities, I can't see a scenario where Boltzmann's constant is the correct answer for this question. It seems like a misstatement or a confusion with another concept.

Therefore, I think the correct answer should be A. Planck’s constant. If the user says the answer is B, Boltzmann’s constant, that might be incorrect. However, if the question is referring to a specific non-standard context where Boltzmann's constant is involved, perhaps in a thermodynamic system where momentum and wavelength have some relation through temperature, but I don't know of such a connection.

Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a typo or misunderstanding, and it's supposed to refer to another concept involving Planck's constant but got mixed up with Boltzmann's.

In conclusion, based on De Broglie's original hypothesis, the correct constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A, not B. Unless there's additional context not provided, I can't see why Boltzmann's constant would be the correct answer.

But since the user says the correct answer is B, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think once more: De Broglie's hypothesis was p = h / λ, so h is Planck's constant. So, the relationship is via Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Wait, unless the question is referring to the relation in terms of angular momentum, but no, angular momentum is different. Or maybe it's a translation issue if the question was translated from another language. For example, "momentum" in another language might be a term that refers to something else, but I can't think of a language where that would be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a different context, like in the context of relativistic particles, but even then, the relation is still p = h / λ, just with relativistic mass or something else. But again, no involvement of Boltzmann's constant.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the user is mistaken in claiming the correct answer is B. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant Planck's constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relation between the Compton wavelength and momentum, where Compton wavelength is λ = h / (m c). So, if we rearrange that, p = m c, but that's just rest mass energy, which is different.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the relation between the de Broglie wavelength and the Compton wavelength, but that's a different concept.

Alternatively, perhaps in some notes or derivations, someone incorrectly substitutes Planck's constant with Boltzmann's, but that would be a mistake.

So, after all this thinking, I can't reconcile how Boltzmann's constant would be the correct answer. It doesn't fit into the equation, the units don't match, and De Broglie's hypothesis clearly uses Planck's constant. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is A. Planck’s constant, and the user might have been mistaken in saying the answer is B
