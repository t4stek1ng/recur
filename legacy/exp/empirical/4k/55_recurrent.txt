[recurrent thinking]
Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the photon when it collides with an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The setup is that the photon is destroyed, and both the positron and the two electrons move off at equal speeds in the original direction of the photon. The options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc², and the correct answer is given as B, 2mc². I need to understand why.

Okay, let me start by recalling some basic concepts. A photon is a particle of light, so it has energy but no rest mass, right? Its energy is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The electron, on the other hand, has mass m and a rest energy of mc².

When a photon collides with an electron that's initially at rest, the photon's energy is transferred to the electron, but in this case, instead of just the electron being excited or something, it actually creates a positron-positron pair. So the photon is absorbed, leading to the production of two electrons and a positron. All three particles move off with the same speed in the original direction of the photon.

So, energy and momentum must be conserved here. Let's think about that.

First, the initial energy is the photon's energy plus the electron's rest energy. That is, E_initial = E_photon + mc².

After the collision, we have three particles: two electrons and one positron. Each of these has rest mass m, so their rest energies are mc² each, totaling 3mc². But since they're moving, their kinetic energies must also be considered. However, the problem states that they all move at equal speeds. Let me denote their speed as v.

So, the total energy after the collision is the sum of their rest energies and their kinetic energies. The rest energy is 3mc², and the kinetic energy for each particle is (1/2)mv², but since they are moving relativistically, we have to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is E_k = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, the total energy after the collision is:

E_after = 3mc² + 3*(γ - 1)mc² = 3γ mc²

Similarly, the total momentum after the collision is the sum of the momenta of the three particles. Each particle's momentum is given by relativistic momentum, p = γmv. So, the total momentum after the collision is 3γmv.

But the photon's momentum before the collision is p_photon = E_photon / c. However, since the photon is destroyed, its momentum is also accounted for in the resulting particles' momenta.

So, applying the conservation of momentum:

p_initial = p_photon = E_photon / c = p_after = 3γmv

So now we have two equations:

1. E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc²
2. E_photon / c = 3γmv

Okay, so we have two equations with two unknowns, E_photon and γ. Let me write them more clearly:

Equation 1: E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc²

Equation 2: E_photon = 3γmv c

So, substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1:

3γmv c = 3γ mc² - mc²

Let me write that again:

3γmv c = 3γ mc² - mc²

We can factor out 3γ m c² on the right:

3γmv c = 3γ m c² - mc²

Let me rearrange this:

3γmv c = mc²(3γ - 1)

Divide both sides by m:

3γv c = c²(3γ - 1)

Divide both sides by c:

3γv = c(3γ - 1)

So,

3γv = 3γ c - c

Let me bring all terms to one side:

3γv - 3γ c + c = 0

Factor out γ from the first two terms:

γ(3v - 3c) + c = 0

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe let's solve for v in terms of γ.

From the above equation:

3γv = 3γ c - c

Divide both sides by 3γ:

v = c - (c)/(3γ)

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should express v in terms of γ and substitute back.

Wait, perhaps instead, let's solve for γ from Equation 2. From Equation 2:

E_photon = 3γmv c

And from Equation 1:

E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc²

Set them equal:

3γmv c = 3γ mc² - mc²

Let me write this as:

3γmv c = mc²(3γ - 1)

Divide both sides by m:

3γv c = c²(3γ - 1)

Divide both sides by c:

3γv = c(3γ - 1)

So,

3γv = 3γ c - c

Bring the 3γ v term to the right:

0 = 3γ c - c - 3γ v

Factor 3γ:

0 = 3γ (c - v) - c

So,

3γ (c - v) = c

Let me solve for γ:

γ = c / [3(c - v)]

Hmm, that's an expression for γ in terms of v.

But I also know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = c / [3(c - v)]

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1 / (1 - v²/c²) = c² / [9(c - v)^2]

Cross-multiplying:

9(c - v)^2 = c²(1 - v²/c²)

Expand the left side:

9(c² - 2cv + v²) = c² - v²

So,

9c² - 18cv + 9v² = c² - v²

Bring all terms to one side:

9c² - 18cv + 9v² - c² + v² = 0

Simplify:

8c² - 18cv + 10v² = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of v. Let me write it as:

10v² - 18c v + 8c² = 0

Hmm, let me try to solve for v.

Quadratic equation: av² + bv + c = 0

Here, a = 10, b = -18c, c = 8c²

Wait, but the variable is v, and the coefficients are in terms of c. Let me write it as:

10v² - 18c v + 8c² = 0

Let me divide all terms by c² to make it dimensionless:

10(v/c)² - 18(v/c) + 8 = 0

Let me set x = v/c, so equation becomes:

10x² - 18x + 8 = 0

Now, solving for x:

x = [18 ± sqrt(324 - 320)] / 20

Because the quadratic formula is x = [18 ± sqrt(18² - 4*10*8)] / (2*10) = [18 ± sqrt(324 - 320)] / 20 = [18 ± sqrt(4)] / 20 = [18 ± 2]/20

So,

x = (18 + 2)/20 = 20/20 = 1 or x = (18 - 2)/20 = 16/20 = 4/5

But x = v/c. If x = 1, then v = c, which is the speed of light. But photons move at speed c, and if the other particles are moving at speed c, that would be impossible because nothing exceeds the speed of light. Therefore, x = 1 is invalid in this context.

So, x = 4/5, which means:

v = (4/5)c

So, velocity is 4/5 of the speed of light.

Now, knowing that v = (4/5)c, let's find γ.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (16/25)) = 1 / sqrt(9/25) = 1 / (3/5) = 5/3

So, γ = 5/3.

Now, going back to Equation 2:

E_photon = 3γmv c

Which is:

E_photon = 3*(5/3)*m*(4c/5)*c

Simplify:

E_photon = 3*(5/3)*(4c²/5)*m

The 3 and 5/3 cancel out:

E_photon = (5/3)*(4c²/5)*m

Simplify 5 and 5 cancel:

E_photon = (1/3)*(4c²)*m = (4/3)mc²

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc².

Hmm, I got 4/3 mc², which is not an option. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Starting from the conservation equations:

E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc²
E_photon = 3γmv c

So, setting them equal:

3γmv c = 3γ mc² - mc²

Dividing both sides by m:

3γ v c = 3γ c² - c

Divide both sides by c:

3γ v = 3γ c - 1

So,

3γ (v - c) = -1

Therefore,

γ = -1 / [3(v - c)]

But since γ is positive (as it's a Lorentz factor), the negative sign indicates something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity or the momentum.

Wait, in the initial state, the photon is moving to the right, and the electron is at rest. After the collision, all three particles move to the right. So, their velocities are in the same direction as the photon.

Hmm, but in the frame of the center of momentum, which is moving at some velocity, but in reality, they all move in the same direction. So, in the rest frame of the electron before collision, the photon is moving towards it with some energy, and after collision, all particles move in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the momentum. Let me think again about the momentum.

The photon's momentum is E_photon / c, and that must equal the total momentum after collision, which is 3γmv.

So,

E_photon / c = 3γ m v

So, E_photon = 3γ m v c

Similarly, the energy is conserved:

E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc²

So, E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc²

So, set them equal:

3γ m v c = 3γ mc² - mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3γ v c = 3γ c² - c

Divide both sides by c:

3γ v = 3γ c - 1

So,

3γ v - 3γ c = -1

Factor:

3γ (v - c) = -1

Therefore,

γ = -1 / [3(v - c)]

But since v < c, (v - c) is negative, so γ is positive.

Let me express v in terms of γ.

From the above equation,

3γ (v - c) = -1

So,

v = c - 1/(3γ)

Now, using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

v = c - 1/(3γ)
