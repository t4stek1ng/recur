Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of an observable yields 0 at a certain time t. The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by a matrix operator P, whose first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0).

Hmm, let me try to recall what I know about quantum mechanics and observables. I remember that when you have an observable, which is represented by a Hermitian matrix, you can measure its eigenvalues. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection operator onto the corresponding eigenstate.

Wait, so the observable P is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The given matrix P has the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Is this matrix Hermitian? For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose.

Looking at the first row, it's (0, 1/√2, 0). The second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). If I take the conjugate transpose, the first column becomes (0, 1/√2, 0), which matches the first row. The second column becomes (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), matching the second row, and the third column becomes (0, 1/√2, 0), which matches the third row. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good.

Now, to find the probability that the measurement of P yields 0, I need to find the projection operator onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The probability is then the trace of the density matrix rho multiplied by the projection operator onto that eigenspace.

Wait, let's recall the formula. The probability P(0) of measuring 0 is Tr(rho P_0), where rho is the state density matrix and P_0 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0.

So, first, let me write down the state vector, which is the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So the state is a column vector |psi> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a 3x3 matrix.

But perhaps instead of computing rho explicitly, I can use the fact that the probability is |<psi| P_0 |psi>|^2, where P_0 is the projection onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, first, I need to find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, to find the eigenvalues of P, let's compute the characteristic equation det(P - lambda I) = 0.

Let me write down P - lambda I:

[ -lambda       1/sqrt(2)       0       ]
[ 1/sqrt(2)   -lambda       1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0           1/sqrt(2)      -lambda    ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute it.

det(P - lambda I) = -lambda * [ (-lambda)(-lambda) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))(-lambda) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Simplify each term:

First term: -lambda * [ lambda^2 - (1/2) ]
Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-lambda)/sqrt(2) - 0 ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -lambda / sqrt(2) ) = (lambda)/2
Third term is zero.

So overall determinant is:

First term + Second term = -lambda (lambda^2 - 1/2) + lambda/2 = -lambda^3 + (lambda)/2 + lambda/2 = -lambda^3 + lambda.

Set determinant to zero:

- lambda^3 + lambda = 0
=> lambda (-lambda^2 + 1) = 0
So eigenvalues are lambda = 0 and lambda = ±1.

Great, so eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So now, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to lambda = 0.

Let me compute the eigenvectors for lambda = 0.

So solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0, which is P |v> = 0.

So matrix P is:

[ 0       1/sqrt(2)       0       ]
[ 1/sqrt(2)   0       1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0       1/sqrt(2)       0       ]

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2))v2 + 0*v3 = 0
(1/sqrt(2))v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2))v3 = 0
0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2))v2 + 0*v3 = 0

So first equation: (1/sqrt(2))v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
Third equation: same as the first, so v2 = 0
Second equation: (1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

So the eigenvectors are of the form v1 = s, v2 = 0, v3 = -s, where s is a scalar.

So the eigenspace for lambda=0 is two-dimensional, spanned by |1> = [1; 0; 0] and |3> = [0; 0; 1], but wait, wait. Wait, in the second component, v3 = -v1, so the eigenvectors are [s, 0, -s]^T. So any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but the third component is -s. So in vector form, it's [s; 0; -s], so yes, it's along the vector [1; 0; -1].

So the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional? Wait, no, in a 3x3 matrix, if lambda=0 is an eigenvalue, the eigenspace can be one-dimensional or more if there are more eigenvectors.

Wait, let's see: the system of equations from P|v>=0 is:

(1/sqrt(2))v2 = 0
(1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) = 0
(1/sqrt(2))v2 = 0

So the first and third equations give v2=0, and the second equation gives v1 + v3 = 0.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T, which is a one-dimensional eigenspace. So only one eigenvector.

Wait, so is the eigenspace for lambda=0 one-dimensional?

Yes, because the only free variable is v1, so only one eigenvector.

So the projection operator P_0 onto this eigenspace is:

|<u| where u is the eigenvector [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

So the projection operator P_0 is |u><u|, which is:

[ (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)), (1/sqrt(2))(0), (1/sqrt(2))(-1/sqrt(2)) ]
[ (0)(1/sqrt(2)), 0, (0)(-1/sqrt(2)) ]
[ (-1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)), (-1/sqrt(2))(0), (-1/sqrt(2))(-1/sqrt(2)) ]

Simplify each component:

First row:
(1/2, 0, -1/2)
Second row:
(0, 0, 0)
Third row:
(-1/2, 0, 1/2)

So P_0 is:

[ 1/2   0   -1/2 ]
[ 0     0     0    ]
[ -1/2  0    1/2 ]

Now, to compute the probability, which is |<psi| P_0 |psi>|^2.

Let me compute <psi| P_0 |psi>.

First, let me write down the state vector |psi> as a column vector: [-1; 2; 1].

Compute |psi> <psi|:

But wait, no. Wait, the projection is P_0 |psi>, then take the inner product with <psi|.

Wait, actually, the probability is <psi| P_0 |psi>.

So first, compute P_0 |psi>:

Multiply the matrix P_0 by |psi>:

First component: (1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + 0 -1/2 = -1

Second component: 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0

Third component: (-1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)(1) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

So P_0 |psi> is [-1; 0; 1].

Then, <psi| P_0 |psi> is the inner product of |psi> and P_0 |psi>.

So <psi| P_0 |psi> = (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Wait, 2? So the probability is |2|^2 = 4? That can't be, since probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that seems wrong. Hmm, let me check my steps.

First, P_0 |psi>:

First component: (1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1. That's correct.

Second component: all zero. Correct.

Third component: (-1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)(1) = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. Correct.

So P_0 |psi> is [-1; 0; 1]. Then, <psi| P_0 |psi> is (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So |2|^2 is 4, which is greater than 1. That can't be a probability.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my projection operator is not correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, the projection operator onto the eigenspace is |u><u|, but if the eigenspace is one-dimensional, yes, but let me confirm.

Wait, earlier, I thought the eigenspace for lambda=0 is one-dimensional, but let me re-examine.

From the equations P |v> = 0:

v2 = 0, and v1 = -v3.

So, yes, that's one equation with two variables (v1 and v3), but the equation is v1 = -v3, so eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the projection operator is indeed |u><u|, where u is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, so P_0 is correct as above.

Wait, perhaps the issue is the state |psi> is not normalized. Let me check.

The state vector |psi> is [-1; 2; 1]. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So |psi> is not normalized. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi| / 6.

Wait, but in my previous calculation, I didn't normalize |psi> when computing <psi| P_0 |psi>, so I actually computed 6 times the inner product, which is 2. Then, 2 divided by 6 would be 1/3, which is a valid probability.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

In quantum mechanics, the probability is Tr(rho P_0), where rho is the density matrix. Since rho is |psi><psi|, but |psi> is not normalized, so rho is |psi><psi| divided by the norm squared of |psi>.

So in my case, |psi> is [-1; 2; 1], so ||psi||^2 = 6, so rho = (1/6) |psi><psi|.

Therefore, Tr(rho P_0) = (1/6) Tr(|psi><psi| P_0) = (1/6) <psi| P_0 |psi>.

In my earlier calculation, <psi| P_0 |psi> was 2. So (1/6)*2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. But wait, the correct answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3). Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing P_0 |psi> or in defining P_0.

Wait, another way: Maybe the eigenvectors are different.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvalues.

Wait, earlier, we found the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. Correct.

Now, for eigenvalue 0, we found eigenvectors [1; 0; -1], normalized to [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)]. So P_0 should be |u><u|, as I have.

But let me check if |u> is indeed in the null space of P.

Compute P |u>:

First component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (1/2) + (-1/2) = 0
Third component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) = 0

So yes, P |u> = 0, correct.

Hmm, so P_0 is correct.

Wait, then why is <psi| P_0 |psi> equal to 2? Because |psi> is not normalized.

So if I use rho = (1/6)|psi><psi|, then the probability is (1/6)*2 = 1/3.

But according to the user, the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So something is wrong.

Wait, sqrt(2/3) squared is 2/3, which is greater than 1/3, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong observable.

Wait, the observable is given by matrix P. So the measurement operator is P, but the eigenvalues we found are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but to get the probability of 0, it's the projection onto the eigenstate of 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the projection operator.

Wait, let me think differently.

Another approach: The probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of |psi> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as we found, with basis |u> = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

So the projection of |psi> onto |u> is the inner product <u| psi>.

Compute that:

< u | psi > = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 - (1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the projection is -sqrt(2) |u>.

The norm squared is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2.

So the probability is 2 / norm(|psi|)^2, which is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Hmm, same result as before. So according to this, the probability is 1/3.

But the correct answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3). So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the observable. The observable is given by P, but maybe it's actually P with eigenvalues 0, 1, and 2? Wait, no, we computed the eigenvalues as 0, 1, -1.

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation of eigenvalues.

The determinant was -lambda^3 + lambda = 0, so eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, perhaps the observable is supposed to be diagonal or something else.

Wait, let me verify the matrix P again.

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0

Alright, so I have this problem here about quantum mechanics, which seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding the problem and then figure out what I need to do.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, I can write that as a vector |ψ>:

|ψ> = | -1 >  
| 2  >  
| 1  >

And it's a column matrix, so it's a 3x1 vector.

Next, there's an observable represented by a matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out to visualize it better:

P = [  
[0, 1/√2, 0],  
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],  
[0, 1/√2, 0]  
]

So, that's our observable matrix.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0 at time t. So, I need to find P|ψ> and then compute the probability of measuring 0, which would involve taking the inner product of the resulting vector with the corresponding eigenvector of P that corresponds to eigenvalue 0. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the result you get is one of the eigenvalues of the observable matrix P. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector |ψ>. So, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue, and then find the component of |ψ> in that eigenvector. The square of that component will give me the probability.

Since the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, identify which eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue 0, and then project |ψ> onto that eigenvector.

So, step 1: Find the eigenvalues of P.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ are the eigenvalues.

Let me write down matrix P - λI:

P - λI = [  
[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],  
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],  
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]  
]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix will give me the characteristic equation. Let me compute that.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. I think cofactor expansion might be easier here because some elements are zero.

Let me expand along the first row since there are two zeros which might simplify things.

det(P - λI) = (-λ) * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] - (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] + 0 * something.

Calculating each minor:

First minor: det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2.

Second minor: det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2.

So, putting it all together:

det(P - λI) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) + 0  
= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2)  
= -λ³ + λ.

So, the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0. Let's factor that:

-λ(λ² - 1) = 0  
Which gives λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Alright, that gives us three eigenvalues. Now, for each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvector.

Starting with λ = 0.

Finding eigenvectors for λ = 0:

We solve (P - 0I)|v> = 0, so P|v> = 0.

So, the matrix becomes P itself:

[0, 1/√2, 0]  
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]  
[0, 1/√2, 0]  

We need to find vectors |v> = [v1, v2, v3] such that P|v> = 0.

Let's write down the equations:

1. 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0  
2. (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0  
3. 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as equation 1, so v2 = 0.

So, from equations 1 and 3, we get v2 = 0, and from equation 2, v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvectors for λ = 0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1] = v1[1, 0, -1].

Thus, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1].

Now, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=1.

For λ=1, we need to solve (P - I)|v> = 0.

So, P - I is:

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]  
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]  
[ 0, 1/√2, -1 ]  

Again, let's write the equations:

1. (-1)v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0  
2. (1/√2)v1 + (-1)v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
3. 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + (-1)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0

From equation 1: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2)v2

From equation 3: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2)v2

So, let me let v2 = t (a parameter). Then, v1 = (1/√2)t and v3 = (1/√2)t.

So, the eigenvector is |v> = [ (1/√2)t, t, (1/√2)t ].

We can factor out t and (1/√2)t, so the eigenvector is t[1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

So, the eigenspace for λ=1 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1/√2, 1, 1/√2].

Similarly, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=-1.

For λ=-1, solve (P - (-I))|v> = P + I |v> = 0.

So, P + I is:

[1, 1/√2, 0]  
[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]  
[0, 1/√2, 1]  

Write the equations:

1. 1*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0  
2. (1/√2)v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
3. 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 1*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0

From equation 1: v1 = - (1/√2)v2  
From equation 3: v3 = - (1/√2)v2

Let me let v2 = t, then v1 = - (1/√2) t and v3 = - (1/√2) t.

So, the eigenvector is |v> = [ -1/√2 t, t, -1/√2 t ].

Factor out t: t[ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]

So, the eigenspace for λ=-1 is one-dimensional, spanned by [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ].

So, now we have all the eigenvectors:

- For λ=0: |φ0> = [1, 0, -1]
- For λ=1: |φ1> = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]
- For λ=-1: |φ-1> = [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2]

Now, the state |ψ> is [ -1; 2; 1 ], a 3x1 column vector.

We need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So, the measurement yields 0 only if the state |ψ> is in the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0, right? Because P|ψ> would be 0|ψ>, so the only way the measurement is 0 is if |ψ> is in the λ=0 eigenspace.

So, to find the probability, we need to project |ψ> onto |φ0> and find the square of the magnitude of that projection.

Let me recall that the projection of |ψ> onto |φ0> is given by:

<φ0|ψ> = φ0^† ψ

So, the inner product. Since |φ0> is [1, 0, -1], and |ψ> is [ -1; 2; 1 ], the inner product is:

1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 0 -1 = -2

But wait, inner product is a scalar, and probability is the square of its magnitude. So, | <φ0|ψ> |² = | -2 |² = 4.

But that can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1. Clearly, I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. That can't be the case. Maybe I confused something.

Wait, actually, the projection is | <φ0|ψ> |². But in quantum mechanics, the probability is the square of the amplitude, which is the modulus squared of the inner product.

But in this case, the eigenvector |φ0> is normalized, right? Because we didn't normalize it. So, I need to check if the eigenvectors are orthonormal.

Wait, the eigenvectors we found are not necessarily orthonormal. So, perhaps I need to normalize them first.

So, let me check the norm of |φ0>. Its components are [1, 0, -1], so the norm is sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized |φ0> is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2].

Similarly, let's check the norm of |φ1>. Its components are [1/√2, 1, 1/√2], so the norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, normalized, |φ1> is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] / sqrt(2) or wait, no, the norm is sqrt(2), so normalized vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] divided by sqrt(2), which gives [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]. Wait, actually, no.

Wait, the norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2). So, to make it a unit vector, divide by sqrt(2). So, |φ1_normalized> = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] / sqrt(2) = [1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2))] = [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2].

Wait, let's actually compute:

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2] divided by sqrt(2):

First component: (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) = 1/2  
Second component: 1/sqrt(2)  
Third component: (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/2

So, yes, normalized |φ1> is [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2].

Similarly, let's compute the norm of |φ-1>. Its components are [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2], so the norm is sqrt( ( (-1/√2)^2 ) + 1^2 + ( (-1/√2)^2 ) ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2). So, normalized, |φ-1> is [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2] / sqrt(2) = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2].

So, now, all eigenvectors are unit vectors.

Now, the projection of |ψ> onto |φ0> is <φ0_normalized|ψ>. Since |φ0_normalized> is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2].

Compute the inner product with |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So, <φ0_normalized|ψ> = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So, the amplitude is -√2. The probability is the square of the absolute value, so | -√2 |² = (√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, that's still 2, which is greater than 1. That can't be, since probabilities can't exceed 1. So, clearly, there's a problem here.

Wait, hold on, this suggests that either my eigenvectors are not correct or I made a mistake in normalization.

Wait, no, when I calculated the norm of |φ0> it was sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, normalized, it's [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]. Similarly, |ψ> is [-1, 2, 1], so the inner product is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

But the probability is the square of this, which is 2, which is impossible. Hmm.

Wait, that suggests that the component of |ψ> in the λ=0 eigenspace is sqrt(2), but that's impossible because in quantum mechanics, probabilities must be between 0 and 1. Therefore, either my eigenvectors are wrong or my projection computation is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvectors.

For λ=0, the eigenvectors satisfy P|v> = 0. So, equations:

(1) 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0  
(2) (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0  
(3) 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as (1), so v2=0.

So, v1 = -v3, v2=0. So, eigenvectors are of the form [t, 0, -t]. So, the eigenspace is all scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]. So, that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I need to think about the system differently. The observable is represented by P, which is a Hermitian matrix, so it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. So, perhaps I need to check if the eigenvectors I found are orthogonal.

Wait, let me test the inner product of |φ0> and |φ1>.

|φ0> normalized is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2], |φ1> normalized is [1/2,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I want to figure out the probability that a measurement of an observable yields zero at time t. Let me break down what I know and try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might stumble a bit, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem gives me the state of the system at time t as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think this is a qubit state, right? Since it's a three-level system, it might be a qutrit, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the observable is also a 3x3 matrix? Let me check the operator P given.

The operator P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Hmm, okay, so it's a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/√2 off-diagonal in the first and second rows, and similarly in the second and third rows. The first and third rows have 0s off-diagonal. So, it looks like it's a three-level system with some specific structure.

Now, I recall that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue of an observable is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector. Or, more generally, the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of the operator.

So, first things first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P. Once I have that, I can determine which eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability by projecting the state onto that eigenvector.

Let me write down the operator P:

P = |   0      1/√2   0    |
        | 1/√2    0     1/√2 |
        |   0      1/√2   0    |

Okay, so it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices are diagonalizable and have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That should make things easier.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, let's set up the matrix (P - λI):

[ -λ      1/√2      0    ]
[ 1/√2   -λ      1/√2 ]
[   0     1/√2    -λ    ]

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.

The determinant of (P - λI) is:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's better to write it out more formally. Let me use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion along the first row.

So, det(P - λI) = (-λ) * det [ (-λ  1/√2)
                               (1/√2 -λ) ]
                  - (1/√2) * det [ (1/√2  1/√2)
                                   (0     -λ) ]
                  + 0 * something.

Calculating each minor:

First minor: det [ (-λ  1/√2)
                   (1/√2 -λ) ]

= (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)
= λ² - (1/2)

Second minor: det [ (1/√2  1/√2)
                   (0     -λ) ]

= (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0)
= -λ / √2 - 0
= -λ / √2

Third minor is multiplied by zero, so we can ignore it.

Putting it all together:

det(P - λI) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ / √2)

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2)*(-λ / √2) = (1/√2)*(λ / √2) = (λ)/2

So, combining the two terms:

det(P - λI) = (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ

Factor out λ:

det(P - λI) = -λ(λ² - 1)

Set this equal to zero:

-λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Solutions are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Great, so now I know that the possible outcomes of the measurement are 0, 1, and -1. The question specifically asks for the probability of getting 0.

Now, to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and find the norm squared of that projection.

Let me first find the eigenvectors.

Starting with λ = 0:

We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so Pv = 0.

So,

0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

So, v1 = -v3.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors of the form [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvectors can be written as [a, 0, -a] where a is a scalar.

Thus, a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0 is [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, actually, since a can be any scalar, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T.

Okay, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, to find the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector, the probability is the squared norm of this projection.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Let me recall the formula for the projection of a vector |ψ> onto an eigenvector |φ>:

<φ|ψ> is the inner product, which is φ₁ψ₁ + φ₂ψ₂ + φ₃ψ₃.

Then, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|².

But wait, since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, we can just take the inner product and square it.

So, let's compute <φ|ψ>, where φ is [1, 0, -1]^T.

So, <φ|ψ> = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Then, the probability is |-2|² = 4.

Wait, that can't be right, because 4 is greater than 1, which isn't possible for a probability. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, hold on. The inner product gives a complex number, and its magnitude squared is a probability. But if I got -2, then the square is 4, which is 4/ (norm of φ squared) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is (|ψ⋅φ|²) / (|φ|²). So, maybe I need to normalize the eigenvector first.

Wait, hold on, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|², where |φ> is a normalized eigenvector. Since |φ> is given as [1, 0, -1]^T, let me compute its norm.

|φ|² = (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 0 +1 = 2.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T.

Therefore, the projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is |ψ⋅(φ/|φ|)|².

First, compute ψ⋅φ: [ -1, 2, 1 ] ⋅ [1, 0, -1 ] = (-1)(1) + 2(0) + 1(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Then, the normalized projection is (-2) / |φ|, which is (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Wait, but the probability is the square of the absolute value, so | -√2 |² = 2.

But 2 can't be a probability either because probabilities must be between 0 and 1. So, clearly, I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I've confused something about the operator. Let me check the operator again.

Wait, the operator is P, which is given. So, perhaps I should have used the operator P and found the projection in a different way? Or maybe I messed up the eigenvector.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I should have found the eigenstates correctly.

Wait, when λ=0:

We had (P)v = 0, so the equations are:

(1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

So, the eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1]^T, which can be written as v1[1, 0, -1]^T.

So, for v1 = 1, it's [1, 0, -1]^T, which is the same as before.

So, maybe my mistake is in the computation of the inner product.

Wait, the state vector is (-1, 2, 1)^T.

So, computing the inner product with [1, 0, -1]^T:

1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. So that's correct.

But since the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T, which has norm sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))[1, 0, -1]^T.

So, the projection is [ψ⋅φ] / |φ| = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). Then, the probability is | -sqrt(2) | squared, which is 2. But this is greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

So, clearly, I'm misunderstanding something here. Maybe the operator isn't supposed to be P, but perhaps I have to consider the observable differently? Or is the operator P actually the observable? Wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to the possible measurement outcomes.

So, P must be Hermitian. Looking at P, it is symmetric, so it is Hermitian. So, that's okay.

Wait, but maybe the issue is the state vector. The problem says the state is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Is that normalized? Let's check its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the state vector is not normalized. So, perhaps I need to normalize it first? That might resolve the problem.

Yes, that makes sense. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, but it's not normalized. So, the probability should be |<φ|ψ>|² divided by the norm of ψ squared.

So, let me compute that.

First, the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, the inner product <φ|ψ> is (-2)/sqrt(2) as before, but the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T, and the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2))[1, 0, -1]^T.

So, the inner product is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1) * (1/sqrt(2))*(1) + (1/sqrt(6))*2 * (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*1 * (1/sqrt(2))*(-1).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1)*(1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = -1 / sqrt(12)

Second term: 2*0 / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 0

Third term: 1*(-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = -1 / sqrt(12)

Adding them up: (-1 -1)/sqrt(12) = -2/sqrt(12) = -sqrt(12)/6 = - (2*sqrt(3))/6 = -sqrt(3)/3.

So, the inner product is -sqrt(3)/3.

Wait, so the absolute value squared is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = (3)/9 = 1/3.

Ah, so the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that's different from sqrt(2/3). So, what's going on?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in normalizing the inner product. Let me re-express this.

Let me clarify:

If |ψ> is the state vector, and |φ> is the eigenvector, then the probability is |<φ|ψ>|², but only if |φ> is normalized. If |φ> is not normalized, we have to normalize it first.

Wait, in this case, |φ> is already normalized because its norm squared is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so normalized as 1/sqrt(2). So, the projection is <ψ|φ> = (-2)/sqrt(2) as before. But since |ψ> is not normalized, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² / (|ψ|²).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state |ψ> is supposed to be normalized, i.e., <ψ|ψ> = 1. But in this case, <ψ|ψ> = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6, so it's not normalized. Therefore, to compute the probability, I need to normalize |ψ> first.

So, let me define |ψ> as (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T. Then, the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, the projection onto |φ> is <φ_normalized|ψ_normalized> which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Compute this inner product:

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))

= (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(12))

= (-1 -1)/sqrt(12) = -2/sqrt(12) = -sqrt(12)/6 = - (2*sqrt(3))/6 = - sqrt(3)/3.

Thus, the absolute value squared is (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3.

So, the probability is 1/3.

But the problem says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). Hmm, so now I'm confused because according to my calculation, I get 1/3.

Wait, did I make a mistake in computing the projection?

Let me check:

Compute <φ|ψ>:

φ = [1, 0, -1]^T, ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

So, φ ⋅ ψ = (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Then, |φ> has norm sqrt(1 + 0 +1 ) = sqrt(2), so normalized φ is (1/sqrt(2))φ.

So, the projection is (φ ⋅ ψ) / ||φ|| = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

But then, since ψ is not normalized, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no. Wait, I think I confused this earlier.

In quantum mechanics, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|², but both φ and ψ need to be normalized. So, if φ is already normalized, and ψ is not, then to compute the probability, we have to compute |<φ|ψ_normalized>|².

Since ψ is not normalized, we have to normalize it first. So ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6))ψ.

So, the inner product
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of a certain observable will yield 0 at a specific time t. The system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by a matrix operator P, which has specific elements in each row. The first row of P is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). The question also mentions that the correct answer is √(2/3), but I need to figure out how to get there.

Okay, let's start by recalling what I know about quantum mechanics and measurements. When you have a system in a state |ψ> and you measure an observable O, the probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue λ is given by the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ. In other words, P(ψ) = |⟨λ|P|ψ⟩|², where |λ⟩ is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ.

But wait, in this problem, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. So I need to consider P as the observable. That might be a bit confusing because usually, the observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, right? So I should check if P is Hermitian. Let me look at the elements of P.

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Is this matrix Hermitian? Let me check the transpose. The transpose of P would have the same elements, but the off-diagonal elements would be in the same positions. Since all the elements are real and symmetric, yes, P is Hermitian. So that's good.

Now, the system's state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So let me denote this as |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. I need to compute the probability that a measurement of P will yield 0.

So, to do this, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, identify which eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of |ψ> onto that eigenspace. The probability will be the norm squared of that projection.

Alternatively, since the observable is a Hermitian operator, another approach is to compute ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩, which gives the expected value of the observable. But wait, that's the expectation value, not directly the probability. So that might not be the way to go.

Wait, maybe I can find the eigenvectors of P. Since P is symmetric (as it's Hermitian and real), its eigenvectors are orthogonal and can be used to construct an orthonormal basis.

So, let's try to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Let me write down P again:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix P - λ I:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant is:

| -λ       1/√2      0  |
| 1/√2   -λ      1/√2 |
| 0      1/√2     -λ  |

Let me compute this determinant.

I can expand along the first row because there's a zero which might simplify things.

The determinant would be:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ 1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] ) + 0 * something.

So, computing the first term:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] = -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ]

Second term:

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] = - (1/√2) [ -λ/√2 ] = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ / 2

Third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ / 2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

Set determinant equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0

=> λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Alright, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So, 0 is one of the eigenvalues. So the observable P can yield 0, 1, or -1.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ = 0.

So, solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So, P |v> = 0.

That gives the system:

0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

So, the eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector with v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [1; 0; -1], or any scalar multiple of that.

Similarly, for λ=1:

We have (P - I)|v> = 0.

So, the matrix P - I is:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -1]

So, set up the equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0  --> equation (1)

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 --> equation (2)

(1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 --> equation (3)

From equation (3): (1/√2) v2 = v3 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

From equation (1): -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

So, let v2 = sqrt(2) (to make it integer for simplicity), then v1 = 1, v3 = 1.

So, the eigenvector is [1; sqrt(2); 1] or any scalar multiple.

But to make it a unit vector, we can normalize it.

Compute the norm: sqrt(1² + (sqrt(2))² + 1²) = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2.

So, the unit eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2)[1; sqrt(2); 1].

Similarly, for λ=-1:

We have (P - (-1)I) |v> = 0 => (P + I)|v> = 0.

Compute P + I:

[1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 1]

So, the system is:

v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 --> equation (1)

(1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 --> equation (2)

(1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0 --> equation (3)

From equation (3): v3 = - (1/√2)v2

From equation (1): v1 = - (1/√2)v2

From equation (2): (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)( -1/√2 v2 ) = 0

Compute each term:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = (-1/2)v2

v2 remains v2

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = (-1/2)v2

So, adding them up: (-1/2)v2 + v2 + (-1/2)v2 = (-1/2 + 1 - 1/2) v2 = 0*v2 = 0.

So, equation (2) is automatically satisfied given equations (1) and (3). So, we have v1 = - (1/√2)v2, v3 = - (1/√2)v2. So, let v2 = sqrt(2) for simplicity, then v1 = -1, v3 = -1.

Thus, the eigenvector is [-1; sqrt(2); -1], and we can normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2. So, the unit eigenvector is (-1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2).

Alright, so now I have the eigenvalues and their corresponding unit eigenvectors.

Eigenvalue λ=0: eigenvectors [1; 0; -1] normalized. Wait, actually, earlier I said the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], but when I normalized it, what was its norm? Let's check.

Original eigenvector for λ=0: [1; 0; -1]. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the unit eigenvector is (1/√2; 0; -1/√2).

Similarly, the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2) and (-1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2), respectively.

So, now, since the observable P is diagonal in this basis, the probability of measuring λ=0 is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of λ=0.

Since the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional (only one eigenvector), the projection is just the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector.

So, let me compute ⟨ψ| v_0 ⟩, where v_0 is the unit eigenvector for λ=0.

Compute the inner product:

⟨ψ| v_0 ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ] [ 1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ]^T

= (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2 - 1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (√2)^2 = 2. Wait, that can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that suggests I made an error here.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the inner product again.

Wait, no, actually, the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/√2; 0; -1/√2). So, the inner product with |ψ> is:

(-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -√2. So the squared norm is (√2)^2 = 2? That's impossible because probability can't be more than 1.

Wait, so maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the observable is represented by P, so when we have a measurement, the outcome is an eigenvalue of P, which can be 0, 1, or -1.

But how is the probability calculated?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the projection operator onto the eigenspace.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates are orthonormal, the probability is the sum over the squares of the overlaps.

But in this case, since λ=0 is a single eigenvector, the probability is just |⟨v0 | ψ⟩|².

But in my calculation, I got | -√2 |² = 2, which is greater than 1. That can't be. So, I must have messed up the eigenvector.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the eigenvector for λ=0 again.

From earlier: the eigenvector satisfies P |v> = 0.

So, P |v> = [0, 1/√2, 0; 1/√2, 0, 1/√2; 0, 1/√2, 0] [v1; v2; v3] = [0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3; (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3; 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3]

So, P |v> = [ (1/√2)v2; (1/√2)(v1 + v3); (1/√2)v2 ]

So, setting P |v> = 0:

(1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.

So, v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvector is [v1; 0; -v1].

So, to make it a unit vector, choose v1 such that v1² + 0 + (-v1)^2 = 1 => 2 v1² =1 => v1=1/√2, so the eigenvector is (1/√2; 0; -1/√2). So that part was correct.

So, the inner product ⟨ψ| v0 ⟩ is [ -1, 2, 1 ] [1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ].

Compute this:

(-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2 - 1/√2 ) = -2/√2 = -√2.

Then, the probability is | -√2 |² = 2. Hmm, that's indeed greater than 1. That can't be. So, what's wrong here?

Wait a minute, maybe I confused the observable. Is P the observable or is it some other operator?

Wait, the problem says "An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P". So, if P is Hermitian, then it's an observable. So, then the states are vectors in a Hilbert space, and the probability of measuring eigenvalue λ is |⟨ v_λ | ψ ⟩|², where |v_λ⟩ are the eigenvectors.

But getting a probability of 2 is impossible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the inner product.

ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ]

v0 = [1/√2; 0; -1/√2 ]

So, ⟨ψ|v0⟩ = (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

Yes, same as before. The square is (√2)^2 = 2.

Hmm, I must be missing something here.

Wait, is the observable correctly given? Let's double-check.

The first row is 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute the expectation value instead. Maybe that will give some insight.

Expectation value ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩.

Compute that.

So, first compute P |ψ>:

P |ψ> = [0, 1/√2, 0; 1/√2, 0, 1/√2; 0, 1/√2, 0] [ -1; 2; 1 ]

Compute each component:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(2) + 0*(1) = 2/√2 = √2

Second component: (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (1/√2)(1) = (-1 +1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(2) + 0*(1) = 2/√2 = √2

So, P |ψ> = [√2; 0; √2 ]

Now, ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ] [√2; 0; √
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem where the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). That means the state vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). 

Then, there's an observable represented by a matrix operator P. The first row of P has elements (0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0), the second row is (\(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\)), and the third row is (0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix. 

I need to calculate the probability that the measurement of this observable will yield 0 at time t. They mentioned the correct answer is \(\sqrt{2/3}\), but I need to figure out how to get there step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue is given by the square of the norm of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace of the observable. So, if I can find the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 for the observable P, then I can project the state vector onto that eigenspace and find the probability.

Wait, but hold on. P is the observable, so it's an operator. The eigenvalues of P correspond to the possible outcomes of the measurement. But in this case, let me confirm if 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expected value or use the Born rule directly. The Born rule states that the probability of an outcome is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude, which is the inner product of the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

But first, I might need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because if 0 is an eigenvalue, then any vector in its eigenspace will satisfy \(P \mathbf{v} = 0\). If 0 is not an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is zero.

So, let me check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation of P, which is det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix P:

- First row: [0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0]
- Second row: [\(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\)]
- Third row: [0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0]

So, P is a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices are diagonalizable and have real eigenvalues.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λI):

P - λI = [ [-λ, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), 0],
            [\(1/\sqrt{2}\), -λ, \(1/\sqrt{2}\)],
            [0, \(1/\sqrt{2}\), -λ] ]

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be computed using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me use the cofactor expansion along the first row.

det(P - λI) = -λ * det[ [-λ, \(1/\sqrt{2}\)],
                        [\(1/\sqrt{2}\), -λ] ]
                  - (1/√2) * det[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
                                   [0, -λ] ]
                  + 0 * something... So the last term is zero.

So, compute the first term:

First minor determinant: det[ [-λ, 1/√2],
                                [1/√2, -λ] ] = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2

Multiply by -λ: -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + λ/2

Second term: - (1/√2) * det[ [1/√2, 1/√2],
                               [0, -λ] ]

Compute the minor determinant: (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

Multiply by -1/√2: -1/√2 * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So, putting it all together:

det(P - λI) = (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Set determinant to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. So, the probability of measuring 0 is not zero.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ = 0. So, let's solve (P - 0I)v = 0, which is Pv = 0.

So, the matrix P is given, and we need to solve for v such that Pv = 0.

Let me write down the system of equations:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0
Equation 2: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0
Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0

So, equation 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3
Equation 3: same as equation 1: v2 = 0

So, the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = t, then v1 = -t. So, eigenvectors are t*(-1, 0, 1), t is any scalar. So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (-1, 0, 1).

Therefore, any vector in the eigenspace is a scalar multiple of (-1, 0, 1). So, the projection of the state vector onto this eigenspace will give the amplitude for the probability.

So, the state vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

I need to project this vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0, which is the span of (-1, 0, 1). Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the eigenvector.

Wait, actually, to find the projection, it's (state · eigenvector) / ||eigenvector||^2 * eigenvector.

But since we are only interested in the probability, which is the squared norm of the projection, it's |(state · eigenvector)|² / ||eigenvector||².

So, let's compute the inner product:

state · eigenvector = (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Then, the norm squared of the eigenvector is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

So, the probability is |2|² / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.

Wait, that gives 2, but the answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3). Hmm, I must have messed something up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the projection.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the projection is onto the eigenspace, which is a subspace. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the component of the state in that direction.

But the norm of the projection is |(state · eigenvector)| / ||eigenvector||, so the probability is (|state · eigenvector| / ||eigenvector||)^2.

Compute that:

(state · eigenvector) = 2

||eigenvector|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2)

So, |state · eigenvector| / ||eigenvector|| = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Then, probability is (sqrt(2))² = 2

Wait, again, that's 2. But the answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3).

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the eigenspace.

Wait, when I solved (P - 0I)v = 0, I got v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3, so eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (-1, 0, 1). But is that correct?

Wait, let me double-check:

From equation 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Equation 3: same as equation 1: v2 = 0

So yes, eigenvectors are indeed of the form (-t, 0, t), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

Wait, but if I compute the projection, that gives me a scalar, and the probability is the square of its absolute value.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the projection onto the eigenspace, which is a line. So, the projection operator is:

Projection matrix = (eigenvector)(eigenvector)^T / ||eigenvector||^2

So, the projection matrix is [ (-1)(-1) , (-1)(0), (-1)(1) ] / 2

Wait, that is [ (1), (0), (-1) ] / 2

So, the projection matrix is:

[ 1/2, 0, -1/2 ]

Then, applying this to the state vector:

[ 1/2*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)*1, 0, 0 ]

Wait, the projection is a vector. Let's compute it:

First component: (1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = -1

Second component: 0

Third component: 0

So, the projection vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\). Then, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, the probability is 1, but that's also not matching sqrt(2/3). Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to project onto the eigenspace differently.

Wait, the projection onto the eigenspace is not just the component in the direction of a single eigenvector if the eigenspace is one-dimensional because the entire eigenspace is that line. So, any vector in the eigenspace is a scalar multiple of that eigenvector. So, the projection is just that component.

But when I computed it, I got a vector of norm 1, which gives probability 1. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the projection.

Wait, the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace is equal to the component of the state vector in the direction of the eigenvector. So, it's (state · eigenvector / ||eigenvector||²) * eigenvector.

So, let's compute that.

First, the inner product: state · eigenvector = (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Then, ||eigenvector||² = (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2

So, the projection vector is (2 / 2) * eigenvector = 1 * eigenvector = (-1, 0, 1)

So, the projection vector is (-1, 0, 1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2

So, the probability is 2, as previously.

But the answer is sqrt(2/3). So, clearly, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the observable isn't P itself but something else. Wait, the problem says an observable is represented by the matrix operator P. So, P is the observable.

So, the possible measurements are the eigenvalues of P, which are 0, 1, and -1.

So, the probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0.

But if the projection is giving me a vector of norm sqrt(2), then the probability is (sqrt(2))² = 2. But that's larger than 1, which is impossible for probability. So, I must have messed up the projection.

Wait, hold on. The projection of the state onto the eigenspace is a vector, whose norm squared is the probability.

But in my calculation, the projection vector is (-1, 0, 1), whose norm squared is 2. Therefore, the probability is 2, which is greater than 1, which is impossible.

Wait, that must be wrong. So, I must have a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is not (-1, 0, 1). Let me re-examine the solution for Pv = 0.

We had:

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, yes, eigenvectors are [v1, 0, v3] with v1 = -v3, which is scalar multiples of (-1, 0, 1). So, that's correct.

Wait, but if the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector gives a vector of norm sqrt(2), which when squared is 2, that can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the definition.

Wait, perhaps the observable is not P itself, but something else. Wait, the problem says "an observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P". So, P is the observable. So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

So, the measurement outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

Thus, the probability for 0 is indeed the squared norm of the projection onto the eigenspace of 0, which we found to be 2, but that's more than 1, which is impossible.

Therefore, my mistake must be in the projection.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the operator is being represented as a density matrix? Or maybe P is not the operator but the probability matrix.

Wait, no. In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a Hermitian operator. In this case, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. So, the process is correct.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. So, perhaps I should think in terms of density matrices. The state is a pure state, given by |ψ>, which is the column vector. So, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|.

The probability of measuring a value λ is <ψ| P' |ψ>, where P' is the projection onto the eigenspace of λ.

Since λ=0, P' is the projection onto the eigenspace of 0, which is the span of (-1, 0, 1).

So, the projection matrix is |v><v|, where v is the eigenvector.

So, |v><v| = (1/2)( -1, 0, 1 ) ( -1, 0, 1 )^T.

Wait, so the projection operator is (1/2)( -1, 0, 1 ) ( -1, 0, 1 )^T.

Then, <ψ| P' |ψ> = (1/2) <ψ| v><v| ψ> = (1/2)( <ψ|v> )².

Compute <ψ|v> where ψ is (-1, 2, 1) and v is (-1, 0, 1):

<ψ|v> = (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, probability is (1/2)(2)^2 = (1/2)(4) = 2. Again, 2, which is impossible.

Wait, this is weird. The probability cannot be greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that 0 is an eigenvalue.

Wait, when I computed the determinant earlier, it was -λ³ + λ = 0, so λ(λ² - 1) = 0, so λ = 0, 1, -1. So, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue.

But wait, maybe the observable is defined differently. Sometimes, observables can be represented as P = OO†, where O is an operator. So, maybe P is not the Hermitian operator itself, but something else.

Wait, the problem says "an observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P". So, P is the observable, so it must be Hermitian. As we saw
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I want to figure out the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a matrix operator with specific elements. I need to calculate this probability, and it's supposed to be sqrt(2/3). Hmm, okay, let me walk through my thought process step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude corresponding to that eigenvalue. So, the probability P(0) is |<ψ|P|ψ>|², where ψ is the state vector. Wait, no, actually, more precisely, the observable P has eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the projection of the state onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. That is, P(0) = Tr(Pρ), where ρ is the density matrix of the state. But since the system is in a pure state, ρ is just |ψ><ψ|.

But maybe I can compute this by first finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable P, and then express the state ψ in terms of those eigenvectors. Then, the probability of measuring 0 would be the square of the coefficient corresponding to the eigenvector for 0.

So, the first thing I need is the matrix P. Let me write it down as given:

The first row of P is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

The third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

So, P is:

[  0      1/√2    0  ]

[1/√2    0     1/√2 ]

[  0      1/√2    0  ]

Okay, that's a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices are easier to diagonalize.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I can set up the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix P - λI:

[ -λ      1/√2      0    ]

[1/√2    -λ     1/√2 ]

[ 0      1/√2     -λ  ]

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be computed using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me expand along the first row.

So, det(P - λI) = (-λ) * det[ (-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ) ] - (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ) ] + 0 * det(...).

That simplifies to:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ].

Calculating each part step by step.

First term: (-λ) * [ (λ²) - (1/2) ] because (1/√2)(1/√2) = 1/2.

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (λ)/2.

So putting it together:

det(P - λI) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2.

Let me expand that:

= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on:

Wait, det(P - λI) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2

= -λ*(λ²) + (-λ)*(-1/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2

Wait, that seems to be:

-λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ.

Wait, that simplifies to -λ³ + λ.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculation.

Yes, the determinant is:

First, the first term from the expansion: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ].

Which is (-λ) * [ λ² - 1/2 ].

Then, the second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ].

Which is - (1/√2) * [ -λ/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/2.

So, the determinant is (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2.

Expanding the first term: (-λ)(λ²) + (-λ)(-1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2.

Then adding the second term: + (λ)/2.

So, total determinant is -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So, set det(P - λI) = 0:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor out λ:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, solutions are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Great, so the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1.

So now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the state ψ onto that eigenvector, take the absolute value squared.

So, first, let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

So, (P - 0I) v = 0, which is P v = 0.

So, writing P as:

[ 0      1/√2    0  ]

[1/√2    0     1/√2 ]

[ 0      1/√2    0  ]

Multiply by a vector v = [a; b; c], then P v = 0 gives:

First component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = 0 ⇒ (1/√2) b = 0 ⇒ b=0.

Second component: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)(a + c) = 0 ⇒ a + c = 0 ⇒ c = -a.

Third component: 0*a + (1/√2)*b + 0*c = 0, same as first component, which is already satisfied since b=0.

So, the eigenvector for λ=0 is in the form [a; 0; -a] = a[1; 0; -1].

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1; 0; -1].

Thus, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1; 0; -1].

So, the projection operator onto this eigenvector is |⟨v|ψ⟩|², where v is [1; 0; -1], and ψ is the state vector.

So, let's write ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1 ]

       [  2 ]

       [  1 ]

So, compute the inner product ⟨v|ψ⟩ = v† ψ.

v is [1; 0; -1], so v† is [1 0 -1].

So, v† ψ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Therefore, |⟨v|ψ⟩|² = | -2 |² = 4.

Wait, but that's not matching the expected answer, which is sqrt(2/3). Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the observable P.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, which P is, because it's symmetric, so that's good.

The probability of measuring 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.

But perhaps I misapplied something.

Wait, the projection operator onto the eigenvector v is |v><v|.

So, the probability is ⟨ψ| |v><v| ψ⟩ = |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But in my calculation, that gave me 4, which is 2 squared, but the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is not normalized? Wait, let me check.

The given state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute its norm:

||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So, the squared norm is 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state vector is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state should be a normalized vector. Hmm, maybe I should normalize it first.

Let me think: if the state vector is not normalized, the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², because the state is ψ = ||ψ|| * (normalized vector). So, perhaps I need to normalize it.

So, let me compute the norm squared of ψ: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is ψ_normalized = ψ / sqrt(6) = [ -1/sqrt(6) ; 2/sqrt(6) ; 1/sqrt(6) ].

So, then, ⟨v|ψ_normalized⟩ = [1 0 -1] * ψ_normalized = 1*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1)*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(6) = (-2)/sqrt(6).

So, the absolute value squared is (4)/(6) = 2/3. So, the probability is 2/3, but wait, that's 2/3, which is about 0.666... But the expected answer is sqrt(2/3), which is about 0.816...

Hmm, that's conflicting. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of the projection operator, which is equal to Tr(Pρ), where ρ = |ψ><ψ| / ||ψ||².

So, the projection operator onto the eigenvector v is |v><v|.

So, Tr(|v><v| ρ) = Tr(|v><v| |ψ><ψ| ) / ||ψ||².

But since |v><v| |ψ><ψ| is |v><ψ| ψ><ψ|, so the trace is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Which, as I calculated, is (4)/6 = 2/3.

Hmm, so this suggests the probability is 2/3, but the given answer is sqrt(2/3). I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the concept. Alternatively, maybe the observable is represented by P, but perhaps it's not the projection operator, but P itself. Wait, no, the observable is P, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. The probability of getting 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the 0 eigenstate. So, that's |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, so if I scale the state correctly, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the inner product.

v = [1; 0; -1]

ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ]

⟨v|ψ⟩ = 1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 -1 = -2.

||ψ||² = 6, so |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||² = (4)/6 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666...

That's the probability.

But the answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I misunderstood what the observable is.

Wait, another approach: maybe the observable is not P, but P is already diagonalized, so maybe P is diagonalized as P = V D V†, where D is diagonal with eigenvalues. Then, the projection onto the 0 eigenvector is |v><v|, where v is the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but in any case, the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², which is 2/3.

Wait, so why is the correct answer sqrt(2/3)? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe the state vector is already normalized? Let me check.

No, because the norm squared is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, the state vector is not normalized.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is represented by a different operator. Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, that's the state vector, which is ψ = [-1; 2; 1], which has norm sqrt(6), as we saw.

An observable is represented by the matrix operator P, which is given. So, the observable is P, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So, the probability of measuring 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, which is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², as ψ is not necessarily normalized.

Wait, but no, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to be normalized. So, maybe I should have normalized ψ first.

So, ψ_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6); 2/sqrt(6); 1/sqrt(6) ].

Then, the inner product ⟨v|ψ_normalized⟩ = [1 0 -1] * [ -1/sqrt(6); 2/sqrt(6); 1/sqrt(6) ].

Compute that: 1*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1)*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(6) = (-2)/sqrt(6).

The absolute squared is (4)/(6) = 2/3 ≈ 0.666...

So, again, the probability is 2/3, which is 0.666...

But the correct answer is sqrt(2/3), approximately 0.816... So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the observable with something else.

Wait, maybe P is not the observable itself, but an operator that is being measured. Wait, no, the observable is given by P, so it should be.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is represented as P, but in the problem statement, P is the operator, so the probability is indeed 2/3, so maybe the correct answer is sqrt(2/3) is wrong.

But the problem says "Why the correct answer is: sqrt(2/3)", so maybe I have a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is represented differently. Wait, perhaps the state vector is a row vector, not a column vector? Let me check.

Wait, no, the state is a column vector, as given by the column matrix. So, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the operator P is not symmetric? But the problem says it's a matrix operator with the given elements, which seems symmetric.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the eigenvalues. Let me double-check the determinant calculation.

Earlier, I computed det(P - λI) = -λ³ + λ = 0. So, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the observable is being measured in a different basis, and I need to express the state in that basis.

Wait, perhaps the observable P is not diagonal in the standard basis, so I should change the basis to diagonalize P.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. I found the eigenvectors, and the projection.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the expectation value differently.

Wait, the expectation value of P is ⟨ψ|P|ψ⟩. But that would give me the weighted average of the eigenvalues, but I think that's not what we want here.

Wait, let me compute that expectation value just to see:

⟨ψ|P|ψ⟩ = [ -1  2  1 ] * P * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Compute it:

First, compute P * ψ:

P is:

[  0      1/√2    0  ]

[1/√2    0     1/√2 ]

[  0      1/√2    0  ]

Multiply by ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

First row: 0*(-1) + 1/√2 * 2 + 0*1 = (2)/√2 = sqrt(2).

Second row: 1/√2*(-1) + 0*2 + 1/√2*
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem where the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by a matrix operator P. The first row of P has elements (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). I need to calculate the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t. The correct answer is supposed to be √(2/3), but I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (or outcome) of an observable is given by the square of the absolute value of the overlap between the state vector and the corresponding eigenstate. But wait, actually, more accurately, it's the square of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of the observable.

But before that, maybe I need to understand what exactly the observable P is. Since P is a matrix operator, it might represent an observable, and we can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the sum of the probabilities of projecting the state onto each corresponding eigenspace.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the Born rule, which says that the probability of an outcome is the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector of the observable, squared in absolute value.

Wait, but in this case, P is a Hermitian operator because observables must have real eigenvalues. So P is a real matrix here? Let me check the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Hmm, this is a symmetric matrix because the element (2,1) is equal to (1,2), and similarly (3,2) equals (2,3). So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

So to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenspace.

First, let me write down the state vector and the matrix P.

State vector |ψ> is a column vector:
|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

Matrix P is:
[ 0      1/√2    0   ]
[1/√2     0     1/√2 ]
[ 0     1/√2    0   ]

Now, to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, I need to solve the equation P |v> = 0 |v>, where |v> is the eigenvector.

So, let's set up the equation:

[ 0      1/√2    0   ] [v1]   [0]
[1/√2     0     1/√2 ] [v2] = [0]
[ 0     1/√2    0   ] [v3]   [0]

This gives us the system of equations:

1. 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0
2. (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0
3. 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as equation 1, so v2 = 0

So, from equations 1 and 3, we get v2 = 0. From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is of the form:

|v> = [v1]   [ -v3 ]
      [v2] = [  0  ]
      [v3] = [ v3  ]

But since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can write the eigenvector as:

|v> = a*[ -1, 0, 1 ]^T

Where a is a scalar.

So, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Now, the next step is to compute the projection of the state vector |ψ> onto this eigenspace.

The projection operator P_proj is given by:

P_proj = (|v><v|) / (|v|^2)

Where |v> is the eigenvector, so:

|v> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T

Compute |v><v|:

|v><v| = [ -1, 0, 1 ] [ -1, 0, 1 ] = [ ( (-1)(-1), (-1)(0), (-1)(1) ), (0)(-1), (0)(0), (0)(1) ), (1)(-1), (1)(0), (1)(1) ]

Wait, that seems messy. Let me compute it step by step.

First, |v> = [ -1, 0, 1 ].

So, |v><v| is:

[ (-1)(-1) , (-1)(0), (-1)(1) ]
[ (0)(-1), (0)(0), (0)(1) ]
[ (1)(-1), (1)(0), (1)(1) ]

Which results in:

[ 1, 0, -1 ]
[ 0, 0, 0  ]
[ -1, 0, 1 ]

Now, |v><v| is a rank-1 matrix since only the first and third rows are non-zero and they are the same.

The norm squared of |v> is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the projection operator P_proj is (1/2) times the matrix:

[ 1, 0, -1 ]
[ 0, 0, 0  ]
[ -1, 0, 1 ]

So, P_proj = (1/2) * |v><v|.

Now, the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace is:

|ψ_proj> = P_proj |ψ>

Let's compute |ψ_proj>:

|ψ> = [ -1 ]
       [  2 ]
       [  1 ]

So, multiply P_proj with |ψ>:

P_proj |ψ> = (1/2) * [1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1] * [ -1; 2; 1 ]

Let me compute each component:

First component:
(1/2) * [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ] = (1/2) * [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/2)*(-2) = -1

Second component:
(1/2) * [ (-1)*0 + 2*0 + 1*0 ] = (1/2)*0 = 0

Third component:
(1/2) * [ (-1)*(-1) + 2*0 + 1*1 ] = (1/2)*[1 + 0 +1] = (1/2)*2 = 1

So, |ψ_proj> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

Wait, that's interesting. The projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0 is exactly the eigenvector |v> itself, scaled by 1/√2? Wait, no, actually, |ψ_proj> is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, which is |v> scaled by 1.

But let's check the norm of |ψ_proj>:

|ψ_proj> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, so its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2).

So, the projection is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, which is of length sqrt(2). Therefore, to get the normalized projection, we divide by sqrt(2):

|ψ_proj> normalized is (1/√2)[ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

But do I need the normalized projection for the probability? Wait, no. The probability is the squared norm of |ψ_proj>. Because the Born rule says the probability is ||<v | ψ>||^2, which is ||ψ_proj>||^2.

So, the squared norm of |ψ_proj> is [ (-1)^2 + 0 +1^2 ] = 2.

Wait, but that would make the probability 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me double-check.

The projection |ψ_proj> is P_proj |ψ>, which is (1/2)|v><v|ψ>.

But |v><v|ψ> is the inner product <v|ψ>, which is the projection scalar. Then P_proj |ψ> is the outer product scaled by 1/(|v|^2). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the projection operator.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the inner product <v|ψ> first, then the probability is the square of its absolute value.

Let me try that approach.

Compute the inner product <v|ψ>:

|v> = [-1, 0, 1]^T
|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T

So, <v|ψ> = (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 +1 = 2.

Therefore, the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2 = 2^2 = 4.

Wait, that's also greater than 1. That can't be right. But the correct answer is √(2/3). So obviously, something's wrong here.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I need to consider that |v> is not normalized. Because |v> is [-1, 0, 1]^T, which has a norm of sqrt(2). So, to correctly compute the projection, we should normalize |v> first.

So, the projection should be (|v><v|)/(|v|^2). So, in that case, |v><v| is as we computed earlier:

[1, 0, -1]
[0, 0, 0]
[-1, 0, 1]

And |v|^2 is 2.

So, P_proj = (1/2)*[1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1].

Then, |ψ_proj> = P_proj |ψ> is:

(1/2)*[1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1] * [-1; 2; 1]

Compute each component:

First component: (1/2)*(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/2)*(-1 -1) = (1/2)*(-2) = -1

Second component: (1/2)*(0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1) = 0

Third component: (1/2)*(-1*(-1) + 0*2 +1*1) = (1/2)*(1 +0 +1) = (1/2)*2 = 1

So, |ψ_proj> = [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Wait, same as before. Then, the norm squared is (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 = 2, so the probability is 2, which is impossible.

This suggests that perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, wait, hold on. Maybe the observable P is not being correctly interpreted. Because sometimes, in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the sum over the projections onto each eigenspace.

But another thought: Maybe P itself is the observable, and we need to compute <ψ| P |ψ>. But that would give us the expectation value, not the probability. Hmm.

Wait, no. The expectation value is <ψ| P |ψ>, which is the average outcome. But the probability of getting 0 is different. So that approach might not help.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable is represented by P, so the eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes, and we need the probability that the outcome is 0.

So, to find that, we need to find the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, project |ψ> onto that eigenspace, and then compute the squared norm of the projection.

But earlier, we found that the eigenspace is one-dimensional with eigenvector [-1, 0, 1]^T.

So, the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenspace is:

|ψ_proj> = ((|v><v|)/(|v|^2)) |ψ>

Which is (1/2)|v><v| |ψ>

But |v><v| |ψ> = <v|ψ> |v>

So, <v|ψ> is 2, so |v><v| |ψ> = 2 |v>

Therefore, |ψ_proj> = (1/2)(2 |v>) = |v>

So, |ψ_proj> is |v>, which is [-1, 0, 1]^T, same as before.

Then, the norm squared of |ψ_proj> is 2, which is problematic because probability can't exceed 1.

Wait a minute, that can't be. So maybe the issue is that I'm not considering the correct observable. Wait, is P the observable, or is it P^2 or something else?

Wait, another thought: In quantum mechanics, the square of the observable is the operator that gives the probabilities. So, if P is the observable, then P^2 is the operator whose eigenvalues are the squares of the possible outcomes, and the probabilities are the squares of the projections onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

But in our case, if we have the observable as P, then the eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes, so the probability of getting 0 is the projection onto the eigenspace of 0.

Wait, but that gave us 2, which is impossible. So perhaps we're not correctly calculating the projection.

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Compute the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by |v> = [-1, 0, 1]^T.

So, the projection operator is (|v><v|)/||v||^2.

Which is |v> <v| / 2.

So, the projected state is (|v><v| / 2) |ψ>

Compute |v><v| |ψ>:

|v><v| is:

[1, 0, -1]
[0, 0, 0]
[-1, 0, 1]

So, |v><v| |ψ> is:

[1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1] * [-1; 2; 1] = [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1; 0; (-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1] = [ -1 -1; 0; 1 +1 ] = [ -2; 0; 2 ]

Then, divided by 2: [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T

So, |ψ_proj> is [-1, 0, 1]^T

Then, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0 +1^2 = 2, so probability is 2, which is impossible.

Wait, something is wrong here. Maybe I need to normalize the projection.

But the projection is |v><v| / ||v||^2 |ψ>

Which is (|v><v| / 2) |ψ> = |v> <v|ψ> / 2

But <v|ψ> is 2, so |v> <v|ψ> / 2 = |v> * 1, which is |v>, unnormalized.

Wait, maybe I should take the inner product <v|ψ> = 2, then the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2 / ||v||^2.

So, that would be (2)^2 / (sqrt(2))^2 = 4 / 2 = 2. Still 2.

That's not possible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the observable is not P, but some function of P, like P^2 or something else. Because P itself is a symmetric matrix, but what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is among them. If not, then the measurement cannot yield 0.

So, let's compute the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2    0   ]
[1/√2     0     1/√2 ]
[ 0     1/√2    0   ]

This looks like a symmetric matrix. Let me compute its trace and determinant to find the eigenvalues.

Trace of P is 0 + 0 +0
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of an observable will yield 0 at a certain time t. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), and the observable is represented by a matrix operator P. The matrix P has specific elements in each row, and I need to use these to find the probability.

First, let me write down what I know. The system's state is a column vector:

| -1 |
| 2  |
| 1  |

And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix given as:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, P looks like this:

[ 0    1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2   0    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2   0 ]

Okay, so P is a symmetric matrix. I remember that observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices, and this P is indeed symmetric, so it is Hermitian. That makes sense.

Now, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (or outcome) of an observable is given by the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenstate. Alternatively, it can be calculated using the expectation value or the Born rule.

Wait, more precisely, if the observable is represented by a Hermitian operator P, the probability of measuring a value λ_i is |⟨ψ|P_i|ψ⟩|², where P_i is the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ_i.

But to compute that, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, or at least find the projection onto the eigenstates of P.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value of P and see what the possible outcomes are, but since we are interested in the probability of the measurement yielding 0, that means we need the eigenvalue corresponding to 0, and then compute the probability accordingly.

Wait, let me think again.

In quantum mechanics, the measurable values are the eigenvalues of the operator P. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. If 0 is an eigenvalue of P, then the probability of measuring 0 is the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

But let me double-check. Since P is a Hermitian matrix, it can be diagonalized as P = V D V†, where V is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue λ_i is |⟨ψ| V e_i |ψ⟩|², where e_i is the standard basis vector.

Alternatively, the probability distribution can be found by projecting the state vector ψ onto each eigenspace of P and then computing the squared norm of each projection.

But in this case, the system is in a particular state ψ = |ψ⟩, which is a column vector, and we have an observable P. So, the probability of getting a result λ is given by |⟨λ| P |ψ⟩|², where |λ⟩ are the eigenstates of P.

But to do this, I need to know the eigenvalues and eigenstates of P. Alternatively, another formula: the probability is ⟨ψ| P† P |ψ⟩, but wait, no, because P is already Hermitian, so P† = P. So, the probability of measuring λ is ⟨ψ| E_λ |ψ⟩, where E_λ is the projection onto the eigenspace of λ.

Alternatively, another approach: Compute the expectation value of P, but that will give me the average value, not the probability.

Wait, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, and then see which eigenvalues correspond to 0, but looking at P, I should first check if 0 is an eigenvalue.

So, let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P.

Given that P is a 3x3 symmetric matrix, it will have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let me set up the matrix P - λI:

[ -λ     1/√2      0   ]
[1/√2   -λ     1/√2   ]
[ 0     1/√2    -λ    ]

Now, compute the determinant of this matrix.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me use expansion by minors on the first row since it has a zero which might make the computation easier.

So, determinant:

| -λ     1/√2      0    |
|1/√2   -λ     1/√2   |
| 0     1/√2    -λ    |

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det[ -λ     1/√2   ]
         [1/√2   -λ    ]

- (1/√2) * det[1/√2   1/√2   ]
                [ 0       -λ    ]

+ 0 * det[ ... ] (which is zero)

So, computing each minor:

First minor: det of the submatrix:

| -λ     1/√2   |
|1/√2   -λ    |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2

Second minor: det of the submatrix:

|1/√2   1/√2   |
| 0       -λ    |

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

So, putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) + 0

Simplify term by term:

First term: -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/2

So, determinant = (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

So, the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

-λ(λ² - 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1

Aha! So, eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Therefore, the possible outcomes of the measurement are 0, 1, and -1, each corresponding to their respective eigenvectors.

Therefore, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ = 0, and then compute the projection of the state vector ψ onto that eigenvector, and then square the norm of that projection to get the probability.

Alternatively, since P is diagonalizable, we can find an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors and express ψ in that basis, then the probability is the square of the coefficient corresponding to λ = 0.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, find eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ = 0.

So, for λ = 0, the matrix P - 0 I is just P:

[ 0    1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2   0    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2   0 ]

So, we have the system of equations:

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0

(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0

So, the first and third equations are the same: (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x

So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is of the form (x, 0, -x). We can choose x=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)

But since we need to orthonormalize the eigenvectors, we need to normalize it.

Compute the norm: sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

So, that's our eigenstate |0⟩.

Next, let's find the eigenvectors for λ = 1.

So, P - I = [1 - λ, ... ] Wait, but λ=1, so P - I:

[ 1 - 1    1/√2      0   ] = [0    1/√2   0 ]

[1/√2   1 - 1     1/√2   ] = [1/√2 0    1/√2]

[ 0      1/√2    1 - 1    ] = [0    1/√2   0 ]

So, the matrix becomes:

[ 0    1/√2   0 ]

[1/√2   0    1/√2]

[ 0    1/√2   0 ]

So, system of equations:

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0

(1/√2)x + 0*y + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x

0*x + (1/√2)y + 0*z = 0 => same as first equation, y = 0

So, same as for λ=0, but with an additional condition.

Wait, but wait. For λ=1, the equation is the same as for λ=0? That can't be. Because for λ=1, the system is:

(1/√2)y = 0 => y=0

x + z = 0

But in the P - I matrix, the (3,2) entry is 1/√2, same as P. So, same equations as for λ=0.

So, does it mean that the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=0 are the same? That can't be, unless 1 and 0 are both eigenvalues with the same eigenvectors, which is not possible for a symmetric matrix.

Wait, hold on. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for λ=1, the equations are same as for λ=0? That seems odd.

Wait, no, the system for λ=1 is:

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => y = 0

(1/√2)x + 0*y + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)y + 0*z = 0 => y=0

So, the same equations as for λ=0. So, in fact, the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=0 are the same? That can't be, unless the matrix is defective, but since P is symmetric, it should be diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps λ=1 has the same eigenvectors as λ=0? That can't be correct because the eigenvectors should be orthogonal for symmetric matrices.

Wait, but let me check. If the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=0 are the same, that would mean that their corresponding projections onto the observable P would have the same direction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in constructing P - λI for λ=1.

Wait, no, P - λI for λ=1 is indeed:

[0    1/√2   0]

[1/√2  0    1/√2]

[0    1/√2   0]

Which is the same as the original P for rows 1 and 3, but for λ=1, P - I would have 1 on the diagonal subtracted by λ.

Wait, no, no, hold on.

Wait, for λ=1, P - I is:

P - I = [0 - 1, 1/√2, 0]

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, sorry, no.

Wait, P is:

[0    1/√2   0]

[1/√2   0    1/√2]

[0    1/√2   0]

So, P - I is:

[-1    1/√2   0]

[1/√2  -1    1/√2]

[0     1/√2  -1]

So, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, I think I messed up. When I set λ=1, P - I should have -1 on the diagonal.

Wait, no, no, sorry. The matrix is P - λI, so for λ=1, it's P - I, which is:

[0 - 1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 0 - 1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -1 - 0]

Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, P is:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row:1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, P - I is:

First row: -1, 1/√2, 0

Second row:1/√2, -1, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, -1

So, as a matrix:

[ -1    1/√2    0 ]

[1/√2   -1    1/√2]

[ 0     1/√2   -1 ]

So, now, let's compute the determinant for λ=1.

But wait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvectors by solving (P - I)v = 0.

So, equations:

-1*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => -x + (1/√2)y = 0 => x = (1/√2)y

(1/√2)x - y + (1/√2)z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)y - z = 0 => (1/√2)y = z => z = (1/√2)y

So, from first equation: x = (1/√2)y

From third equation: z = (1/√2)y

So, let me let y = √2 for simplicity, then x=1 and z=1.

Thus, eigenvector is (1, √2, 1)

Check if this satisfies the second equation:

(1/√2)x - y + (1/√2)z = (1/√2)*1 - √2 + (1/√2)*1 = (2/√2) - √2 = √2 - √2 = 0

Yes, it does. So, eigenvector is (1, √2, 1)

Now, let's normalize this vector.

Compute the norm: sqrt(1² + (√2)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)

Similarly, for λ = -1, let's compute the eigenvectors.

So, P - (-1)I = P + I:

First row: 0 + 1, 1/√2, 0

Second row:1/√2, 0 + 1, 1/√2

Third row:0, 1/√2, 0 + 1

So:

[1    1/√2   0]

[1/√2 1    1/√2]

[0    1/√2   1]

So, the system is:

1*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => x + (1/√2)y = 0 => x = -(1/√2)y

(1/√2)x + 1*y + (1/√2)z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)y + 1*z = 0 => z = -(1/√2)y

So, from the first equation, x = -(1/√2)y

From the third equation, z = -(1/√2)y

So, let me set y = √2, then x = -1 and z = -1

So, eigenvector is (-1, √2, -1)

Check if this satisfies the second equation:

(1/√2)x + y + (1/√2)z = (1/√2)*(-1) + √2 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (-2/√2) + √2 = (-√2) + √2 = 0

Yes, it does.

So, eigenvector is (-1, √2, -1)

Normalizing: sqrt((-1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = 2

So, normalized eigenvector is (-1/2, √2/2
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, which is a bit new to me, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what's going on.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, okay, so that's the state vector, right? Let me write that down:

State vector, let's call it |ψ⟩, is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1 ]
      [  2 ]
      [  1 ]

So it's a 3x1 column matrix.

Then, there's an observable, which is represented by a matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write that out:

P = [  0      1/√2    0   ]
    [ 1/√2    0     1/√2 ]
    [  0      1/√2    0   ]

Alright, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices, right? Let me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Looking at P, the entries are real, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. Let me transpose P:

P^T = [  0     1/√2    0  ]
       [1/√2    0    1/√2]
       [ 0     1/√2    0  ]

Which is the same as P. So yes, P is Hermitian, that checks out.

The question is asking for the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t. To find this probability, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a value is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of that value in the eigenstates of the observable.

But wait, let me recall the steps. The general process is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable (matrix) P.
2. Express the state vector |ψ⟩ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.
3. The coefficients of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 will give the amplitude, and the square of the absolute value of that coefficient is the probability.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let's compute the determinant of (P - λI):

P - λI = [  -λ      1/√2      0   ]
         [1/√2     -λ     1/√2 ]
         [  0      1/√2    -λ   ]

Now, compute the determinant of this matrix.

Determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix:

det = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

So, applying that to our matrix:

a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0

d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2

g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

So,

det = (-λ)[(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2)[(1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0)] + 0*(something)

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)[(λ²) - (1/2)] = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2)

Second term: (1/√2)[( -λ/√2 ) - 0] = (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (-λ)/2

Third term: 0*(...) = 0

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - ( -λ/2 ) + 0

Wait, hold on, let me re-express that:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) + 0

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs earlier. Let me redo the determinant calculation step more carefully.

det(P - λI) = (-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*(... something)

Compute each component:

First minor (for a): (-λ)( (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2)

Second minor (for b): - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] = - (1/√2)[ -λ/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = - ( -λ / 2 ) = λ / 2

Third term is zero.

So, determinant:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ / 2 )

Simplify:

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ

So, the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

Which gives λ = 0, or -λ² + 1 = 0 => λ² = 1 => λ = ±1

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1

Got it, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Now, we need the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ = 0.

For λ = 0, solve (P - 0I)|v⟩ = 0 => P|v⟩ = 0

So, P|v⟩ = 0 =>

[ 0      1/√2    0   ] [v1]   [0]
[1/√2    0     1/√2 ] [v2] = [0]
[ 0      1/√2    0   ] [v3]   [0]

So, writing this as a system of equations:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0

2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

3. (1/√2) v2 = 0

From equation 1 and 3, we get v2 = 0.

From equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

So, let's set v3 = t (some parameter), then v1 = -t, v2 = 0, v3 = t

Thus, the eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to [-1, 0, 1]^T

So, we can write |0⟩ (eigenstate) as:

|0⟩ = [ -1 ]
         [ 0  ]
         [ 1  ]

But normalized. Let's compute its norm:

|||0⟩||^2 = (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

So, normalize it by dividing by √2:

|0⟩ = (1/√2) [ -1 ]
             [ 0  ]
             [ 1  ]

Okay, so that's the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.

Next, let's find the eigenvectors for λ = 1.

So, solving (P - I)|v⟩ = 0

Compute P - I:

[  -1      1/√2      0   ]
[1/√2    -1     1/√2 ]
[  0      1/√2     -1   ]

So, the matrix is:

Row 1: -1, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, -1, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -1

Let me write the equations:

1. (-1) v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 => -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0

2. (1/√2) v1 + (-1) v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

3. 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + (-1) v3 = 0 => (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0

So, from equation 1: -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

From equation 3: (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

So, let me set v2 = t (some parameter). Then,

v1 = (1/√2) t

v3 = (1/√2) t

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T

Let's check if this works in equation 2:

(1/√2)(1/√2) + (-1)(1) + (1/√2)(1/√2) = (1/2) - 1 + (1/2) = 0. Perfect.

So, the eigenvector for λ=1 is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T. Let's normalize it.

Compute the norm squared:

(1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2

So, again, it's already normalized, so:

|1⟩ = [1/√2]
          [1   ]
          [1/√2]

Similarly, for λ=-1, let's find the eigenvector.

Compute P - (-1)I = P + I

So:

[  1      1/√2     0   ]
[1/√2     1     1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2     1   ]

So, the system of equations:

1. 1*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2) v2

2. (1/√2) v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

3. 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 1*v3 = 0 => (1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Let me set v2 = t, then:

v1 = - (1/√2) t

v3 = - (1/√2) t

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T

Check equation 2:

(1/√2)(-1/√2) + (1)(1) + (1/√2)(-1/√2) = (-1/2) + 1 + (-1/2) = 0. Perfect.

So, the eigenvector is [-1/√2, 1, -1/√2]^T. Let's compute its norm:

(-1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (-1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2

So, normalized, it's:

|-1⟩ = [ -1/√2 ]
          [ 1   ]
          [ -1/√2 ]

So, now, we have the eigenstates for each eigenvalue:

For λ=0: |0⟩ = (1/√2)[-1, 0, 1]^T

For λ=1: |1⟩ = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T

For λ=-1: |-1⟩ = [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T

Now, the state vector |ψ⟩ is [-1, 2, 1]^T. To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to express |ψ⟩ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors |0⟩, |1⟩, |-1⟩, and find the coefficient for |0⟩.

So, let's set up the expansion:

|ψ⟩ = c0 |0⟩ + c1 |1⟩ + c-1 |-1⟩

We can write this as:

[ -1 ]   [ -1/√2 ]   [ 1/√2 ]   [ -1/√2 ]
[ 2 ] = c0 [  0    ] + c1 [ 1    ] + c-1 [ 1    ]
[ 1 ]   [  1/√2 ]   [1/√2 ]   [ -1/√2 ]

Wait, hold on. Let me write |0⟩, |1⟩, |-1⟩ properly.

Wait, actually, |0⟩, |1⟩, |-1⟩ are column vectors:

|0⟩ = (1/√2)[ -1; 0; 1 ]

|1⟩ = [1/√2; 1; 1/√2 ]

|-1⟩ = (1/√2)[ -1; 1; -1 ]

So, more precisely:

|ψ⟩ = c0 |0⟩ + c1 |1⟩ + c-1 |-1⟩

Which is:

[ -1 ]   [ -1/√2 ]   [ 1/√2 ]   [ -1/√2 ]
[ 2 ] = c0 [ 0      ] + c1 [ 1     ] + c-1 [ 1    ]
[ 1 ]   [  1/√2 ]   [1/√2 ]   [ -1/√2 ]

So, writing the components:

Row 1: -1 = c0*(-1/√2) + c1*(1/√2) + c-1*(-1/√2)

Row 2: 2 = c0*0 + c1*1 + c-1*1

Row 3: 1 = c0*(1/√2) + c1*(1/√2) + c-1*(-1/√2)

So, we have three equations:

1. (-1/√2) c0 + (1/√2) c1 - (1/√2) c-1 = -1

2. c1 + c-1 = 2

3. (1/√2) c0 + (1/√2) c1 - (1/√2) c-1 = 1

Let me write these equations more neatly:

Equation 1: (-1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)c1 - (1/√2)c-1 = -1

Equation 2: c1 + c-1 = 2

Equation 3: (1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)c1 - (1/√2)c-1 = 1

Hmm, perhaps we can add equations 1 and 3 to eliminate c-1.

Let me try that.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 3:

[ (-1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)c1 - (1/√2)c-1 ] + [ (1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)c1 - (1/√2)c-1 ] = (-1) + 1

Simplify left side:

(-1/√2 + 1/√2)c0 + (1/√2 + 1/√2)c1 + (-1/√2 -1/√2)c-1

Which is 0*c0 + (2/√2)c1 + (-2/√2)c-1

Right side: 0

So,

(2/√2)c1 - (2/√2)c-1 = 0

Divide both sides by 2/√2:

c1 - c-1 = 0 => c1 = c-1

Okay, that's useful. So c1 = c-1.

From Equation 2: c1 + c-1 = 2

But c1 = c-1, so 2c1 = 2 => c1 = 1 => c-1 =1

So, c1=1, c-1=1

Now, plug c1=1, c-1=1 into Equation 1 or 3.

Let me use Equation 3:

(1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)*1 - (1/√2)*1 = 1

Simplify:

(1/√2)c0 + (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 1 => (1/√2)c0 = 1 => c0 = √2

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that again.

Equation 3:

(1/√2)c0 + (1/√2)c1 - (1/√2)c-1 =
[overthinking]
Alright, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, we have a system whose state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). That means the state vector is a column vector with three components: -1, 2, and 1. 

Then, there's this observable, which is represented by a matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row has elements (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row has (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, P is a 3x3 matrix. 

The question is asking for the probability that a measurement of this observable will yield 0 at time t. Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of that eigenstate in the system's state. So, first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the observable P, because the observable's measurement outcomes correspond to its eigenvalues.

Wait, but hold on. Is P already diagonalized? Because the given matrix P doesn't look like it's diagonal, so maybe I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenstates. Alternatively, perhaps the system is already in the eigenbasis of P, so maybe I don't need to diagonalize it. Hmm, not sure. Let's think more carefully.

In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and their measurements correspond to their eigenvalues. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto the corresponding eigenvectors. So, the process should be something like: find the eigenvectors of P, project the state vector onto each eigenvector, square the magnitudes of those projections, and then sum them to get the probability.

But before that, let me confirm if P is Hermitian. Since P is given as a matrix with real entries, but is it symmetric? Let's check.

Looking at P:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Second row: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Third row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So, P is symmetric because the element in the first row, second column is 1/√2, and the second row, first column is also 1/√2. Similarly, the second row, third column is 1/√2, and the third row, second column is 1/√2. So, yes, P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. Good, so it's a valid observable.

So, now, the eigenvalues of P are real, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then project the state onto each eigenvector, and then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe the observable P has some symmetry or structure that allows the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be found more easily. Let me think about that.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/√2 off-diagonal in the first and third positions. Wait, actually, no. Wait, first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], so the first row has non-zero only in the second column. The second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], so it has non-zero in first and third columns. The third row is [0, 1/√2, 0], which is the same as the first row. So, it's a tridiagonal matrix? No, wait, it's not tridiagonal because the third row only connects to the second column, not the fourth or fifth. Wait, but it's 3x3, so the connections are first row to second column, second row to first and third columns, and third row to second column. So, it's like a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal except for the first and third rows, which only have one non-zero element each.

Wait, maybe it's a symmetric matrix where the middle row connects to both the first and third rows, but the first and third rows only connect to the middle. So, the structure is like a dumbbell shape. That might make it easier to find eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this matrix as a graph Laplacian or something similar, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe we can guess the eigenvectors. Let me see.

Given the symmetry, perhaps the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. For instance, maybe we can have an eigenvector with components (a, b, a), or (a, b, c) with some symmetries.

But let's try to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors more directly.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let's write down the matrix P - λI:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So, we can compute the determinant of this matrix.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

|A| = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[ a, b, c ]

[ d, e, f ]

[ g, h, i ]

So, applying that to our matrix P - λI:

First row: -λ, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, -λ

So, determinant is:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ (1/√2)(1/√2) - (-λ)(0) ]

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: (-λ) * [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ]

Third term: 0, so it's 0.

So, the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) + 0

Simplify term by term.

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (λ)/(2)

So, adding both terms:

(-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2 + λ/2) = -λ³ + λ

So, determinant equation:

-λ³ + λ = 0

So, factor:

-λ(λ² - 1) = 0

Thus, eigenvalues are λ = 0, and λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, the measurement outcomes will be 0, 1, -1.

So, to find the probability of getting 0, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, project the state vector onto that eigenvector, and then square the magnitude of that projection.

So, let me first find the eigenvector for λ=0.

So, for λ=0, we solve (P - 0I)v = 0, so P v = 0.

So, the matrix P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

So, we need to solve P v = 0. That is:

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0

(1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0

So, simplifying, we get:

From first equation: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

From third equation: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => same as above, so v2 = 0.

From the second equation: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.

Therefore, the eigenvector satisfies v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1], where v1 is arbitrary.

So, we can choose v1 = 1, so the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1].

But we need to normalize it, right? Because eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.

So, the norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So, that's the unit vector corresponding to λ=0.

Now, to find the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1).

So, let me denote the state vector as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

The projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is given by:

P_0 = (|ψ> ⋅ |φ>) |φ>

So, compute the inner product: (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Wait, so the inner product is -√2.

Therefore, the projection operator P_0 gives:

P_0 |ψ> = (-√2) |φ>

Therefore, the probability is the squared magnitude of this projection:

| -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, but that's 2, which is greater than 1. But probabilities can't exceed 1. That doesn't make sense. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.

First, let's recompute the inner product.

|ψ> is [-1, 2, 1], and |φ> is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2].

Dot product: (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Hmm, that's correct. So, the inner product is -√2.

But then the projection is (-√2) times |φ>, which has magnitude √2 times |φ>, so the squared magnitude would be (√2)^2 = 2. Hmm, that's an issue because probabilities can't be more than 1. So, that suggests that either I made a mistake in normalizing the eigenvector, or maybe I need to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the eigenvectors are not orthonormal? Wait, but in quantum mechanics, we usually take eigenvectors to be orthonormal, but in this case, maybe I messed up in the normalization.

Wait, the eigenvector was [1, 0, -1], which had a norm of √(1 + 0 + 1) = √2, so normalized as 1/√2 [1, 0, -1], which is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]. So, that's correct.

Then, the inner product is |ψ> ⋅ |φ> = (-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

So that's correct. So, the projection is |ψ> onto |φ> is (|ψ ⋅ φ| / ||φ||^2) φ.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the projection formula. Let me recall the formula for projection.

The projection of |ψ> onto |φ> is ( <φ|ψ> ) / ( <φ|φ> ) |φ>

Wait, so that's ( <φ|ψ> ) divided by the norm squared of φ, times φ.

But in our case, <φ|φ> is 1 because it's normalized.

So, the projection is ( <φ|ψ> ) |φ> = (-√2) |φ>

But wait, this is correct, but then the norm squared is (-√2)^2 = 2, which is more than 1.

But that's impossible for a probability.

Wait, so what's the issue here?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the observable. Perhaps the observable is not P, but some other operator?

Wait, the problem says: "An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P".

So, the observable is P itself.

Wait, unless P is not the observable but something else, but the problem says it's the matrix operator P.

Wait, unless P is not a Hermitian matrix? Wait, no, earlier we saw that P is symmetric, so it is Hermitian.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Perhaps the state is not normalized?

Let me check the norm of the state vector.

Compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So, the state vector is not normalized. So, the probability should be computed using the normalized state.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically considered as normalized vectors, but here it's given as (-1, 2, 1). So, perhaps the state is not normalized, but in that case, the probability should be |<φ|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||².

So, the projection is <φ|ψ> = -√2 as before, and the norm of ψ is √6.

So, |<φ|ψ>|² / ||ψ||² = ( (√2)^2 ) / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, so that would make the probability 1/3. But the correct answer is supposed to be √(2/3). Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, so if |ψ> is not normalized, then the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

In our case, |<φ|ψ>|² = ( -√2 )² = 2.

||ψ||² = 6.

Therefore, probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But again, that's not the given answer. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in finding the eigenvector.

Wait, let's go back to P.

We had P as:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

So, for λ=0, we have the equations:

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

(1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2=0

So, the eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1].

So, if v1=1, it's [1, 0, -1], which we normalized to [1/√2, 0, -1/√2].

So, that part is correct.

Then, the inner product is (-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the projection is (-√2) * |φ>, and the squared magnitude is 2.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is supposed to be normalized, so if we have a state |ψ>, we often normalize it as <ψ|ψ> = 1. So perhaps I need to use the normalized state.

So, if |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1), then its norm is √6, as before.

Therefore, the probability is |<φ|ψ>|² / ||ψ||² = | (-√2) |² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Hmm, that's 1/3, not √(2/3). Hmm, perhaps I need to consider another approach.

Wait, maybe I need to find the eigenstates of P, but then the observable could be different. Or perhaps P is being measured in a different basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is actually P, but the system is not in an eigenstate of P. Therefore, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to write the state as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P, and then the probability is the square of the coefficient in front
