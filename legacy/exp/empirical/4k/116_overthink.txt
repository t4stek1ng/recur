Alright, so I have this problem with three spin-1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. Spin operators S1, S2, S3 are vectors, and their dot product S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). For spin-1/2 particles, each S_i has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 along their respective axes.

The given state psi seems to be a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. Specifically, it's a sum of three terms where each term has two up spins and one down spin, but each down spin is in a different position. So, it's an equally weighted combination of all possible states with two up and one down. That makes me think it's a singlet-like state or perhaps a triplet state, but since each term has two up and one down, maybe it's part of a different representation.

Since the Hamiltonian involves the sum of dot products of all pairs of spin operators, maybe it's useful to consider the total spin or total spin squared. Let me recall that the sum of pairwise dot products is related to the total spin squared operator.

Indeed, the identity is:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)

So, H can be rewritten as:

H = A*(1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)

Since each spin is spin-1/2, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, H becomes:

H = A*(1/2)(S_total^2 - (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ħ^2) = A*(1/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ^2)

Simplify:

H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(9/4) ħ^2 = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ^2

Okay, so H is expressed in terms of S_total squared. So, to determine if psi is an eigenfunction of H, we need to check whether psi is an eigenfunction of S_total squared.

What is S_total? S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. The eigenvalues of S_total squared are S(S+1)ħ^2, where S is the total spin quantum number.

So, if I can figure out what S is for the state psi, I can find the eigenvalue of S_total squared, and hence of H.

Given that psi is a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let me think about the possible total spin states.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down. Let's compute the total spin of each term.

The state |up1 up2 down3> corresponds to S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 -1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. Similarly for the other terms.

So, each term in psi has S_z = 1/2 ħ.

But the total spin S can be different. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be S = 3/2 (triplet) or S = 1/2 (singlet). However, in this case, since each term has two up and one down, the maximum total spin is when all three are up, but here, each term is missing one up, so S can't be 3/2. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each term is a state with two spins up and one spin down. So, the maximum total spin is when the down spin is on the same particle, but that's not the case here. Actually, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of the spins, so it's part of the symmetric subspace.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the state psi. Let me try that.

So, let's consider S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But from our earlier identity, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of S_total^2 are known once we know the total spin S. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible S values are 1/2 and 3/2.

Wait, let me confirm: for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 (all spins aligned) or 1/2. But let me think about the state psi: it's a symmetric state with two up and one down. So, what is the total spin of such a state?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

But perhaps it's easier to use the fact that psi is in the space of symmetric states with two up and one down. Let me think about the possible total spin for such a state.

Wait, another approach: if we have three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states can be constructed by symmetrizing different combinations. The state psi is symmetric under permutation, so it must be in the symmetric subspace.

But each term in psi has two up and one down. So, the possible total spin S of psi can be 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (total spin 1/2) is symmetric, but if we have two up and one down, maybe it's part of the triplet. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi. Because if the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H will be an eigenstate as well.

So, let's compute <psi|S_total^2|psi>. Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, expanding it gives:

S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, the expectation value is:

<psi|S_total^2|psi> = <psi|S1^2|psi> + <psi|S2^2|psi> + <psi|S3^2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S3|psi> + 2<psi|S2·S3|psi>

Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, and the state psi is symmetric, I can compute these expectation values.

First, <psi|S_i^2|psi> = (3/4)ħ^2 for each i, so the sum is 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

Now, compute the cross terms: 2<psi|S1·S2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S3|psi> + 2<psi|S2·S3|psi>

But since the state is symmetric, each of these expectation values should be the same. Let's compute <psi|S1·S2|psi>.

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)

So, <psi|S1·S2|psi> = <psi|S1^x S2^x|psi> + <psi|S1^y S2^y|psi> + <psi|S1^z S2^z|psi>

We need to compute each of these terms.

First, let me think about S1^z S2^z. The action of S1^z on the first spin and S2^z on the second spin.

The state psi is 1/sqrt(3)*( |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> )

So, let me write psi as a sum over basis states:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term |a b c⟩ corresponds to particles 1,2,3 being a, b, c respectively.

Now, S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩
Similarly, S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩
So, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ)(-1/2 ħ) |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩

Wait, no, hold on. When S2 acts on |↑↓↑⟩, the second spin is down, so S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/2 ħ) |↑↓↑⟩. So, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ)(-1/2 ħ) |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩

So, when we compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>, we have:

(1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]^† multiplied by S1^z S2^z acting on psi.

But let's compute it step by step.

Compute (S1^z S2^z) psi:

(S1^z S2^z) psi = (S1^z S2^z)(1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

= (1/sqrt(3)) [ S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ + S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ + S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ ]

As computed above:

S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩

S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩

S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩

So, putting it together:

(S1^z S2^z) psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩ - (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓↑⟩ - (1/4 ħ^2) |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Factor out 1/(4 sqrt(3) ħ^2):

= (1/(4 sqrt(3) ħ^2)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Now, the inner product <psi | S1^z S2^z |psi> is:

(1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ] * [ (1/(4 sqrt(3) ħ^2)) (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩) ]

= (1/(4*3 ħ^2)) [ (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) (|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩ ) ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/(12 ħ^2)) [ |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ - |↑↑↓⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ ]

Simplify each term:

- |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 1 (since same state)
- |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 0 (orthogonal)
- |↑↑↓⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ = 0 (orthogonal)
Similarly, the next terms:

- |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 0
- |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 1
- |↑↓↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ = 0
- |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 0
- |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 0
- |↓↑↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ =1

Wait, but hold on, the cross terms:

Wait, actually, the inner product of |a b c⟩ and |d e f⟩ is 1 if a=d, b=e, c=f, else 0.

So, let's list each term:

1. |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 1
2. |↑↑↓⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 0
3. |↑↑↓⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ = 0
4. |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 0
5. |↑↓↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 1
6. |↑↓↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ = 0
7. |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↑↓⟩ = 0
8. |↓↑↑⟩·|↑↓↑⟩ = 0
9. |↓↑↑⟩·|↓↑↑⟩ =1

So, the total is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, <psi | S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/(12 ħ^2)) * 3 = 1/(4 ħ^2).

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is the same as S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y. Wait, is that true? Hmm, maybe not exactly, because the cross terms could have different signs.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute all three terms separately.

Wait, but in the above, S1^z S2^z gave me 1/(4 ħ^2). But what about S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y?

Hmm, that's more complicated. Maybe I should think about the expectation value of S_i · S_j.

But maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i · S_j in a singlet state is (-3/4)ħ^2, because S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2). For a singlet state, S_total^2 = 0, so S_i · S_j = (1/2)(-3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2) = (-3/8)ħ^2. Wait, maybe that's not right.

Wait, let me compute S_i · S_j for two spin-1/2 particles. The total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). For the singlet state, S_total^2 = 0, so S_i · S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2 = (0 - (3/4 ħ^2) - (3/4 ħ^2))/2 = (-3/2 ħ^2)/2 = (-3/4) ħ^2.

For the triplet states, S_total^2 = 2 ħ^2 (since S=1, so S(S+1) = 2), so S_i · S_j = (2 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2)/2 = (2 ħ^2 - 1.5 ħ^2)/2 = (0.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall what I know about spin systems. Each spin 1/2 particle has spin-½, so their spin operators S_i satisfy the relation S_i^2 = (ℏ/2)I for each i. The total spin S = S1 + S2 + S3. For three particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The Hamiltonian H is a sum of pairwise dot products of spin operators. So H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). I remember that S_i·S_j can be written in terms of the total spin squared. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (S^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So, maybe I can rewrite H in terms of S^2, which could simplify things.

Let me try that:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)
= A*[ (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ]

Let me compute this step by step. Each term is (S^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2 for each pair (i,j). So adding them up:

= A*( [ (S^2 - S1^2 - S2^2) + (S^2 - S1^2 - S3^2) + (S^2 - S2^2 - S3^2) ] / 2 )
= A*( [ 3S^2 - 2S1^2 - 2S2^2 - 2S3^2 ] / 2 )
= (A/2)*(3S^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))

But since each S_i^2 = (ℏ²/4)I, so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = (3ℏ²/4)I.

Therefore,

H = (A/2)*(3S^2 - 2*(3ℏ²/4)I)
= (A/2)*(3S^2 - (3ℏ²/2)I)
= (A/2)*(3(S^2 - (ℏ²/4)I))
= (3A/2)*(S^2 - (ℏ²/4)I)
= (3A/2) S^2 - (3A/2)(ℏ²/4)I
= (3A/2) S^2 - (3A ℏ²)/8 I

So H can be written as (3A/2) S^2 - (3A ℏ²)/8 I.

Now, if I can find the expectation value of S^2 in the state psi, then I can compute the expectation value of H.

The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). Let me try to compute the total spin squared expectation value in this state.

To compute <S^2>, I need to know the total spin S of this state. Let me check if the state is symmetric, antisymmetric, or something else.

Looking at the state, it's a symmetric combination of three terms where two spins are up and one is down. Let me see the permutation of particles. Each term is a permutation of one up and two ups. Wait, no, each term has two ups and one down.

Wait, each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So it's a symmetric state under permutation of particles, because each term is a permutation of the others. So the state is symmetric under permutation.

What is the total spin of such a state? For three spin-½ particles, the possible total spin states are S=3/2 and S=1/2. But since the state is symmetric, let's see if it's part of the S=1/2 or S=3/2 representation.

Wait, for three spin-½ particles, the symmetric states form the triplet states (S=1/2 if all spins are up or something else?), no wait: actually, for three spin-½ particles, the maximum spin is 3/2, and the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

But the state psi is symmetric, so it's either part of the 3/2 multiplet or part of the 1/2 multiplet. How can I tell?

Let me try to compute the total spin squared <S^2> for this state.

Since S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S^2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2H/(A) since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So S^2 = (3ℏ²/4)I + 2H/(A).

But I can also compute <S^2> in the state psi. Let's do that.

First, compute <psi|S^2|psi>.

But S^2 is a sum of squares and pairwise spin interactions.

Alternatively, since I know the state is symmetric, I can think about whether it's an eigenstate of S^2.

But maybe I can compute the expectation value directly.

Alternatively, note that for a state with two spins up and one spin down, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2. Let's check what the multiplicity is.

Wait, for three spin-½ particles, the symmetric states have S=3/2 and S=1/2.

There is only one symmetric state with S=3/2 and three symmetric states with S=1/2.

Given that our state is symmetric and has two up spins and one down, it might belong to the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, let me think. For each pair of particles, the possible total spin is 0 or 1. For three particles, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <S^2> by using the formula:

<S^2> = <psi| S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi>

Which is equal to <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >

But S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the spin singlet and triplet states. Alternatively, for each pair, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be computed.

But maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian H itself, given the state.

Wait, because H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>)

So, if I can compute the expectation values of each S_i·S_j, then I can compute <H>.

Let me compute each <S_i·S_j> in the state psi.

For each pair (i,j), compute <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>.

Each S_i·S_j = (1/4)( |↑↑⟩⟨↑↑| + |↑↓⟩⟨↓↑| + |↓↑⟩⟨↑↓| + |↓↓⟩⟨↓↓| ) - (1/4)( |↑↓⟩⟨↑↑| + |↑↑⟩⟨↓↑| + |↓↑⟩⟨↑↑| + |↑↑⟩⟨↓↓| + |↓↑⟩⟨↑↑| + |↑↑⟩⟨↓↓| )

Wait, no. Actually, S_i·S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z)

So, perhaps I can compute each component separately.

Alternatively, consider the expected value of S_i·S_j.

Note that for two spin-½ particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j in a state |α⟩ is (⟨α| S_i·S_j |α⟩).

But since our state psi is a product of spin states for each particle, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value for each pair.

Wait, let's look at the state psi:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

So, it's a symmetric combination of three states where exactly two spins are up and one is down.

So, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>

First, S1·S2 acts on the first and second particles.

Compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in psi.

Similarly, compute the expectation value of S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Let me do this step by step.

First, for <S1·S2>:

We can write S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2.

But since S1^2 = (ℏ/2) I and similarly for S2^2, so:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (ℏ/2 + ℏ/2)/2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (ℏ/2)

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (ℏ/2)

So, let's compute <(S1 + S2)^2> in psi.

(S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2

So, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>

But we need to compute this expectation value.

However, since we don't know <S1·S2>, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 directly.

Let me recall that for two spin-½ particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a state |s1, s2⟩ is:

( s1·s2 ) = (1/2)( (s1 + s2)^2 - s1^2 - s2^2 )

But given that |s1, s2⟩ is a product state, so it's a combination of spin-up and spin-down.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, in the state psi, the entire system is in a particular state. Let me see the states involved.

Each term in psi is two up and one down. For each term, say |↑↑↓⟩, we can consider how S1·S2 acts on it.

Wait, let's write the state psi as:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each of these terms is a permutation of two ups and one down.

Compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>

Since S1·S2 is an operator that acts on particles 1 and 2, let's see how it acts on each term.

First, for |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acts as follows:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ( (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) ) |↑↑↓⟩

Compute each component:

S1^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑↑↓⟩
Similarly, S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑↑↓⟩

So, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩

For S1^x and S1^y, acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩
S1^x |↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑⟩

Similarly, S1^y |↑⟩ = -i (ℏ/2)|↓⟩
S1^y |↓⟩ = i (ℏ/2)|↑⟩

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^x |↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩ ⊗ (ℏ/2)|↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩ but with a phase factor: (-i)(i) = 1, so it's (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩

Wait, let me compute more carefully.

S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^x |↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩ ⊗ (ℏ/2)|↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^y |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^y |↑⟩ = (-i)(ℏ/2)|↓⟩ ⊗ (i)(ℏ/2)|↓⟩ = (-i)(i)(ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩

Similarly, S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)^2 |↑↑↓⟩

So, overall:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩ + (ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩ + (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩
= (ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4)|↓↓⟩ + (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩
= (ℏ²/2)|↓↓⟩ + (ℏ²/4)|↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, for the term |↑↓↑⟩:

S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)|↑↓↑⟩

Compute each term:

S1^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑↓↑⟩
S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (-ℏ/2)|↑↓↑⟩

So, S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)(-ℏ/2)|↑↓↑⟩ = - (ℏ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩

For S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩
S1^x |↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑⟩
So, for the first qubit, S1^x |↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩, and for the second qubit, S2^x |↓⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↑⟩. So:

S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑⟩ = (ℏ/2)|↓⟩ ⊗ (ℏ/2)|↑⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↑⟩

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑⟩:

S1^y |↑⟩ = (-i)(ℏ/2)|↓⟩
S1^y |↓⟩ = (i)(ℏ/2)|↑⟩
So, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑⟩ = (-i)(ℏ/2)|↓⟩ ⊗ (i)(ℏ/2)|↑⟩ = (-i)(i)(ℏ²/4)|↓↑⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↑⟩

So, putting it together:

S1·S2 |↑↓↑⟩ = (ℏ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (ℏ²/4)|↓↑⟩ + (-ℏ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩
= (ℏ²/2)|↓↑⟩ - (ℏ²/4)|↑↓↑⟩

Similarly, for |↓↑↑⟩:

S1·S2 |↓↑↑⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)|↓↑↑⟩

Compute each term:

S1^z |↓↑↑

Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by \( H = A*(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \), where \( A \) is a constant. The state provided is \( \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}*(|\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3> + |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3> + |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3>) \). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of \( H \), and if not, what's the expectation value of the energy.

First, I need to recall what eigenfunctions and expectation values mean. An eigenfunction of \( H \) satisfies \( H|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle \), meaning applying \( H \) doesn't change the state, just scales it by an eigenvalue \( E \). If it's not an eigenfunction, then \( H|\psi\rangle \) is a different state, and the expectation value is calculated by \( \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle \).

So, the plan is: first, check if \( H|\psi\rangle \) is proportional to \( |\psi\rangle \). If yes, then it's an eigenfunction with eigenvalue \( E \). If not, compute the expectation value.

But before jumping into calculations, maybe I can look for symmetries or properties of the state and the Hamiltonian that can help.

The Hamiltonian is symmetric in all three spins, so it should have certain symmetric properties. The state \( \psi \) is symmetric as well. Let me see: each term in \( \psi \) has two spins up and one spin down. The permutations of the positions of the down spin are covered in the sum, so it's a symmetric combination.

So, both \( H \) and \( \psi \) have symmetric properties, but I don't know if that guarantees they share eigenstates.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the state \( \psi \) in terms of total spin operators. Since \( H \) is a sum of pairwise spin dot products, perhaps expressing \( \psi \) in terms of the total spin \( S_{\text{total}} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \) could help.

Wait, \( S_{\text{total}}^2 = (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \). So, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \):

\( H = A*(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) = \frac{A}{2}(S_{\text{total}}^2 - S_1^2 - S_2^2 - S_3^2) \)

But since each \( S_i^2 \) for a spin 1/2 particle is \( \frac{3}{4}\hbar^2 \), so:

\( H = \frac{A}{2}(S_{\text{total}}^2 - 3 \times \frac{3}{4}\hbar^2) \)

Simplify:

\( H = \frac{A}{2} S_{\text{total}}^2 - \frac{9A}{8}\hbar^2 \)

So, \( H \) is expressed in terms of \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) and a constant.

Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) for the state \( \psi \), I can find the energy eigenvalue.

So, let's compute \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) for \( \psi \).

First, \( S_{\text{total}}^2 = (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 \cdot S_2 + S_1 \cdot S_3 + S_2 \cdot S_3) \)

But as \( H \) is already expressed as a combination of these, perhaps it's better to consider the eigenvalues in terms of total spin. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are \( S = 3/2 \) and \( S = 1/2 \). The eigenvalues of \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) are \( \hbar^2 S(S+1) \).

So, if \( \psi \) is an eigenstate of \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \), then it's also an eigenstate of \( H \). Let's check whether \( \psi \) is an eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) acting on \( \psi \).

But this seems a bit involved because \( S_{\text{total}}^2 \) is a large operator. Maybe a better approach is to consider the action of \( S_1 \cdot S_2 \) on the state \( \psi \), because \( H \) is a sum of such terms.

Wait, let me see. Each term in \( H \) is \( S_i \cdot S_j \). So, perhaps if I can compute the expectation value of each \( S_i \cdot S_j \) in state \( \psi \), then I can sum them up and multiply by \( A \) to get the expectation value.

Yes, that might be a more straightforward approach.

So, let me compute \( \langle \psi | S_i \cdot S_j | \psi \rangle \) for each pair \( i,j \), then sum them and multiply by \( A \).

First, note that for spin-1/2 particles, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2}(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2) \). So, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{2}(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2) \).

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since each spin is 1/2, \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4}(S_i^2 + S_j^2) - \frac{1}{2} S_{i+j}^2 \). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute \( S_i \cdot S_j \) in terms of their matrix representations, but that might be too involved.

Wait, but considering that each spin is 1/2, so \( S_i \) and \( S_j \) have eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). So, maybe we can compute the expectation value \( \langle S_i \cdot S_j \rangle \) as \( \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle \), where \( \sigma_i \) are the Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value \( \langle S_i \cdot S_j \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle \), and the expectation value of \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \) can be found by considering the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state has \( S_i \cdot S_j = -\frac{3}{4}\hbar^2 \), and the triplet states have \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 \).

So, in the state \( \psi \), for each pair \( i,j \), we need to find the expectation value of \( S_i \cdot S_j \). Let's see.

But in the given state \( \psi \), each term is a product state with two spins up and one spin down. So, for each pair \( i,j \), let's see what the expectation value is.

For a pair \( i,j \), the states where \( i \) and \( j \) are both up or both down or one up and one down.

But wait, in the state \( \psi \), each product state has two spins up and one spin down. So, for example, in each term of \( \psi \), two spins are up and one is down.

Therefore, for each pair \( i,j \), in each term of \( \psi \), either both are up, both are down, or one is up and the other is down.

Wait, no, in each term, only one spin is down. So, for a pair \( i,j \), in each term of \( \psi \), exactly one of the spins is down, which could be either \( i \) or \( j \) or the third spin.

Wait, no. For example, in the first term, \( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \), the pair \(1,2\) are both up, pair \(1,3\) have one up and one down, and pair \(2,3\) have one up and one down.

Similarly, in the second term, \( |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), pair \(1,2\) is up and down, pair \(1,3\) is up and up, pair \(2,3\) is down and up.

Third term, \( |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \), pair \(1,2\) is down and up, pair \(1,3\) is down and up, pair \(2,3\) is up and up.

So, in each term, for each pair \(i,j\), the two spins can be both up, both down, or one up and one down.

But in each term, only one spin is down. So for a particular pair \(i,j\), in each of the three terms, the spins \(i\) and \(j\) are either both up, both down, or one up and one down.

Let me tabulate the number of terms where \(i\) and \(j\) are both up, both down, or one up and one down.

Wait, for each pair \(i,j\), let's count how many terms in \( \psi \) have both \(i\) and \(j\) up, both down, or a mix.

For example, take pair \(1,2\):

First term: \( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \): both up.

Second term: \( |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): up and down.

Third term: \( |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): down and up.

So, for pair \(1,2\), in the first term, both up; in the other two terms, one up and one down.

Similarly, for pair \(1,3\):

First term: \( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \): up and down.

Second term: \( |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): up and up.

Third term: \( |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): down and up.

So, pair \(1,3\) has in first term: up and down; second term: up and up; third term: down and up.

Similarly, pair \(2,3\):

First term: \( |\uparrow_1 \uparrow_2 \downarrow_3\rangle \): up and down.

Second term: \( |\uparrow_1 \downarrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): down and up.

Third term: \( |\downarrow_1 \uparrow_2 \uparrow_3\rangle \): up and up.

So, for pair \(2,3\), first and second terms: up and down; third term: up and up.

So, for each pair, in two terms, the spins are one up and one down, and in one term, both up.

Wait, no. For pair \(1,2\):

First term: both up.

Second term: one up, one down.

Third term: one down, one up.

So, in two terms, the pair has one up and one down; in one term, both up.

Similarly for pair \(1,3\):

First term: up and down.

Second term: both up.

Third term: down and up.

Again, two terms with one up and one down, one term with both up.

Same for pair \(2,3\):

First term: up and down.

Second term: down and up.

Third term: both up.

Therefore, for each pair \(i,j\), across the three terms of \( \psi \), the number of times the pair is both up is 1, both down is 0, and the rest of the time, one up and one down.

But wait, in the case of pair \(1,2\), in the third term, it's down and up, but that's still one up and one down.

So, in each pair, across the three terms, one term has both spins up, and the other two terms have one up and one down.

Thus, for each pair \(i,j\), the expectation value \( \langle S_i \cdot S_j \rangle \) can be computed as follows.

Recall that \( S_i \cdot S_j = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} (\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j) \).

So, for two spins, the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle \) is equal to \( \langle S_i \cdot S_j \rangle / (\hbar^2 /4) \).

So, for a pair where both are up, \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1 \). Wait, no: the Pauli matrices act on individual spins, so for two spins, \( \sigma_i \) and \( \sigma_j \), the product isn't just the tensor product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, for a given state, \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \) can be written as \( \sigma_i^x \sigma_j^x + \sigma_i^y \sigma_j^y + \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z \).

So, for the basis states, like \( |\uparrow \uparrow\rangle \), \( |\uparrow \downarrow\rangle \), \( |\downarrow \uparrow\rangle \), \( |\downarrow \downarrow\rangle \), what are the eigenvalues of \( \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \)?

Let me think.

The state \( |\uparrow \uparrow\rangle \) has \( \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z = (1)(1) = 1 \). What about the x and y components?

\( \sigma_i^x |\uparrow\rangle = | \downarrow \rangle \), similarly \( \sigma_j^x |\uparrow\rangle = | \downarrow \rangle \). So, \( \sigma_i^x \sigma_j^x |\uparrow \uparrow\rangle = | \downarrow \downarrow \rangle \), which is orthogonal to \( |\uparrow \uparrow\rangle \). Similarly for the y-components.

So, for the state \( |\uparrow \uparrow\rangle \), the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle = \langle 1| (\sigma_i^x \sigma_j^x + \sigma_i^y \sigma_j^y + \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z) |1 \rangle = 1 \).

Similarly, for \( |\uparrow \downarrow\rangle \), \( \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z = (1)(-1) = -1 \). The expectation value of the x and y components would be zero because:

\( \langle \uparrow \downarrow | \sigma_i^x \sigma_j^x | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle = \langle \uparrow | \sigma_i^x | \downarrow \rangle \langle \downarrow | \sigma_j^x | \uparrow \rangle = (0)(0) = 0 \)

Similarly for the y components. So, \( \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle = -1 \) for \( |\uparrow \downarrow\rangle \).

But wait, in our state \( \psi \), each term is either both up, or one up and one down. So, for each pair \( i,j \), in one term, it's both up, giving \( \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle = 1 \), and in two terms, it's one up and one down, each with \( \langle \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j \rangle = -1 \).

Wait, but in our case, each term is a product state, so each term is a tensor product of three spins. So, for a given pair \( i,j \), in each term, \( |\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j\rangle \) can be either 1, -1, or something else?

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of \( S_i \cdot S_j \) for each term and then take the average.

But each term in \( \psi \) is an

Okay, so I've got this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as (1/√3)*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if not, what's the expectation value of E.

First, I need to recall what S1·S2 means. For spin-1/2 particles, the dot product of spin operators is S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2). But since each S_i is for a single particle, S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ². So S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2)ħ².

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute S_i·S_j directly. The expectation value of S_i·S_j in a spin state can be related to the total spin squared. So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2. Therefore, when we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), this can be rewritten as H = A*[ (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 + (1/2)(S1 + S3)^2 + (1/2)(S2 + S3)^2 - (3/2)ħ² - (3/2)ħ² - (3/2)ħ² ].

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is equal to (1/2)[(S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2] - (3/2)ħ² for each term? Maybe.

Wait, S_i·S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2/2 - S_i^2/2 - S_j^2/2. So, summing over i < j, H becomes A*(sum_{i<j} [ (S_i + S_j)^2/2 - S_i^2/2 - S_j^2/2 ]). So that would be A*( (sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 )/2 - (sum_{i<j} S_i^2 + S_j^2)/2 ).

But since in the sum over i < j, each S_i^2 appears (n-1) times, where n=3. So, for three particles, each S_i^2 appears twice (since i < j for i=1, j=2; i=1, j=3; i=2, j=3). So, sum_{i<j} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) = 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). Therefore, H can be written as A*[ (sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2)/2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)/2 ]. Wait, that would make H = A*[ (sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 )/2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ].

But maybe it's better to think about the total spin. The sum of all S_i is S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 = sum_{i<j} (S_i^2 + 2 S_i·S_j + S_j^2) = sum_{i<j} S_i^2 + sum_{i<j} S_j^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j.

But since for i < j, each S_i is summed over j > i. So sum_{i<j} S_i^2 = S1^2 * 2 (since j=2 and 3) + S2^2 *1 (since j=3), similarly S3^2 doesn't appear in the first term. Wait, maybe it's better to compute sum_{i<j} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) = sum_{i=1 to 3} sum_{j=i+1 to 3} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) = sum_{i=1 to 2} S_i^2 * (3 - i) + sum_{j=3} S_j^2 * (3 - j). Hmm, maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, since in the sum over i < j, each S_i^2 appears (3 - 1) times for i=1, (3 - 2) times for i=2, etc. Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that for each particle, S_i^2 appears in (3 - 1) terms when summed over i < j. Wait, no. Let me think: For three particles, the number of pairs where S1 appears is 2 (with S2 and S3), S2 appears in 2 pairs (with S1 and S3), and S3 appears in 2 pairs. So sum_{i<j} S_i^2 = 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). Similarly, sum_{i<j} S_j^2 = same thing, 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). So, the total sum_{i<j} (S_i^2 + S_j^2) is 4*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2). Then, sum_{i<j} (S_i + S_j)^2 = sum_{i<j} (S_i^2 + 2 S_i·S_j + S_j^2) = sum_{i<j} S_i^2 + sum_{i<j} S_j^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j = 4*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j.

But I'm not sure if this is helpful. Maybe another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of H in the given state psi. Since H is a sum of S_i·S_j terms, the expectation value can be broken down into the sum of the expectations of each S_i·S_j.

So, E = <psi| H |psi> = A * [ <psi| S1·S2 |psi> + <psi| S1·S3 |psi> + <psi| S2·S3 |psi> ]

So, if I can compute each of these expectation values, I can find E.

First, let's compute <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3>.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2) + S_i·S_j. Wait, no, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ). So, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> ).

Since each S_i is spin 1/2, <S_i^2> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

So, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - (3/4) ħ^2 - (3/4) ħ^2 )

= (1/2)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - (3/2) ħ^2 )

Now, (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i^2 + S_j^2 + 2 S_i·S_j, so perhaps that's going in circles, but perhaps another way.

Wait, but if I can find <(S_i + S_j)^2>, that'll be helpful. Let's think about what (S_i + S_j)^2 represents. It's the total spin of particles i and j. So, the possible total spins for two spin 1/2 particles are 0 and 1 (with eigenvalues 0 and 1*(1+1)ħ^2 = 2ħ^2, respectively). So, the possible eigenvalues of (S_i + S_j)^2 are 0 or 2ħ^2.

But in our state psi, each term is a product state with two up spins and one down. Let me write down the state psi:

psi = (1/√3)[ ↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑ ]

Let me note that each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, in each term, the total spin of any two particles can be zero or one. Let me think about each term.

Wait, but since the state is symmetric under permutation of particles, perhaps I can compute <(S_i + S_j)^2> for any pair (i,j), and it will be the same for all pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_i·S_j> directly.

Wait, perhaps computing <S_i·S_j> as the expectation value in the state psi.

Since S_i and S_j are spin operators, their expectation values can be found in the state. But since the state is a sum of product states, we can expand the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the state is symmetric under permutation, so the expectation value for any pair (i,j) will be the same. So, let's compute <S1·S2> and then multiply by 3, since there are three such terms in H.

Wait, no. Actually, H has three terms: S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3, each multiplied by A. So, the expectation value of H is A*(3 * <S1·S2>), if all <S_i·S_j> are equal.

Wait, is that the case? Let's check if <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>.

But in our state psi, each particle is in a product state with two up spins and one down. So, for any two particles, the spin-up and spin-up might have a certain correlation, and spin-up and spin-down might have another.

Alternatively, maybe all the cross terms in the expectation value will be the same.

But perhaps I should compute <S1·S2> first.

So, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Using the property that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4) ħ^2 - (3/4) ħ^2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/2) ħ^2.

Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me correct that. S_i·S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2], so <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> )

Since each <S_i^2> is (3/4) ħ^2, as we said earlier.

So, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - 3/2 ħ^2 )

So, if I can compute <(S1 + S2)^2>, then I can find <S1·S2>.

Now, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>

But this seems circular because we're trying to find <S1·S2> using <(S1 + S2)^2>.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the state is a symmetric combination, I can perhaps find the eigenvalues of the total spin operators.

Wait, but the state psi is a symmetric state under permutation, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total^2, the total spin squared.

Wait, let's check what the state looks like. It's a symmetric state where each term has exactly two up spins and one down spin, which suggests that the total spin could be 1/2. But wait, let me think.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi here has two up and one down, which is symmetric under permutation. Let me compute the total spin squared, S_total^2, in the state psi.

The eigenvalues of S_total^2 are S(S+1)ħ^2, where S is the total spin, so 3/2 or 1/2.

If the state is symmetric and has two up and one down, maybe it's in the S=1/2 subspace.

Wait, let me compute S_total^2 acting on the state psi.

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, if we can find <psi|S_total^2|psi>, that would be <psi| S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi>

But since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ^2, their sum is 3*(3/4) ħ^2 = (9/4) ħ^2.

So, <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ^2 + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>

But from H, we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so <H> = A * <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = A * [ <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ].

Wait, but maybe we can relate <S_total^2> and <H>.

Wait, from S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, <S_total^2> = 3*(3/4 ħ^2) + 2*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

But H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so let's denote E = <H> = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

Then, <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ^2 + 2*(E / A)

Wait, but we can also compute <S_total^2> by acting on psi and finding its eigenvalue.

Since the state psi is symmetric, it's an eigenstate of S_total^2.

So, what's the eigenvalue? Let me consider that the state has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin could be 1/2.

The eigenvalue would then be S(S+1) ħ^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, so if <S_total^2> = (3/4) ħ^2, then:

(3/4) ħ^2 = (9/4) ħ^2 + 2*(E / A)

So, solving for E:

2*(E / A) = (3/4) ħ^2 - (9/4) ħ^2 = (-6/4) ħ^2 = (-3/2) ħ^2

So, E / A = (-3/4) ħ^2

Thus, E = A * (-3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, but that contradicts the given correct answer, which is expectation value 3/4 A ħ^2. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

If S_total^2 acting on psi gives (3/4) ħ^2 * psi, then:

<S_total^2> = (3/4) ħ^2

On the other hand, <S_total^2> = sum_{i=1 to 3} <S_i^2> + 2 sum_{i<j} <S_i·S_j>

Which is 3*(3/4) ħ^2 + 2(A^{-1
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this problem here about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if not, what the expectation value of E is. The answer is supposed to be that it's not an eigenstate, and the expectation value is (3/4)*A*hbar². Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are vectors for each particle. The dot product S1·S2 is essentially the scalar product of the spin vectors of particles 1 and 2. I think in terms of expectation values, when computing the expectation value of H, I need to compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term.

Since the state psi is a symmetric combination, maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit here. Let me write down the state again:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So each term has two up spins and one down spin. This is a symmetric state under permutation of particles, right? Because swapping any two particles doesn't change the state. So this might be an eigenstate of some symmetric operator, perhaps the total spin squared operator or the total spin operator.

Wait, but H is not just the total spin squared, because S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is equal to (S1 + S2 + S3)² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) all over 2. Let me verify that:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So rearranging that, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²)] / 2

Yes, that seems right. So H can be written as A times that expression. So H = A/2 * [ (S_total)^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ]

Since S1, S2, S3 are spin-1/2 particles, each S_i² = (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

So H = A/2 [ S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ]

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total² - (9/8) A ħ²

So if I can find the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi, then I can compute the expectation value of H.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 individually and sum them up.

But maybe working through S_total² is more straightforward because of the symmetry of the state.

Given that the state is symmetric under permutation, and has two up spins and one down spin, it's actually a state with total spin S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

Wait, but S_total² is an operator, and its eigenvalues are S(S+1)ħ². So the eigenvalues depend on the total spin S of the state. So if I can find the total spin S of the state psi, then I can compute S_total² and hence compute H.

But wait, is psi an eigenstate of S_total²? Let me think.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. What's the total spin of each term? For a spin-1/2 particle, each up spin can be thought of as +1/2 and down as -1/2, so the total spin in each term is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. Wait, no, that's for each individual term. But S_total is the sum of all three spins.

Wait, let me think in terms of the total spin squared.

In quantum mechanics, the total spin squared operator is S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So if I can find the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi, I can then relate that to the expectation value of H.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to first calculate the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term.

But perhaps working with the total spin is better because of the symmetry.

So let's consider the state psi. It is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, as we noted earlier.

Therefore, the state is an eigenstate of the permutation operators, which might imply that it has a well-defined total spin.

But wait, each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. So in each term, the z-component of total spin is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. But that's just the z-component, not the total spin.

The total spin S can have different possible values. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me recall: when combining three spins, the total spin can range from 3/2 down to 1/2 in integer steps.

Given that psi has two up and one down, perhaps it's a state with total spin S = 1/2.

Wait, is that the case? Let me try to figure that out.

To find the eigenvalue of S_total², we can use the fact that if the state is an eigenstate of S_total², then the expectation value of S_total² is S(S+1)ħ².

But to do that, we need to compute ⟨psi| S_total² |psi⟩.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the state has two up and one down, and compute the total spin squared operator in terms of the number of up and down spins.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to note that for three spin-1/2 particles, when combined, their total spin can be either 3/2 or 1/2.

But what's the multiplicity of each? For three spin-1/2, the possible total spin S can be 3/2 (with multiplicity 3) or 1/2 (with multiplicity 6). Wait, no, that's not right. The number of states for each total spin is given by (2S + 1) times the number of ways to combine, but actually, the multiplicity is different.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of states with different total spins. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2. The number of states with S = 3/2 is 3 (since the number is 3 for S=3/2 and 6 for S=1/2). Wait, no, actually the number of states for each S is given by the number of possible ways to combine the spins. The total number of states is 2^3 = 8. The number of states with S=3/2 is 3 (since the triplet states are three), and the number of states with S=1/2 is 5 (since the singlet state is one and the triplet state is three, but wait, no. Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can't be 1; it can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, you get spin 1 and spin 0. For three spin-1/2 particles, I think the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Let me recall:

When combining three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are:

- 3/2: which can be formed by combining two spins into a spin-1, then combining with the third spin-1/2. The number of such states is 3 (since the spin-1 can combine with spin-1/2 in 3 ways).

- 1/2: which can be formed by combining two spins into spin-1, and then combining with spin-1/2 in a way that gives total spin 1/2. The number of such states is 6? Wait, actually, for each of the three possible ways to leave out one spin, you can form a spin-1 and spin-1/2 state, and there are three possibilities. Each spin-1 and spin-1/2 combination can form spin-3/2 or spin-1/2. So for each of the three, you have 2 possible S_total: 3/2 and 1/2.

But since the total number of states is 8, and the number of spin-3/2 states is 3, the remaining 5 must be spin-1/2 states.

Wait, no. Wait, when you combine three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can only be 3/2 or 1/2, right? Because if you combine spin-1/2 and spin-1/2, you can get spin 1 or spin 0. Then combining with a third spin-1/2. So combining a spin-1 with spin-1/2 gives spin-3/2 or spin-1/2. Similarly, combining spin-0 with spin-1/2 gives spin-1/2.

So the total spin is either 3/2 (when you have spin-1 combined with spin-1/2) or 1/2 (when you have either spin-0 or spin-1 combined with spin-1/2). So the number of spin-3/2 states is 3 (since each pair can choose one to combine with the third, giving 3 different states). The rest, which are 5, are spin-1/2 states.

So, in the state psi, which is a symmetric combination of three states each with two up and one down, does it correspond to a spin-1/2 state?

Well, let's see: the state psi is symmetric under permutation, so it must be an eigenstate of S_total². If it's a spin-1/2 state, then S_total² would have eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

So let's check that.

First, let's compute S_total². But computing S_total² directly can be a bit involved. Instead, maybe I can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), the expectation value of H is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

So perhaps I can compute each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩.

Since the state is symmetric, I can compute, say, ⟨S1·S2⟩ once and it will be the same as ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩, right? Because the state is symmetric under permutation of particles.

So, for a given pair (i,j), what is ⟨S_i·S_j⟩?

The operator S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i² + S_j²)

So ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ - (1/2)(⟨S_i²⟩ + ⟨S_j²⟩)

We know that ⟨S_i²⟩ = (3/4)ħ² for each particle.

So ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/2)⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ - (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) = (1/2)⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ - (3/4)ħ²

So if I can find ⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩, I can compute ⟨S_i·S_j⟩.

Now, (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i² + 2 S_i·S_j + S_j²

Wait, but that's the same as S_i·S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ] / 2, which is the same as above.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of (S_i + S_j)² as the square of the total spin for particles i and j. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe express (S_i + S_j)^2 = S_i² + S_j² + 2 S_i·S_j, which we already have.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute ⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ in terms of the possible states.

So let's fix particles 1 and 2, and compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩.

In the state psi, each term is a product of spins, so let's evaluate ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ for each term in psi.

But wait, since the state is a sum of three terms, I can compute the expectation value by projecting each term onto the state.

Wait, but the state is normalized, so perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value by expanding the operator S1 + S2 in the basis of the state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps use the properties of spin states.

Wait, note that (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = ⟨S1²⟩ + ⟨S2²⟩ + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩.

But we already know ⟨S1²⟩ and ⟨S2²⟩, which are both 3/4 ħ².

So, that gives:

⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (3/2)ħ² + 2 ⟨S1·S2⟩.

So that means, from this equation, we can solve for ⟨S1·S2⟩:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 3/2 ħ² ] / 2

But this seems circular unless we can compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ another way.

Wait, but perhaps in the state psi, which is symmetric, I can compute ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ by looking at the action of the operator on the state psi.

Wait, the operator (S1 + S2) acts on each term in psi. Let me write down psi and see what (S1 + S2) does.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the total spin S1 + S2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the state psi is symmetric, maybe we can think of it as a state with a certain total spin. If it's a spin-1/2 state, then the total spin squared is (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(sum S_i·S_j)

So from H, we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So,

H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) = A*( (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 )

Hence, if S_total² |psi> = S(S+1) ħ² |psi>, then:

⟨H⟩ = A/2 [ S(S+1) ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ]

Therefore, if I can find S(S+1) ħ², I can compute ⟨H⟩.

So the key is to find the total spin S of the state psi.

Given that psi is symmetric, perhaps it's an eigenstate of S_total². If so, then we can compute the expectation value of S_total², and hence find S.

So, how can I compute ⟨S_total²⟩?

Well, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already know S1² + S2² + S3² = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 2⟨sum S_i·S_j⟩

But sum S_i·S_j is part of H. So,

⟨H⟩ = A ⟨sum S_i·S_j⟩ = A [ (⟨S_total²⟩ - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ]

So if I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩ directly by considering the action of the operator on the state psi
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The spin state is given as psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H and find its energy or expectation value if it's not.

First, let me recall that the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z). This expression is symmetric in spin indices, so for three particles, the Hamiltonian is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

Given that, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). I wonder if this can be rewritten in terms of the total spin squared operator. I remember that for two particles, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Extending this idea, for three particles, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, in that case, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be expressed as A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ). Since each S_i^2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², because each spin is 1/2. So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ). So, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ).

Thus, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the given state psi, I can compute the energy.

Now, what is the total spin S_total for the state psi? Let me look at the state psi: it is a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down.

Wait, no, actually, each term is up up down, up down up, down up up. So, each term has two up spins and one down spin, but in different positions. So, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2? Hmm.

Wait, let me think. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are 3/2 (triplet states) and 1/2 (singlet states). The given state psi is a symmetric combination of states with two ups and one down. How many such states are there?

Each particle can be either up or down. The number of states with two ups and one down is C(3,1) = 3. So, in total, three states. The state psi is a symmetric combination of these three, each multiplied by 1/sqrt(3).

I need to figure out the total spin of this state. Let me try to find the total S^2 operator acting on psi.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H directly. Let me see.

Since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, let me compute <H> = (A/2) <psi| S_total^2 |psi> - (A/2)(9/4 ħ²).

So, first, I need to find <S_total^2> for the state psi. If I can find that, then I can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps I can note that the state psi is a symmetric state under permutation of spins. So, perhaps it's in a particular spin multiplet. Let me try to see.

Wait, each term in psi is a state with two spins up and one spin down. So, perhaps this is a state from the 3/2 multiplet. Because in the 3/2 multiplet, we have symmetric states with two spins up and one down, etc.

But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, let's consider the singlet and triplet states. For three spin 1/2 particles, the singlet state has total spin S = 0, and the triplet states have S = 1/2 and S = 3/2? Wait, no, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S = 1/2 and S = 3/2, because the addition of three 1/2 spins can lead to either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, actually, for two spin 1/2 particles, the total spin is either 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). For three spin 1/2 particles, it's a bit more involved. Let me recall that three spin 1/2 particles can combine to form a spin 3/2 state (which is a quartet) and a spin 1/2 state (which is a doublet). So, the possible total spins are S=3/2 (quartet) and S=1/2 (doublet).

Therefore, the state psi, which is a symmetric combination of three states with two ups and one down, is part of the triplet S=1/2 or the quartet S=3/2?

Wait, let me think again. In the quartet (S=3/2), the states can have S_z values of 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. Each of these states is a symmetric combination. For example, the S_z=3/2 state is |up up up>. S_z=1/2 states would have two ups and one down, but arranged in a way that's symmetric. Similarly, S_z=-1/2 would have two downs and one up, and S_z=-3/2 is |down down down>.

Similarly, in the doublet (S=1/2), the states have S_z=1/2 and -1/2. The S_z=1/2 state is |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>, which is symmetric, and S_z=-1/2 is |down down up> + |down up down> + |up down down>, which is also symmetric.

Wait, so that's actually the same as our state psi. Our state psi is the S_z=1/2 state of the doublet (S=1/2), because it's the sum of the three states where two spins are up and one is down.

Therefore, our state psi is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue 1/2, and also an eigenstate of S^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, S_total^2 |psi> = (3/4)ħ² |psi>, so <S_total^2> = 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, plugging back into H, we have <H> = (A/2)( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ² ). So, substituting, <H> = (A/2)( (3/4 ħ²) - (9/4 ħ²) ) = (A/2)( (-6/4)ħ² ) = (A/2)( -3/2 ħ² ) = -3A/4 ħ².

Wait, but the user says the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check. If the state psi is in the doublet with S=1/2, then S_total^2 |psi> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² |psi> = (3/4) ħ² |psi>. So, S_total^2 is 3/4 ħ².

Then, H = (A/2)( S_total^2 - (9/4) ħ² ). So, <H> = (A/2)( 3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)( -6/4 ħ² ) = - (3/4) A ħ².

But the user's answer is 3/4 A ħ². So, perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [ S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2.

Thus, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [ S_total² - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2 ). So that seems correct.

Therefore, if S_total^2 is (3/4) ħ², then substituting gives [ (3/4) - 9/4 ] = -6/4 = -3/2, so H = (A/2)( -3/2 ) ħ² = -3A/4 ħ².

But the user says expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². So, either I made a mistake or perhaps the state is in the opposite multiplet.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the multiplet is wrong. Let me check. If the state psi is symmetric, it could be either in the quartet S=3/2 or the doublet S=1/2.

Wait, the doublet has S=1/2 with states of S_z=1/2 and -1/2, and the quartet has S=3/2 with S_z=3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Given that psi is symmetric and has two up spins and one down, but in all possible positions, which is the same as the S_z=1/2 state of the doublet, that should have S=1/2. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the action of S_total^2 on this state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> directly.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, S_total^2 = (3*(3/4) ħ²) + 2*(H/A).

Wait, because H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + ... = H/A. Therefore, S_total^2 = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(H/A). So, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²). That is the same as I had before.

Therefore, to compute H acting on psi, or the expectation value, we can use:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²). So, for state psi, which is in the doublet with S=1/2, <S_total^2> = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². Therefore:

<H> = (A/2)( (3/4) ħ² - (9/4) ħ² ) = (A/2)( -6/4 ħ² ) = - (3/4) A ħ².

Hmm, that's negative, but the user's answer is positive. So, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the state is not in the doublet, but in the quartet. Let me think again.

Wait, if psi is symmetric and consists of all states with two up and one down, that is similar to the S_z=1/2 state in the quartet. Wait, no, in the quartet, the S_z=1/2 state is not simply all two up and one down. It is a symmetric combination, but with specific coefficients.

Wait, let me recall that in the quartet, the S_z=1/2 state is a symmetric combination of three states: |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>, which is exactly our state psi. So, in that case, psi is part of the quartet with S=3/2.

Wait, that would mean that S_total^2 |psi> = (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ² |psi> = (15/4) ħ² |psi>. Then, plugging back into H:

<H> = (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(6/4 ħ² ) = (3/4) A ħ².

Which is the result the user states.

Wait, so I think I confused the multiplet before. So, actually, psi is in the quartet S=3/2 because it's a symmetric combination with two up and one down, which is the S_z=1/2 state of the quartet.

So, my earlier assumption was wrong because I thought it was in the doublet, but actually, since it's symmetric, it's in the quartet.

Therefore, the correct <S_total^2> is 15/4 ħ², so the expectation value of H is (A/2)(15/4 - 9/4 ) ħ² = (A/2)(6/4) ħ² = (3/4) A ħ².

So, that's why the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². So, to conclude, psi is an eigenstate of H, with energy 3/4 A ħ².

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. If psi is in the quartet, then its S_total^2 eigenvalue is indeed 15/4 ħ², so H acting on it gives the expectation value as above.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute H psi directly.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can think of H as the sum of pairwise interactions, so sum over S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

If I compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j separately.

So, for S1·S2, which is (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

So, let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2. Since the state is symmetric in particles 1,2,3, the expectation value of S1·S2 should be the same as S1·S3 and S2·S3.

So, 3 times the expectation value of S1·S2 would be the total expectation value of H, so 3 <S1·S2>.

So, first, compute <S1·S2>.

Expressed in terms of spins, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Since the state is |psi> = 1/sqrt(3) [ |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ].

So, let me write |up> as |↑> and |down> as |↓>, for simplicity.

Then, S1^z |↑> = (1/2) |↑>, and S1^z |↓> = (-1/2) |↓>.

So, let's compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>.

Since S1·S2 is the same for each pair, the expectation value can be computed as follows.

Note that for each term in |psi>, it's a product state of spins.

So, the state |psi> is a sum of |a b c>, where exactly two are up and one is down.

Let me consider each term in |psi> as |a b c>, and the inner product <a b c| with S1·S2 |a b c>.

But since S1·S2 acts on the first and second particles, leaving the third particle's spin unchanged.

Thus, for a given |a b c>, S1·S2 |a b c> = (1/2)( a b (a·b) c ), where a·b is the dot product of the first two spins.

Wait, more accurately, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

So, if a and b are up or down, then S1^z|a> = (1/2) a, so S1^z S2^z |a b>
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian H, and a given spin state psi. I need to figure out if psi is an eigenfunction of H and, if it is, find its energy. If not, compute the expectation value of E. The answer is supposed to be that it's not an eigenstate, but the expectation value is 3/4 * A * ħ². Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me write down the given information to make sure I have everything clear.

The Hamiltonian H is given by:
H = A * (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Where A is a constant, and Si are the spin operators for each particle.

The spin state psi is:
psi = 1/sqrt(3) * ( |↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩ )

So, psi is a symmetric state under permutations of the particles, but each term has two spins up and one spin down. Interesting.

I need to check if psi is an eigenstate of H. If not, compute ⟨H⟩.

First, I should recall some properties of spin operators. The dot product of spin operators, like S_i·S_j, can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared minus the individual spins squared.

Wait, right, the identity is:

S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i² + S_j² - S_total²)

But in this case, the Hamiltonian is a sum of three such terms: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, maybe I can express H in terms of the total spin squared.

Let's compute H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

I can write each term as (1/2)(S_i² + S_j² - S_total²), but wait, S_total is the sum of all three spins, S1 + S2 + S3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

I remember that the sum of all pairwise dot products can be related to the total spin squared. Let me recall the formula.

In general, for three spins, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 equals ( S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3² ) ) / 2

Yes, that seems right. Let me verify.

We know that:
( S1 + S2 + S3 )² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, from this, we can solve for the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Rearranging the equation:

2( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = ( S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3² )

Therefore:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = ( S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3² ) / 2

But each spin is 1/2, so S1² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, the sum of S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

So, substituting back into H:

H = A * [ ( S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 ]

Wait, so H can be written as:

H = (A/2) * ( S_total² - (9/4)ħ² )

That's a useful expression because if psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then H will act on it by scaling with this factor. So, let's check if psi is an eigenstate of S_total².

S_total² is (S1 + S2 + S3)², which expands to S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But since we have H expressed in terms of S_total², and if psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then H will just multiply psi by some constant, making it an eigenstate of H.

So, I need to find the eigenvalue of S_total² for psi.

To do that, let's first compute S_total² acting on psi.

But maybe it's easier to first compute the total spin squared for this state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total spin S_total squared for this state. Let me recall that for a given state, the eigenvalue of S_total² is s(s+1)ħ² where s is the total spin quantum number. So, if the state is in a multiplet with total spin s, then S_total² |psi> = s(s+1)ħ² |psi>.

So, to find s, I need to find the possible total spin of this state.

Given that each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down, the possible total spin can be either 1 or 2? Wait, no. Let me think about it.

Each spin is 1/2, so the possible total spin s can be 3/2 or 1/2. Because with three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Our state psi has two spins up and one spin down. Let's see if this corresponds to a singlet or a triplet.

Wait, actually, in three particles, the singlet and triplet are for two particles. For three particles, the spin states are more complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the possible total spins for each term in the superposition.

Each term is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Each such term is a state with two up spins and one down spin.

What is the total spin of such a state?

Let me think about it. For a single term, say |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, how do I figure that out?

Well, for each term, we can compute S_total². Let me compute S_total² for a single term, say |↑↑↓⟩.

First, compute S1, S2, S3 in the z-basis.

But perhaps another approach is to note that for a state with m=1/2, 3/2, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the action of S_total² on |↑↑↓⟩.

For a state |↑↑↓⟩, what is the action of S_total²?

Let me recall that S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding this, we have:

S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, for a given state, S_total² |ψ⟩ = [S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |ψ⟩

We already know that S1², S2², S3² each act on |ψ⟩ as (3/4)ħ² times the state, because (S_i)² is (s(s+1))ħ², and for spin 1/2, s=1/2, so (1/2)(1/2 +1)= 3/4.

So, S1² |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, same for S2² and S3².

Therefore, the first part of S_total² is (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Now, the second part is 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, let me compute S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 for |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

Each S_i is the spin operator, so S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z)

For the state |↑↑↓⟩, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

First, S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩, same for S2_z |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1_z S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, what about S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y?

Remember that for spin 1/2, S_x = (1/2)( |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ), but actually, S_x has components, and S_x |↑⟩ = (1/2) |↓⟩, S_x |↓⟩ = (1/2) |↑⟩.

Wait, actually, to compute S1_x S2_x, which acts on both spins 1 and 2.

Similarly for S1_y S2_y.

So, let's compute S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩:

First, S1_x |↑⟩ = (1/2) |↓⟩, S2_x |↑⟩ = (1/2) |↓⟩.

So, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↓⟩ (1/2)|↓⟩ |↓⟩ = (1/4) |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1_y S2_y |↑↑↓⟩.

S1_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩, S2_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩.

So, S1_y S2_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i/2)(i/2)|↓↓↓⟩ = (-1/4) |↓↓↓⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4)|↓↓↓⟩, and S1_y S2_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)|↓↓↓⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y = (1/4 - 1/4)|↓↓↓⟩ = 0.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ( S1_z S2_z + S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y ) |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩ + 0 = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, let's compute S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

This is (S1_z S3_z + S1_x S3_x + S1_y S3_y) |↑↑↓⟩.

S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩, S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2)ħ |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1_z S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, S1_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩: S1_x |↑⟩ = (1/2)|↓⟩, S3_x |↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩.

So, S1_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↓⟩ (1/2)|↑⟩ |↑⟩ = (1/4) |↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, S1_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩: S1_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩, S3_y |↓⟩ = (i/2)|↑⟩.

So, S1_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i/2)(i/2)|↓↑↑⟩ = (-1/4)|↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1_x S3_x + S1_y S3_y = (1/4)|↓↑↑⟩ + (-1/4)|↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

So, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + 0 = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, let's compute S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩.

S2_z S3_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

S2_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩: S2_x |↑⟩ = (1/2)|↓⟩, S3_x |↓⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩.

So, S2_x S3_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)|↓⟩ (1/2)|↑⟩ |↓⟩ = (1/4)|↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩: S2_y |↑⟩ = (i/2)|↓⟩, S3_y |↓⟩ = (i/2)|↑⟩.

So, S2_y S3_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (i/2)(i/2)|↓↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)|↓↑↓⟩.

Thus, S2_x S3_x + S2_y S3_y = (1/4)|↓↑↓⟩ + (-1/4)|↓↑↓⟩ = 0.

So, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + 0 = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, putting it all together:

S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

So, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is:

(1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩

S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Thus, adding them up:

(1/4) |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4)ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Wait, but S1·S2 is scalar, so S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩, which is (1/4)(ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩?

Wait, no, I think I confused units. The spin operators S_i have units of ħ, so S1·S2 is in units of ħ².

But when I computed S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩, the result was (1/4) |↑↑↓⟩, but in terms of units, that would be (1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩, right? Because S1·S2 has units of ħ².

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S1·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩

Same for S2·S3 |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Therefore, adding them:

(1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

So, 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩ = 2*(-1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/2) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, hold on, I think I messed up a factor somewhere.

Wait, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S1·S2) |↑↑↓⟩ + (S1·S3) |↑↑↓⟩ + (S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is (1/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ + (-1/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ = (-1/4 -1/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩? Wait, no.

Wait, each term is S1·S2 |↑↑
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about spin 1/2 particles. It's kind of a system with three particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H equals A times the sum of the dot products of their spin operators. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). A is a constant, and each Si is the spin operator for particle i. 

The state is given as psi, which is a normalized vector. It's 1 over square root of 3 times three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. So each term has two spins up and one spin down. Interesting.

The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, we need to find its energy. If not, find the expectation value of the energy. The correct answer is that it's not an eigenstate, and the expectation value is (3/4)*A*hbar squared. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall some properties of spin operators. For spin 1/2 particles, each spin operator S_i has components that can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. But maybe more useful here is the fact that the sum of spin operators squared can be related to the total spin. Specifically, I remember that for each pair of spin operators, S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{total}^2), but that might be for the total spin. Wait, actually, more accurately, S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2), where S_{i+j} is the total spin of particles i and j.

Given that, maybe I can rewrite H in terms of the total spin. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2) + (1/2)(S1^2 + S3^2 - S_{13}^2) + (1/2)(S2^2 + S3^2 - S_{23}^2) ). 

But that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the total spin of all three particles, S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, we have that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all over 2. So, H = A*( (S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ) / 2.

Since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ². Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = (9/4)ħ².

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = ( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2.

Thus, H = A*( ( (S_total)^2 - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 ). 

But what is the state psi? Let me analyze the state psi. It's a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let me write it out:

psi = (1/sqrt(3))( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Hmm, so it's symmetric under permutation of particles. Therefore, this state is symmetric. What is the total spin of this state?

Wait, each term in the sum has two spins up and one spin down, so the total spin Sz can be calculated as (1/2)*2 - (1/2)*1 = 1/2. So, each term has Sz = 1/2. So, the total Sz for the state psi is 1/2.

But what about the total spin squared, S_total^2? That depends on the multiplicity. Since the state is symmetric, maybe it's a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be 3/2 or 1/2. So, the state psi can have total spin S_total = 1/2 or 3/2.

But given that the state is symmetric, it can't be a singlet because singlet is antisymmetric. So, the state must have total spin 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, to figure out whether it's 3/2 or 1/2, let's think about the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition. Starting from two spins up, combining with a third spin down.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the action of S_total^2 on the state psi.

But perhaps an easier approach is to calculate the expectation value of H. Since the problem is asking for the expectation value, maybe I don't need to know if it's an eigenstate or not. But wait, the correct answer says it's not an eigenstate, so perhaps I need to see whether H acting on psi gives a multiple of psi or not.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value directly.

Given that, let me recall that the expectation value of H is <psi| H |psi> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

So, perhaps I can compute <S_i·S_j> for each pair.

Since S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_{i+j}^2), so <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(<S_i^2> + <S_j^2> - <S_{i+j}^2>).

Compute each term.

First, since each S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ², so <S_i^2> = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² - <S_{i+j}^2> ) = (1/2)( (3/2)ħ² - <S_{i+j}^2> ) = (3/4)ħ² - (1/2)<S_{i+j}^2>.

So, I need to compute <S_{i+j}^2> for each pair. So, for each pair, like S1·S2, what's the expectation value of S_{1+2}^2?

To find <S_{i+j}^2>, which is the expectation value of the square of the total spin of particles i and j.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S_{i+j} can be either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So, the possible values are 0 and 1.

But wait, in this case, the state psi is a symmetric combination. Let's think about a specific pair, say particles 1 and 2. So, in the state psi, the spins of particles 1 and 2 can be up-up, up-down, or down-up. Similarly, but the third particle is down, up, or up accordingly.

So, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_{12}^2 for the state psi.

So, S_{12}^2 is (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

So, <S_{12}^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>.

But we already know that <S1·S2> is part of what we're calculating. Alternatively, another approach is that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_{12}^2 is (S_{12} (S_{12} + 1)) ħ². For two spin 1/2 particles, S_{12} can be 0 or 1, so S_{12}(S_{12} + 1) is either 0 or 2.

Wait, but the state psi is symmetric, so maybe it's a triplet? Because the singlet is antisymmetric. So, if the state is symmetric, it must be a triplet, so S_{12} = 1 for each pair?

Wait, no, because each individual pair may or may not be in a triplet or singlet. Hmm, perhaps I need to be more precise.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value by considering all possible states.

Wait, another idea: Let me write out the state psi as a linear combination of basis states.

Each basis state is a product of spin states for each particle. So, for three particles, each in spin up or down, there are 2^3 = 8 basis states.

psi is a symmetric combination of three states: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. So, it's symmetric under permutation.

So, to compute <S1·S2>, I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state psi.

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2).

But since S1^2 and S2^2 are both (3/4)ħ², as each spin is 1/2. So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² - <S_{12}^2>) = (3/4 ħ² - (1/2) <S_{12}^2>).

So, if I can compute <S_{12}^2>, I can find <S1·S2>.

Similarly, to compute <S_{12}^2>, I can note that for two spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1). 

In the state psi, particles 1 and 2 are in a state that can be either |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩. However, in each term of the psi, particle 3 is also in a specific state.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to write down the density matrix for particles 1 and 2, and compute <S_{12}^2> from that.

But perhaps we can compute it by considering the action of S_{12}^2 on the state psi.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that in the state psi, the spins of particles 1 and 2 can be up-up, up-down, or down-up.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the expectation value <S_{12}^2> as follows:

First, for each term in psi, I can compute the expectation value.

Wait, since psi is a symmetric combination, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value as the average over all possible states.

Wait, let's try that.

The state psi is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3).

So, the probability of each basis state is 1/3.

So, for each basis state, I can compute <S_{12}^2>.

For |↑↑↓⟩: S1 = up, S2 = up, S3 = down.

So, S1·S2 for this state is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² for spin 1 and spin 2? Wait, no, S1·S2 is (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

In the |↑↑⟩ state, each spin is up, so S1_x S2_x is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ²? Wait, no. Actually, S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|→⟩, but maybe I should think in terms of expectation values.

Wait, in the |↑↑⟩ state, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ². Because for two spin-up particles, S1·S2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 - S_{12}^2)/2, so in |↑↑⟩, S1·S2 = ( (3/4 + 3/4 - S_{12}^2 ) ) * ħ² / 2. But S_{12}^2 can be 0 or 1*(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ².

Wait, but in |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet (S=1), so S_{12}^2 = 1*(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 = (3/4 + 3/4 - 2) * ħ² / 2 = (1.5 - 2) * ħ² / 2 = (-0.5) * ħ² / 2 = -0.25 ħ².

Wait, but in the state |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↑⟩. So, the expectation value of S1·S2 is -0.25 ħ².

Similarly, for the |↑↓⟩ state, which is part of the triplet and singlet. Wait, |↑↓⟩ has S_{12}^2 = 0 * (0 + 1) + 1*(1 + 1) = same as before, but S_{12}^2 for |↑↓⟩ is ( (S1 + S2)^2 ), which is (S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2). So, for |↑↓⟩, S1·S2 is ( (3/4 + 3/4 - S_{12}^2 ) ) * ħ² / 2.

But wait, in |↑↓⟩, the total spin is 0, so S_{12}^2 = 0(0 + 1)ħ² = 0. Therefore, S1·S2 = (3/4 + 3/4 - 0)/2 * ħ² = (1.5)/2 * ħ² = 0.75 ħ².

But wait, that can't be because in |↑↓⟩, S1·S2 is 0. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the operator and expectation value. Let me think clearly.

Actually, for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_{12}^2 is (S(S+1))ħ².

In the triplet state (S=1), S_{12}^2 = 2ħ², as I said earlier.

In the singlet state (S=0), S_{12}^2 = 0.

Therefore, for each term in the state psi:

- In |↑↑↓⟩, particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↑⟩, which is part of the triplet, so S_{12}^2 = 2ħ².

- In |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↓⟩, which is part of the singlet, so S_{12}^2 = 0ħ².

- In |↓↑↑⟩, same as |↑↓↑⟩, particles 1 and 2 are in |↓↑⟩, which is part of the singlet, so S_{12}^2 = 0ħ².

But wait, actually, when particles 1 and 2 are in |↑↓⟩ or |↓↑⟩, the state is symmetric, which is part of the triplet. Wait, hold on. Wait, no: |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are part of the triplet? Or the singlet?

Wait, the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), which is antisymmetric. The triplet has three states: (|↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩).

Wait, so |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are both part of the triplet, with S=1. So, in that case, for |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩, S_{12}^2 = 2ħ².

But wait, that seems contradictory. Because in the case of |↑↑⟩, it's part of the triplet, S_{12}^2=2ħ².

But |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are also part of the triplet, so they should have S_{12}^2=2ħ² as well.

But wait, when we compute the expectation value of S_{12}^2 in |↑↓⟩, we get 2ħ².

Wait, so in the state |↑↑↓⟩, S_{12}^2 is 2ħ².

In the state |↑↓↑⟩, S_{12}^2 is 2ħ² as well? Because |↑↓⟩ is part of the triplet, so S_{12}^2 is 2ħ².

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it explicitly.

Given that S_{12}^2 is the square of the total spin operator. For |↑↓⟩, S1·S2 is ( (S1_z S2_z) + (S1_x S2_x + i S1_y S2_y) + (S1_x S2_y - i S1_y S2_x) ) /

Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if not, to find the expectation value of E.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem. We have three spin-1/2 particles, each can be either spin-up or spin-down. The Hamiltonian is a sum of the dot products of each pair of spins, multiplied by a constant A. So, H is proportional to the sum of the pairwise spin interactions.

The state psi is given as a symmetric combination of states where two spins are up and one is down. Specifically, each term in the sum has two up spins and one down spin. The coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3), so it's an equally weighted combination of these three states. So, psi is a spin state with two up and one down, arranged in such a way that each particle is up in two of the three terms and down in one.

Now, is this state an eigenfunction of H? If it is, its energy would be the expectation value of H. If not, we need to compute the expectation value.

Let me recall that for spin systems, eigenstates of the total spin squared operator S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² can be helpful. But our Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), which is equal to A*( (S1 + S2 + S3)² - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ) / 2. Since each S_i² is (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2 particles.

So, let's compute H in terms of S_total² and S_total_z.

First, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore,

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²)) / 2 )

Since S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ², the sum S1² + S2² + S3² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore,

H = A*( (S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ) / 2 ) = (A/2) S_total² - (9A/8) ħ².

So, H can be written as a linear combination of S_total squared and a constant term.

Now, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then it will also be an eigenstate of H because H is written in terms of S_total².

So, let's find the eigenvalue of S_total² for the state psi.

In the case of three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can have spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. Let me recall that when adding three spin 1/2 particles, you can have total spin S = 3/2 (which arises when all three are aligned) or S = 1/2. Since in our state, we have two spins up and one down, this suggests that the total spin might be 1/2 because it's a symmetric combination, but let me check that.

Wait, actually, the state psi is a specific combination of states with two up and one down. Let's see whether it corresponds to an eigenstate of S_total².

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_total² in this state and see if it's a single value.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of H directly. Since H is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), maybe I can compute the expectation value of each term and sum them up.

Let me note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+). But for expectation values, maybe it's easier to use the identity involving spin states. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that S_i·S_j = (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 all over 2.

Wait, that's similar to what I did before. But maybe another approach is to compute S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately, then sum them up.

Given that the state is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩), let's compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3.

But first, perhaps it would help to note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+). So, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is (1/2)(⟨ψ|S_i^+ S_j^- |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S_i^- S_j^+ |ψ⟩ ). But this might become complicated because of the non-diagonal terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of the total spin.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let me compute the expectation value of each S_i · S_j term.

Given that each S_i is (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So, S_i · S_j = (ħ²/4) (σ_i · σ_j). Therefore, the expectation value of S_i · S_j is (ħ²/4) Tr(σ_i σ_j) for the state psi.

The trace Tr(σ_i σ_j) is equal to 2 S_ij, where S_ij is the sum of the Pauli matrices σ_i and σ_j. Wait, no, actually, Tr(σ_i σ_j) for i ≠ j is 2 δ_ij, but no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me recall that for any two Pauli matrices σ_i and σ_j, the trace Tr(σ_i σ_j) is 2 δ_ij, where δ_ij is the Kronecker delta. So, when i ≠ j, Tr(σ_i σ_j) = 0, and when i = j, it's 2.

But in our case, we have (σ_i · σ_j), so for i ≠ j, Tr(σ_i σ_j) = 2 δ_ij, which is zero. Wait, no. Wait, actually, Tr(σ_i σ_j) is 2 δ_ij, but when we take the trace of σ_i · σ_j, it's the sum over k of Tr(σ_i σ_k σ_j). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that σ_i · σ_j = 2 P_ij, where P_ij is the spin exchange operator between particles i and j. So, Tr(σ_i σ_j) = 2 δ_ij. Wait, no, because σ_i · σ_j is a matrix, not a scalar. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_i · S_j in the state psi.

Let me think about the expectation value of S_i · S_j for the state psi. Since psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, maybe there's symmetry we can exploit.

Each term in psi is a product state with two up and one down. So, when computing the expectation value of S_i · S_j, we can perhaps compute it for each term in the sum and then average over the three terms.

Let me note that S_i · S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+). So, the expectation value of S_i · S_j is (1/4)(⟨psi| S_i^+ S_j^- |psi⟩ + ⟨psi| S_i^- S_j^+ |psi⟩ ). Let's compute ⟨psi| S_i^+ S_j^- |psi⟩ for each pair (i,j).

Given that our state psi is a sum of three terms, each with two up and one down, when we apply S_i^+ S_j^-, which raises spin i and lowers spin j, we need to see how this affects each term.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that for a given pair (i,j), in each term of psi, either both are up, both are down, or one is up and the other is down.

Looking at each term in psi:

1. |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩: Here, S1·S2 is (↑↑) · (↑↓), but wait, no. Let me correct that. For each term, each spin is either up or down. So, S_i · S_j is a tensor product of spin operators for i and j.

Wait, perhaps to compute the expectation value of S_i · S_j for each term, I can compute it for each basis state and then take the average.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that for each pair (i,j), the expectation value of S_i · S_j in the state psi can be calculated by considering the possible spin configurations.

Let me take an example: S1·S2.

In the state |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩, S1·S2 = (1/2)( (↑₁↑₂) · (↑₁↓₃) )? Wait, no, that's not correct. S1·S2 is an operator that acts on particles 1 and 2, and S3 is separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of expectation values.

For each pair (i,j), the expectation value ⟨psi| S_i · S_j |psi⟩ can be computed by considering that in each term in psi, particles i and j can be in various spin states.

Given that psi is symmetric in i, j, k, let's consider each pair.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value for each S_i·S_j and then sum them.

Wait, let me think about each term in H, which is A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So the total expectation value of H is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Therefore, I can compute each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ separately.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Each term in psi is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩. For each of these, compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

In |↑↑↓⟩: S1 is up, S2 is up, S3 is down.

The operator S1·S2 can be written as (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

So, the expectation value in |↑↑↓⟩ is ⟨↑|S1_x|↑⟩ ⟨↑|S2_x|↑⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_y|↑⟩ ⟨↑|S2_y|↑⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_z|↑⟩ ⟨↑|S2_z|↑⟩.

But for spin-up, S_z |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, and S_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S_y |↑⟩ = (iħ/2)|↓⟩. So, the expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2), but the expectation values of S_x and S_y are zero because ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ = 0.

Wait, that's not correct. Actually, for any eigenstate of S_z, the expectation value of S_x is zero because S_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ = 0. Similarly, ⟨↑|S_y|↑⟩ = 0. So, for the state |↑↑↓⟩, the expectation value of S1·S2 would be (⟨↑|S1_z |↑⟩)(⟨↑|S2_z |↑⟩) = (ħ/2)^2.

Similarly, for the state |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, S3 is up.

So, S1·S2 would be (⟨↑|S1_z |↑⟩)(⟨↓|S2_z |↓⟩) = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = - (ħ²)/4.

Wait, but that's only the S_z component. What about S_x and S_y?

Wait, no, because in this state, S1 is up and S2 is down, so when considering S1·S2, it's (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z). So, in this state, let's compute each term:

⟨↑↓↑| S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑|S1_x |↑⟩ ⟨↓|S2_x |↓⟩ = 0 * 0 = 0.

Similarly, ⟨↑↓↑| S1_y S2_y |↑↓↑⟩ = ⟨↑|S1_y |↑⟩ ⟨↓|S2_y |↓⟩ = 0 * 0 = 0.

⟨↑↓↑| S1_z S2_z |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = - (ħ²)/4.

So, the total expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↓↑⟩ is - (ħ²)/4.

Similarly, for the state |↓↑↑⟩, which is another term in psi.

In |↓↑↑⟩, S1 is down, S2 is up, S3 is up.

So, S1·S2 would be (⟨↓|S1_z |↓⟩)(⟨↑|S2_z |↑⟩) = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2) = - (ħ²)/4.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when we have a product state like |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so for |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 would be S1·S2 acting on particles 1 and 2, so the expectation value is ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ * ⟨↓|↓⟩.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so it's ⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ * ⟨↑|↑⟩.

So, let's compute it properly.

First, for the state |↑↑↓⟩:

⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (⟨↑| S1_z |↑⟩)(⟨↑| S2_z |↑⟩) + ⟨↑|S1_x S2_x |↑⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_y S2_y |↑⟩.

But as I thought before, ⟨↑| S1_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2, same for S2_z. The terms involving S_x and S_y will have expectation value zero because ⟨↑|S_x|↑⟩ = 0 and ⟨↑|S_y|↑⟩ = 0.

So, ⟨↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 = ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the state |↑↓↑⟩:

⟨↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ = (⟨↑| S1_z |↑⟩)(⟨↓| S2_z |↓⟩) + ⟨↑|S1_x S2_x |↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑|S1_y S2_y |↑↓⟩.

Now, S2_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↓| S2_z |↓⟩ = -ħ/2.

⟨↑| S1_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2.

So, the first term is (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

The other terms involve S_x and S_y. Let's compute them:

⟨↑| S1_x |↑⟩ = 0, and ⟨↑| S2_x |↓⟩ = 0 because |↓⟩ is orthogonal to |↑⟩.

Similarly, ⟨↑| S1_y |↑⟩ = 0, and ⟨↑| S2_y |↓⟩ = 0.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in |↑↓↑⟩ is -ħ²/4.

Similarly, in |↓↑↑⟩, S1 is down and S2 is up, so:

⟨↓↑| S1·S2 |↓↑⟩ = (⟨↓| S1_z |↓⟩)(⟨↑| S2_z |↑⟩) + ⟨↓|S1_x S2_x |↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓|S1_y S2_y |↓↑⟩.

S1_z |↓⟩ = (-ħ/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨↓| S1_z |↓⟩ = -ħ/2.

S2_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2, so ⟨↑| S2_z |↑⟩ = ħ/2.

So, the first term is (-ħ/2)(ħ/2) =
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether psi is an eigenfunction of H, and if not, what's the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall that spin operators for particles are vectors, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2). Since each spin is 1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², same for S2² and S3².

So, maybe I can rewrite each dot product term. Let's compute S1·S2:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2²
= (1/2)(S1² + 2 S1·S2 + S2²) - S1² - S2²
= (1/2)(S1² + S2²) + S1·S2 - S1² - S2²
= - (1/2)(S1² + S2²) + S1·S2

Wait, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, S1·S2 can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared for particles 1 and 2.

Wait, for two particles, S_total² = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. So, solving for S1·S2:

S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

Therefore, H can be written as H = A*( (S12² - S1² - S2²)/2 + (S13² - S1² - S3²)/2 + (S23² - S2² - S3²)/2 ), where S12 is S1 + S2, etc.

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the total spin squared for all three particles.

Wait, let me try that. The total spin squared S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 )

Since S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ², let me compute that:

H = A*( (S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) / 2 )

H = (A/2)( S_total² - (9/4)ħ² )

So, H = (A/2) S_total² - (A/2)(9/4)ħ²

But I'm not sure if this helps yet. Maybe.

Now, the state psi is given as a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let's see: each term is two up and one down, with the down particle in different positions. So, it's a symmetric state under exchange of particles 1, 2, 3.

Wait, if the state is symmetric under permutation, then it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared operator because the total spin is determined by the state's symmetry.

But let me check the total spin of this state. For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be S = 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi is symmetric under exchange, so it must be in a symmetric representation, which for three particles is either S=3/2 or some combination of S=1/2 and S=3/2, but since it's symmetric, it could be an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ².

Wait, let me compute the possible total spin. The state psi has two spin-up and one spin-down. The total spin is the sum of the three spins. Each spin is 1/2, so the possible totals range from 3/2 (all up) down to 1/2.

But this state is symmetric under exchange. So, if I have two up and one down, the total spin might be S=1/2 or 3/2. Let me check.

If the state is symmetric, it must transform under the symmetric representation of the permutation group. For three particles, the symmetric representation is either S=3/2 or a symmetric combination of S=1/2 particles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² for this state. Let me think.

The eigenvalue of S_total² is S(S+1)ħ². So, if I can find S for the state psi, then I can compute S_total².

But how? Let's consider the state psi. It has two up and one down. Let me try to write it in terms of spin-up and spin-down. So, each term has two up and one down.

Wait, suppose I express it in terms of the total spin states. For three particles, we have possible total spin states S=3/2 and S=1/2.

The state with all spins up is |3/2, 3/2> and |3/2, -3/2>.

The two-up one-down state must be a linear combination of |1/2, 1/2> and |3/2, ...>. Let me recall how the total spin states are constructed.

For three particles, the singlet (S=1/2) states are antisymmetric or symmetric? Wait, the singlet state for three particles is actually a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric parts, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S_total² acting on psi and see the result.

So, S_total² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already have that S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ², so S1² + S2² + S3² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, S_total² = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

From earlier, we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, H = (A/2)*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²)

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (2H)/A = (S_total² - (9/4)ħ²)/2

Thus, S_total² = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (9/4)ħ² + (S_total² - (9/4)ħ² ) = S_total².

Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe let me proceed step by step.

Compute S_total² acting on psi:

S_total² |psi> = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

First, expand the square:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi> = S1² |psi> + S2² |psi> + S3² |psi> + 2 S1·S2 |psi> + 2 S1·S3 |psi> + 2 S2·S3 |psi>

We know S1², S2², S3², so:

= (9/4 ħ²) |psi> + 2 (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi>

So,

S_total² |psi> = (9/4 ħ² + 2 (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi> )

But from earlier, we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so

2 (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (2/A) H

Therefore,

S_total² |psi> = (9/4 ħ²) |psi> + (2/A) H |psi>

So,

S_total² |psi> - (2/A) H |psi> = (9/4 ħ²) |psi>

Thus,

( S_total² - (2/A) H ) |psi> = (9/4 ħ²) |psi>

So, unless the eigenvalues match, this doesn't directly help. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S_total² on the state psi.

But maybe another approach: compute the expectation value of H in the state psi.

The expectation value of H is <psi| H |psi> = A <psi| (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |psi>

So, let's compute each term:

Compute <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, <S2·S3>, then sum them and multiply by A.

First, compute <S1·S2>. Since S_i are spin operators, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i² + S_j²)/2

Wait, as I did before, S_i·S_j = (S_ij² - S_i² - S_j²)/2

So, <S1·S2> = [ <psi| S1·S2 |psi> ] = [ <psi| (S12² - S1² - S2²)/2 |psi> ]

Similarly for the others.

But let's compute <S1·S2> first.

Compute <S12²>: the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2.

Which is <psi| S1² + 2 S1·S2 + S2² |psi> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>

Wait, but that's the same as the original expression. Hmm, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for each pair, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> can be expressed in terms of the total spin for that pair.

Given that the state psi is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down, for each pair, how does it look?

Wait, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), the state psi has certain properties.

Let me think of pair (1,2). In the state psi, what is the state of spins 1 and 2?

Looking at psi: the first term is up1 up2 down3, so for this term, spins 1 and 2 are both up. The second term is up1 down2 up3, so for this term, spin 1 is up, spin 2 is down. The third term is down1 up2 up3, so spin 1 is down, spin 2 is up.

So, if I consider |psi> = 1/sqrt(3) [ |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ]

If I fix spins 1 and 2, then the possible combinations are:

For each term, the state of spins 1 and 2:

- up up
- up down
- down up

So, when we take the expectation value of S1·S2, we can compute the average of (S1·S2) over the three terms.

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, the expectation value of S1·S2 should be the same for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

Wait, is that true? Because the state is symmetric under permutation, the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 should all be equal.

So, I can compute one of them, say <S1·S2>, and then triple it and multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>:

In each term of |psi>, spins 1 and 2 can be (up, up), (up, down), or (down, up). The coefficients for each term are 1/sqrt(3), so each term contributes equally.

Compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in each term:

1. For |up up down>:
   S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ²
   (since both are up)

2. For |up down up>:
   S1·S2 = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ²

3. For |down up up>:
   S1·S2 = (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ²

So, the expectation value <S1·S2> is the average of these three contributions:

= (1/sqrt(3))^2 [ (3/4)ħ² + (-1/4)ħ² + (-1/4)ħ² ]
= (1/3) [ (3/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ħ² ]
= (1/3) [ (3/4 - 2/4) ħ² ]
= (1/3)(1/4 ħ²)
= 1/12 ħ²

Wait, that seems small. But is that correct?

Wait, each term's expectation is (3/4), (-1/4), (-1/4), but they are all multiplied by 1/3.

Wait, so:

(1/3)*(3/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) = (1/3)*(3/4 - 2/4) = (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12.

Yes, that's correct.

So, <S1·S2> = 1/12 ħ²

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> will also be 1/12 ħ² each.

Therefore, the expectation value of H is:

< H > = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )
= A*( 3*(1/12) ħ² )
= A*( 1/4 ħ² )
= (A/4) ħ²

Wait, but the given answer is 3/4 A ħ². So, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing <S1·S2>. Let me check again.

When I calculated <S1·S2>, I considered each term in psi and computed their expectation values.

In the first term, |up up down>, the spins of 1 and 2 are both up, so S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

In the second term, |up down up>, spin 1 is up, spin 2 is down. The dot product for S1·S2 would be (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

Similarly, the third term |down up up>, spin 1 is down, spin 2 is up: (1/2)(-1/2)ħ² = (-1/4)ħ².

So, adding these up: (3/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) = 1/4.

But then we took the average over the three terms, each with weight 1/sqrt(3), so <S1·S2> = (1/3)*(1/4 ħ²) = 1/12 ħ².

Wait, that seems right, but I get 1/12. But the given answer is 3/4 A ħ². So, maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, in H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and I computed each expectation as 1/12 ħ², so 3*(1/12) = 1/4. So, <H> = A*(1/4) ħ², which is (A/4) ħ².

But the answer is 3/4 A ħ².

Hmm. So, maybe my mistake is in the computation of the expectation value of S1·S2.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of (S1·S2) differently. Maybe using total spin.

Wait, for each pair, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2

Thus, S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ]
