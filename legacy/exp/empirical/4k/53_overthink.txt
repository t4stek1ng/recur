[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is: A. deflected in the +x-direction?"

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what's going on here.

First, the proton is being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. Since it's moving in the +z-direction after that, I assume it's accelerated in the z-direction. So, initially, the proton has some kinetic energy, and its velocity is along the +z-axis.

Now, after this acceleration, the proton enters a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The key point here is that the proton's trajectory is not affected. That probably means that the electric and magnetic fields don't cause any deflection because their effects somehow cancel each other out or something.

Wait, how can electric and magnetic fields not affect the trajectory? Normally, when a charged particle enters electric and magnetic fields, it experiences a force, which causes it to deflect. But maybe the velocity of the proton is such that the electric force cancels the magnetic force? Or perhaps the electric and magnetic fields are arranged in a way that their forces are in opposite directions, resulting in no net force.

Let me recall the Lorentz force equation: F = q(E + v × B). The proton has a charge q = +e. So the force on the proton is e(E + v × B).

In this case, E is in the +x-direction, B is in the +y-direction, and the velocity v is in the +z-direction. So let's compute v × B first.

v is along +z, B is along +y. The cross product of z and y in standard right-hand coordinate system is... Hmm, cross product of z (unit vector) × y (unit vector) = -x (unit vector). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Using the right-hand rule: Point your index finger in the direction of v, which is +z. Then, your middle finger should point in the direction of B, which is +y. But since v is in z and B is in y, the cross product v × B is actually in the -x direction. Because z × y = -x.

So, v × B = -x. Therefore, the magnetic part of the force is e*(-x) = -e x hat.

Now, the electric field E is +x. So E is in the +x direction, and the magnetic force is in the -x direction.

So the total force is e(E + v × B) = e( (+x) + (-x) ) = 0. So net force is zero.

That explains why the proton's trajectory is not affected. Because the electric force and magnetic force cancel each other out.

So, in this initial setup, with potential difference V, the proton ends up with velocity in +z, and then enters these fields where E and B are such that F = 0, so no deflection.

Now, the question is, if we repeat the experiment but use a potential difference of 2V instead of V, what happens?

So, the proton is now accelerated through 2V instead of V. Since potential difference is related to the kinetic energy gained, the proton will have twice the kinetic energy as before.

But wait, what's the relation between the potential difference and the kinetic energy?

For a charge q, the potential difference V causes a change in electric potential energy, which translates to kinetic energy if the charge is moving through a region with negligible magnetic effects. So, the kinetic energy gained is qV.

So, if initially, the proton had kinetic energy (1/2)mv², which came from the potential difference V, then with potential difference 2V, the kinetic energy would be 2qV, so 2*(1/2 mv²) = mv²? Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, actually, the kinetic energy is equal to the charge times the potential difference, so (1/2)mv² = qΔV.

So if ΔV is doubled, then the kinetic energy becomes 2qV, so the velocity v would be sqrt(2qV/m). Wait, but actually, the kinetic energy is proportional to the potential difference, so v would be proportional to sqrt(ΔV).

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the initial velocity.

If the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, then its velocity is v = sqrt(2qV/m). If the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the velocity becomes v' = sqrt(2q(2V)/m) = sqrt(2qV/m) * sqrt(2) = v * sqrt(2). So the velocity increases by a factor of sqrt(2). So it's moving faster.

But wait, does that affect the subsequent motion through E and B fields? Because earlier, with velocity v along +z, the electric and magnetic forces canceled each other.

But if the velocity is higher, maybe the forces no longer cancel? Let me see.

Wait, no. The force is F = e(E + v × B). So if v is higher, but E and v × B are still in opposite directions, their magnitudes might still result in a net force.

Wait, let's go back to the initial situation.

In the first case, the velocity is v in +z. So:

F = e(E + v × B) = e( (+x) + (-x) ) = 0. So F = 0.

In the second case, the velocity is v' = sqrt(2) v in +z. So:

F = e(E + v' × B) = e( (+x) + (-x') ) where x' is direction of v' × B.

Wait, but the velocity is still in +z, so v' × B is still along -x, just with a higher magnitude.

So, F = e( (+x) + ( -x') ) = e( (E_x - v' × B_x ) )

But in the first case, with velocity v, v × B was -x, so E_x = |v × B|, so E = |v × B|, but with E being in +x.

Wait, in the first case, when v was such that E = v × B, right? Because if E is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to v × B, they cancel. But let me see.

Wait, in the first case, E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, so E = |v × B|, hence E = vB.

Because if E is in +x and v × B is in -x, their magnitudes are equal so E = vB.

So, E = vB.

In the second case, velocity is v' = sqrt(2) v. So E is still in +x, B is still in +y.

So, E = v' B?

Wait, originally, E = vB. If the velocity is now v', then would E still equal v' B? Or does E stay the same?

Wait, the problem states that E is a uniform electric field in +x-direction and B is a uniform magnetic field in +y-direction regardless of the velocity.

So E and B are fixed, and the velocity is increased.

So, in the original case, E = vB.

In the new case, E is the same, B is the same, but velocity is higher.

So, now, v' = sqrt(2) v.

So, E = vB, but v' = sqrt(2) v.

Then, E = v' * (v / sqrt(2)) * B.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me write the expressions.

Initially:

E = vB.

After the potential difference is doubled:

v' = sqrt(2) v.

But E is still the same, right? Because the electric field is given as E in +x-direction, so E is the same as before.

So E = vB, but also E = v' B'.

But wait, is B the same? The problem says "a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction". So B is the same, right? Because only the potential difference is changed.

So, E = vB and E = v' B. Therefore, v' = vB / B = v. Wait, that can't be, unless E is also changed.

Wait, no, let's think carefully.

In the first case:

The proton is accelerated through V, so its velocity is v = sqrt(2qV/m).

Then, it enters E (in +x) and B (in +y).

From Lorentz force, we had E = v × B, so E = |v × B|.

But since v is in +z, v × B is in -x, so E must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so E = - (v × B). Wait, but the direction is given as +x.

Wait, maybe I messed up the direction.

Wait, E is in +x, v is in +z, B is in +y.

So, v × B is z × y = -x, right?

So, the magnetic force is F_m = e(v × B) = -e x.

The electric force is F_e = e E, which is +e x.

So, to have F = 0, we need E = |v × B|.

So, E = |v × B|. Since v × B is in -x, E is in +x, so E = |v||B| sin(theta), but since B is in +y, and v is in +z, the angle between v and B is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1.

Therefore, E = |v||B|. Wait, but E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, so E must be equal in magnitude to v × B, which is in -x. But E is in +x, so E = |v × B|.

Wait, if E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, then E must be equal in magnitude to |v × B|, but in the opposite direction? No, because in the first case, the forces canceled out, so E must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to v × B.

Wait, no, because E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, so if E is equal in magnitude, then E = |v × B|, so E = vB, since v and B are perpendicular (angle 90 degrees). So, E = vB.

So E is in +x, and B is in +y.

Therefore, in the first case, E = vB.

In the second case, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its velocity is v' = sqrt(2) v.

But E and B are still the same.

So, now, E = v' B?

No, because E is still equal to vB, but v' = sqrt(2) v.

Wait, so E = vB, and E = v' B.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the first case, E = vB. In the second case, E is the same, so E = vB = v' B'.

But B is the same, so E = vB = v' B => same B, so if E is same, v' must be equal to v, which contradicts unless E is changed.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify.

In the first case:

Proton accelerated through V, so velocity v = sqrt(2qV/m).

Then, E is in +x, B is in +y.

From F = 0: e(E + v × B) = 0 => E = -v × B. Since v × B is in -x, E is in +x, so E = |v × B|.

But since v is in +z, B is in +y, v × B is in -x, so |v × B| = vB, since they are perpendicular.

So, E = vB.

Therefore, in the first case, E = vB.

In the second case, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its velocity is v' = sqrt(2) v.

But E is still in +x, B is still in +y.

Now, what happens?

Compute the force: F = e(E + v' × B).

E is still +x, v' is in +z.

v' × B is z × y = -x. So, same as before, magnitude is v' B, direction is -x.

So, F = e( (+x) + (-x') ), where x' is in -x direction.

But the magnitude is E = vB, and v' × B = v' B.

So, in the first case, E = vB = v' B, but in the second case, E = vB and v' = sqrt(2) v. So, E = vB, and v' = sqrt(2) v => E = vB, and v' B = sqrt(2) v B.

So, E = vB = sqrt(2) v B / sqrt(2) ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, in the first case, E = vB.

In the second case, v' = sqrt(2) v, but E is still the same, E = vB.

Therefore, in the second case, E = vB, and v' = sqrt(2) v.

So, when the proton enters the fields, E = vB, and v' is sqrt(2) v.

So, E = vB and v' = sqrt(2) v.

Therefore, E = vB = sqrt(2) v B / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, I think I'm not getting this right.

Wait, E is a given field, fixed in the region. So, in the first case, E = vB.

In the second case, E is same, but velocity is higher. So, if E = vB, and v increases, B is fixed, then E would have to increase as well, but E is fixed in the problem. Wait, no, in the problem statement, E is given as a uniform electric field in +x-direction, regardless of the velocity.

So, E is fixed, B is fixed. So, in the first case, E = vB, so v = E/B.

In the second case, v' = sqrt(2) v = sqrt(2) E / B.

So, the velocity is higher, but E and B remain same.

Therefore, when the proton enters the fields, E is same, B is same, but velocity is higher.

So, what is the force now?

F = e(E + v' × B).

E is in +x, v' is in +z, B is in +y. So, v' × B is in -x.

Thus, E is +x, v' × B is -x.

So, the total force is e*( (+x) + (-x') ), where x' is the magnitude of v' × B.

But let's compute the magnitudes.

E is same, v' is sqrt(2) v, and since in first case, E = vB, v' = sqrt(2) v = sqrt(2) (E/B).

So, the electric force is eE.

The magnetic force is e(v' × B) = e(-x direction) with magnitude e(v' B).

But since v' = sqrt(2) v, and v = E/B, then v' = sqrt(2) E / B.

Therefore, magnetic force magnitude is e*(sqrt(2) E / B)*B = e sqrt(2) E.

So, total force is eE - e sqrt(2) E = e (1 - sqrt(2)) E.

So, it's a net force in the -x direction.

But wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, in the first case, E = vB, and F = 0.

In the second case, E is same, but v' is higher.

So, E = vB, and v' = sqrt(2) v.

So, v' = sqrt(2) (E / B).

So, when we compute the magnetic force: F_m = e(v' × B) = e( (sqrt(2) E / B) × B ) = e (sqrt(2) E × (B/B)) ) = e sqrt(2) E.

So, direction is same as before, -x.

So, F_m = -e sqrt(2) E x hat.

Electric force: F_e = e E x hat.

So, net force: F = F_e + F_m = e E x hat - e sqrt(2) E x hat = e E (1 - sqrt(2)) x hat.

So, this is a net force in the -x direction.

But that would cause the proton to deflect in the -x direction.

But the options given are A. +x, B. -x, C. +y, D. -y.

But the correct answer is A. So, why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, let's compute the direction again.

E is in +x, B is in +y.

v' is in +z.

So, v' × B is (z) × (y) = -x.

So, the magnetic force is F_m = e(-x).

Electric force is F_e = e(+x).

So, net force is F = e(+x) + e(-
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the correct answer is that the proton is deflected in the +x-direction when the potential difference is increased to 2V. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields.

First, when a proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, it gains kinetic energy. The energy gained is equal to the charge of the proton multiplied by the potential difference, right? So, the kinetic energy (KE) is given by:

KE = (eV) / 2

Wait, no, actually, the kinetic energy when accelerated through a potential difference V is (1/2)mv², and since the potential energy is eV, the kinetic energy is the same as that. So, v = sqrt(2eV/m), where e is the proton's charge, V is the potential, and m is its mass. Okay, so the initial velocity is in the +z-direction.

Now, after that, the proton enters a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The problem says the proton’s trajectory is not affected. Hmm, that part is confusing. Why isn't the trajectory affected?

Wait, if the proton is moving in the +z-direction and then enters an electric field in the +x-direction, there should be a force acting on it. The electric force is F_e = eE. Since the proton's velocity is in the +z-direction, the force is in the +x-direction, which would cause it to accelerate in the +x-direction. But the problem says the trajectory is not affected. Maybe the electric and magnetic fields are such that they cancel each other out in some way?

Wait, maybe I need to consider the Lorentz force on the proton. The total force is the sum of the electric force and the magnetic force. The electric force is F_e = eE in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force is F_m = e(v × B) in the direction determined by the cross product.

Given that the velocity v is in the +z-direction, and the magnetic field B is in the +y-direction, the cross product v × B is in the +x-direction because z cross y is x. So, F_m is in the +x-direction as well.

So, both forces are in the +x-direction, which means the net force is 2eEx in the +x-direction. That would accelerate the proton even more in the +x-direction, right?

But the problem says the trajectory is not affected. Hmm, maybe the electric and magnetic fields are set such that the electric force and magnetic force cancel each other out? But in this case, they are both in the same direction, so they add up, not cancel.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the proton is not deflected because the electric and magnetic forces are equal and opposite? But for that, their directions must be opposite. If E were in the -x-direction and B in the +y-direction, then F_e would be -eE and F_m would be +e(v × B) in the +x-direction. Then, depending on the magnitudes, they could cancel or not. But in our case, E is +x and B is +y, so the forces add up.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. The problem says that the proton’s trajectory is not affected, which suggests that the net force is zero. But according to my earlier calculation, the net force is eE + e(v × B). Let me compute that.

Since v is in the +z-direction, v × B is (0, 0, vz) × (0, By, 0) = (-vy*0, vz*0 - 0*By, vz*By) = (0, 0, vz*By). Wait, hold on, cross product of unit vectors: z cross y is x? Wait, no, the cross product of z (unit vector) and y (unit vector) is -x. Let me recall the right-hand rule. If I point my index finger in the direction of v (z-axis), and my middle finger in the direction of B (y-axis), then my thumb points in the direction of v × B. So, z cross y is -x. So, F_m is in the -x-direction.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check again.

Cross product of two vectors: A × B. The formula is:

If A = (A_x, A_y, A_z) and B = (B_x, B_y, B_z), then A × B = (A_y B_z - A_z B_y, A_z B_x - A_x B_z, A_x B_y - A_y B_x).

So, if velocity v is in +z-direction, which is (0, 0, vz), and B is in +y-direction, which is (0, By, 0). So, v × B = (vz * 0 - 0 * By, 0 * 0 - 0 * 0, 0 * By - vz * 0) = (0, 0, 0). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, the cross product of z and y is -x. Wait, but in terms of unit vectors, i × j = k, j × k = i, k × i = j. So, z (which is k) cross y (which is j) is k × j = -i. So, yes, the cross product is -x direction.

Wait, but hold on, v is (0, 0, vz), so v × B is (vz * 0 - 0 * By, 0 * 0 - 0 * 0, 0 * By - vz * 0) = (0, 0, 0). Hmm, that seems incorrect because if velocity is along z and B is along y, the cross product should be along x.

Wait, maybe I confused the order. It's v × B, not B × v.

So, if v is along z, B is along y, then v × B = z × y = - (y × z) = - (z × y). Wait, cross product is anti-commutative. So, z × y = - (y × z). Let me recall: j × k = -i, k × j = i. So, z × y = -x, which is -i. Therefore, v × B is in the -x direction.

But, wait, isn't that conflicting with the formula? Because, if v is (0, 0, vz), and B is (0, By, 0), then:

v × B = (vz * 0 - 0 * By, 0 * 0 - 0 * 0, 0 * By - vz * 0) = (0, 0, 0). Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, no, that's because I think the formula I used is for the cross product of vectors, but cross product of a vector with a unit vector is not necessarily the same as cross product of unit vectors. Wait, no, actually, cross product is linear, so it should work the same way.

Wait, maybe my confusion is coming from the fact that I'm thinking in terms of unit vectors, but in reality, if v is along z, it's (0, 0, vz), and B is (0, By, 0). Then, cross product v × B is (vz * 0 - 0 * By)i - (0 * 0 - 0 * 0)j + (0 * By - vz * 0)k = 0i - 0j + 0k = 0. That can't be.

But that can't be, because when you have velocity along z and magnetic field along y, the magnetic force should be along x. So, what is wrong here?

Wait, maybe the velocity is in the +z direction, and the magnetic field is in the +y direction, then the direction of the magnetic force is found by the right-hand rule: point the index finger in the direction of velocity (z), middle finger in the direction of B (y), then thumb is the direction of v × B, which should be towards -x direction.

Wait, so the magnetic force is in the -x direction. So, the magnetic force is -e(v × B) = -e*(-E_x direction), so that would be in the +x direction.

Wait, let me clarify.

If the velocity is along +z and B is along +y, then the magnetic force is in the direction of v × B. Using the right-hand rule, pointing index finger along +z, middle finger along +y, the thumb points in the direction of the force, which is -x. So, the magnetic force is in the -x direction.

So, F_m = e(v × B) = e*(-x direction) = -eE_x. Therefore, the magnetic force is in the -x direction.

Meanwhile, the electric force is F_e = eE, which is in the +x direction.

So, the total force is F_e + F_m = eE - eE = 0. So, the net force is zero. Therefore, the proton is not deflected. That's why the trajectory is not affected.

Okay, so that makes sense. The electric force and the magnetic force are equal and opposite, so the proton isn't deflected. Therefore, in the original scenario, with potential difference V, the proton is not deflected.

Now, if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, what happens?

So, initially, the kinetic energy gained was (1/2)mv² = eV.

When the potential difference is 2V, the kinetic energy becomes (1/2)mv²' = e*2V.

Therefore, v' = sqrt(2e(2V)/m) = sqrt(4eV/m) = 2*sqrt(eV/m) = 2v.

So, the initial velocity is doubled.

Now, let's recalculate the forces. The electric force is F_e = eE in the +x direction. The magnetic force is F_m = e(v' × B). Since v' is now in the +z-direction, and B is in the +y-direction, the cross product still gives us v' × B in the -x direction. So, F_m = e*(-x direction) = -eE_x.

But now, the velocity is double, so |v'| = 2v. Therefore, the magnitude of F_m is e*(2v * B * sin(theta)), but in this case, theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1. So, F_m = e*(2v * B) in the -x direction.

Wait, but E is given as a uniform electric field in the +x direction. So, F_e = eE is in the +x direction.

So, comparing the magnitudes:

F_e = eE

F_m = e(2vB)

But wait, E is uniform, but what's the relation between E and v, B?

Wait, originally, before the potential difference was increased, the net force was zero, so F_e = F_m.

In the original case, v was in +z, so F_m = e(v × B) = e(vB) in the -x direction, right? Because v is +z, B is +y, so cross product is -x, and magnitude is vB. So, F_e = eE must equal F_m = e(vB). Therefore, E = vB.

So, in the original case, E = vB.

Therefore, in the original case, the electric field strength E is equal to the product of velocity v and magnetic field B.

Now, when we double the potential difference to 2V, the velocity becomes 2v. So, let's see.

In the new case, the velocity is 2v, E is still equal to vB, since E = vB from before.

Wait, so E is equal to vB, but v has now doubled, so let me see how this affects the forces.

Wait, no. Wait, in the original case, E = vB because F_e = F_m, so eE = e(vB). Thus, E = vB.

In the new case, velocity is 2v, but E is still equal to vB? Or does E change?

Wait, no, E is a property of the electric field, which is applied externally, independent of the proton's velocity. So, E is applied regardless of the velocity.

Wait, but in the original case, the E field was set such that F_e = F_m, so E = vB.

In the new case, when the proton has velocity 2v, but E is still equal to vB. So, let's compute the forces.

F_e = eE = evB

F_m = e(2v × B) in the -x direction. But wait, the cross product is still -x, so F_m is -e(2vB).

Therefore, the total force is F_e + F_m = evB - e2vB = -evB.

So, net force is -evB in the -x direction, meaning the proton is deflected in the -x direction.

Wait, but the problem says that the trajectory is not affected when the potential difference is V, so the first time, it wasn't deflected. But when we double the potential difference, it starts being deflected.

Wait, but according to my calculation, with E = vB, F_e = evB, F_m = -e2vB, so net force is -evB, so the proton is deflected in the -x direction, which would be option B.

But the correct answer is supposed to be A, deflected in the +x direction. Hmm, so maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, let's go back.

Wait, in the original case, when the proton is at velocity v, E = vB. So, F_e = eE = evB in +x, F_m = e(v × B) = e(vB) in -x, so F_e = F_m, net force zero.

In the new case, velocity is 2v, but E is still vB, so F_e = e(vB) in +x, F_m = e(2vB) in -x. Thus, net force is -e(vB) in -x, so proton is deflected in -x.

But according to the problem statement, the correct answer is A, deflected in +x. So, my reasoning must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct relationship between E and B. Let me think differently.

The force due to electric field is F_e = eE, and the force due to magnetic field is F_m = e(v × B).

In the original case, before acceleration, the proton is at rest, then accelerated through V, so it gains velocity v in +z. Then, enters E and B fields.

If the trajectory is not affected, so net force is zero. So, at that instant, eE = e(v × B). So, E = v × B.

Wait, but the direction of E is +x, and the direction of (v × B) is -x, as we had before. So, E = - (v × B). Therefore, E is in the opposite direction of (v × B). So, E is in +x, and (v × B) is in -x, so E = - (v × B), so E is equal in magnitude to |v × B| but opposite in direction.

So, E = vB sin(theta). Wait, but in this case, theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1. So, E = vB.

Wait, but in vector terms, E is equal in magnitude to vB, and opposite in direction.

Wait, but E is a vector, so maybe E = -vB? Because if (v × B) is in -x, then E is in +x, so E = - (v × B) magnitude-wise.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of magnitudes.

So, |E| = |v × B|.

So, |E| = |v||B|sin(theta).

In our case, theta is 90 degrees, so |E| = vB.

So, E = vB, but considering the direction, E is in +x, and (v × B) is in -x, so E = - (v × B). Therefore, E is equal and opposite to (v × B). So, that's why the net force is zero.

Okay, so that makes sense.

Now, when the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the proton's velocity becomes 2v, so let's compute E again.

Wait, no, E is a property of the external field, not of the proton. So, E remains the same. Because E is set by the experiment, not by the proton's motion.

So, in the first case, E was equal to vB, but in the second case, velocity is 2v, but E is still equal to vB? Wait, that can't be, because E is a fixed value.

Wait, hold on, I'm confusing between the E in the original case and E in the new case.

Wait, in the original case, the proton is accelerated through V, which gives it velocity v. At that moment, it enters the E and B fields, and E is set such that E = vB, so that the net force is zero.

In the new case, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its velocity is 2v. When it enters the same E and B fields, E is equal to vB, but the velocity is 2v.

Therefore, the magnetic force is F_m = e(v' × B) = e(2v × B) = e(2vB) in the direction of -x.

Meanwhile, the electric force is F_e = eE = evB in +x.

So, comparing the two forces: F_e = evB, F_m = -e2vB.

Therefore, net force is F_e + F_m = evB - e2vB = -evB.

So, the net force is -evB in the -x direction,
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a proton moving through electric and magnetic fields. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step. 

First, the problem says that a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. That means the proton starts with zero initial velocity and gains some kinetic energy due to the electric potential. I remember that when a charged particle is accelerated through a potential difference, its kinetic energy increases. The work done by the electric field is equal to the change in kinetic energy. So, the electric potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. 

The equation I remember is the work done by the electric field is \( eV \), where \( e \) is the charge of the proton and \( V \) is the potential. Since the proton starts from rest, its kinetic energy after acceleration would be \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV \). So, the velocity \( v \) can be found as \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} \). I don't know if I need the exact value, but it's good to note that the velocity is in the +z-direction.

Now, after being accelerated, the proton enters a region with a uniform electric field \( E \) in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field \( B \) in the +y-direction. The problem states that the proton's trajectory isn't affected. Hmm, that's interesting. So, under the influence of these fields, nothing happens? That must mean that the net force on the proton is zero. 

Wait, the electric field is in the +x-direction, so the electric force would be \( F_e = eE \) in the +x-direction. The magnetic field is in the +y-direction, so the magnetic force would be \( F_b = e(v \times B) \). Let me compute this cross product. If the velocity is in +z, and B is in +y, the cross product \( v \times B \) is in the direction given by the right-hand rule. 

So, pointing my index finger in the +z-direction (velocity) and middle finger in the +y-direction (B), the thumb would point in the -x-direction. Therefore, the magnetic force is \( -eEx \) direction, which is in the -x-direction. 

Wait, hold on. The electric force is \( +eE \) in +x, and the magnetic force is \( -eEx \) in -x. So, they are in opposite directions. If these forces cancel each other out, the net force is zero. That means the proton doesn't deflect from its trajectory. So, that explains why the trajectory isn't affected. 

But in the problem, it says the trajectory is not affected. So, in this case, the proton continues moving in the +z-direction without any deflection. So, that's the initial setup. 

Now, the question is, if the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V instead of V, what would happen? The options are about the direction of deflection: +x, -x, +y, or -y.

So, first, when the potential difference is 2V, the proton is accelerated from rest through 2V, so its initial velocity would be higher. Let me figure out how much higher. The velocity would be \( v' = \sqrt{\frac{2e(2V)}{m}} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} = \sqrt{2}v \). So, it's \( \sqrt{2} \) times the original velocity.

In the original case, with V, the velocity was \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} \). The electric force was \( eE \) in +x, and the magnetic force was \( -eEx \) in -x, canceling each other. So, no deflection.

Now, in the second case, the velocity is \( \sqrt{2}v \). So, the magnetic force would be \( e(v' \times B) = e(\sqrt{2}v \times B) \). Let's compute this cross product again. Velocity is in +z, B is in +y, so \( v' \times B \) is \( \sqrt{2}v \times B \). 

Using the right-hand rule, velocity in +z, B in +y: when you do \( v \times B \), it's in the -x direction. So, \( \sqrt{2}v \times B \) is also in the -x direction, but with a larger magnitude because of the \( \sqrt{2} \) factor. 

The magnetic force is \( F_b = e (\sqrt{2}v \times B) = \sqrt{2} e(v \times B) = \sqrt{2} (-eE) \), since \( v \times B = -E \times e \). Wait, no, actually \( F_b = e(v \times B) \). Wait, but earlier, \( v \times B \) was equal to \( -E \times \frac{v}{E} \times e \), no, maybe I confused things.

Wait, actually, originally, \( F_e = eE \) in +x, and \( F_b = e(v \times B) \). Since \( v \) is in +z, and \( B \) is in +y, \( v \times B \) is in -x. So, \( F_b = -eEx \), and \( F_e = +eEx \). Therefore, \( F_e = -F_b \), so they cancel each other.

In the case with 2V, the velocity is \( \sqrt{2}v \). So, the magnetic force becomes \( F_b' = e(\sqrt{2}v \times B) = \sqrt{2}e(v \times B) = \sqrt{2}(-eE) \). So, \( F_b' = -\sqrt{2}eE \) in the -x direction.

Meanwhile, the electric force is \( F_e = eE \) in the +x direction. So, now, we have \( F_e = +eE \) and \( F_b' = -\sqrt{2}eE \). These forces are in opposite directions, but with different magnitudes. The net force is \( F_{net} = F_e + F_b' = eE - \sqrt{2}eE = eE(1 - \sqrt{2}) \). 

Since \( 1 - \sqrt{2} \) is negative (approximately -0.414), the net force is in the negative x-direction. So, the proton will experience a net force in the -x direction. Therefore, it will deflect in the -x direction.

Wait, but that contradicts the initial statement that in the first case, the trajectory isn't affected. So, in the first case, \( F_b = -eE \) and \( F_e = +eE \), so they cancel. In the second case, the magnetic force is stronger because velocity is higher, so the magnetic force is now stronger in the -x direction, making the net force in the -x direction, hence deflecting the proton in the -x direction.

Wait, but the options given are:

A. deflected in the +x-direction,

B. deflected in the -x-direction,

C. deflected in the +y-direction,

D. deflected in the -y-direction.

So, according to my calculation, if we have a higher velocity, then the magnetic force is stronger in the -x direction, so the net force is -x, so the proton would be deflected in the -x direction, which is option B.

But the initial statement says that the correct answer is A, deflected in the +x-direction. Hmm, that's contradictory. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I messed up the direction of the magnetic force.

So, the force due to magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law: \( F = e(v \times B) \). The cross product \( v \times B \) depends on the order.

Let me write the velocity, B, and F.

Velocity \( v \) is in +z, B is in +y.

So, \( v \times B \) is in the direction given by the right-hand rule. Pointing fingers in +z (v), middle finger in +y (B), thumb is out. The thumb points in the -x direction. So, \( v \times B \) is in -x.

Therefore, \( F_b = e(v \times B) \) is in -x.

Electric force is \( F_e = eE \) in +x.

So, in the original case, when the velocity is \( v \), the magnetic force is \( -eE \), and electric force is \( +eE \), so they cancel.

In the second case, velocity is \( \sqrt{2}v \), so the magnetic force is \( -e \times \sqrt{2} E \).

Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the E is the electric field, which is in +x. So, is the magnetic force \( -e \times \sqrt{2} E \)?

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to write it out.

Electric field E is in +x, so the electric force is \( F_e = e E \) in +x.

Magnetic field B is in +y, and the velocity is in +z.

So, \( F_b = e(v \times B) = e( \hat{z} \times \hat{y} ) \).

What's \( \hat{z} \times \hat{y} \)?

Right-hand rule: index finger in z (up), middle finger in y (left). Thumb points in -x direction.

Yes, so \( \hat{z} \times \hat{y} = -\hat{x} \).

Therefore, \( F_b = -e E \), since \( v = \sqrt{2}v \), but wait, does the velocity scaling affect the direction?

No, the direction is determined by the cross product, which is independent of the magnitude. So, regardless of the speed, the direction of \( v \times B \) is the same. So, even though the velocity is higher, the direction of \( F_b \) is still -x. So, \( F_b = -e \times ( \sqrt{2}v ) \times B \), but the direction is still -x.

Wait, actually, no. The magnetic force is \( F_b = e v \times B \). If velocity is higher, the magnitude increases, but the direction remains the same.

Therefore, in the first case, \( F_b = -e E \) (because \( v \times B = -E \times \text{something} \)).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the equations of motion.

The equation of motion under electric and magnetic fields is given by:

\( \frac{dv_x}{dt} = eE - (e v_y B)_x \) (but wait, no, let's get the components right).

Wait, the magnetic force is \( F_b = e(v \times B) \), which can be broken into components.

Given \( v \) is in +z, so \( v = (0, 0, v_z) \).

\( B \) is in +y, so \( B = (0, B_y, 0) \).

Then, \( v \times B = (0, 0, v_z) \times (0, B_y, 0) = (B_y v_z, 0, 0) \).

Wait, no, cross product in 3D:

Given vectors \( \vec{v} = (0, 0, v_z) \) and \( \vec{B} = (0, B_y, 0) \), their cross product is:

\( \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = (v_z * 0 - 0 * B_y, 0 * 0 - v_z * 0, 0 * B_y - 0 * 0) = (0, 0, 0) \). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the cross product components.

The cross product \( \vec{A} \times \vec{B} \) is given by:

\( (A_x B_y - A_y B_x, A_y B_z - A_z B_y, A_z B_x - A_x B_z) \).

So, in this case, \( \vec{v} = (0, 0, v_z) \), \( \vec{B} = (0, B_y, 0) \).

So,

- First component: \( v_z * B_y - 0 * 0 = v_z B_y \),
- Second component: \( 0 * 0 - v_z * B_y = -v_z B_y \),
- Third component: \( 0 * 0 - 0 * B_y = 0 \).

Therefore, \( \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = (v_z B_y, -v_z B_y, 0) \).

So, \( F_b = e(v \times B) = e(v_z B_y, -v_z B_y, 0) \).

So, in the x and y directions: \( F_{bx} = e v_z B_y \), \( F_{by} = -e v_z B_y \). So, in the original case, where \( v_z = v \), the magnetic force components are \( F_{bx} = e v B_y \), \( F_{by} = -e v B_y \).

But wait, the electric field is in +x, so the electric force is \( F_e = eE \hat{x} \).

So, combining the forces, the net force in the x-direction is \( F_{net x} = eE - e v B_y \).

Wait, no, electric force is entirely in the x-direction, so \( F_{net x} = eE - e v B_y \).

Similarly, the net force in the y-direction is \( F_{net y} = -e v B_y \).

But in the original problem, the trajectory isn't affected. So, that must mean the net force is zero. So, \( F_{net x} = eE - e v B_y = 0 \).

Therefore, \( eE = e v B_y \) ⇒ \( E = v B_y \).

So, in the original case, \( E = v B_y \). So, that's why the magnetic force cancels the electric force, resulting in no net force.

Now, when we double the potential difference to 2V, the initial velocity \( v' = \sqrt{2}v \).

So, substitute back into \( F_{net x} = eE - e v' B_y \).

Since \( E = v B_y \), substitute that in:

\( F_{net x} = e(v B_y) - e(\sqrt{2}v) B_y = e v B_y (1 - \sqrt{2}) \).

Since \( 1 - \sqrt{2} \) is negative, \( F_{net x} \) is negative, meaning a force in the -x direction.

Therefore, the proton would feel a net force in the -x direction, so it would deflect in the -x direction.

But the initial reasoning said that the correct answer is A, deflected in the +x-direction. That contradicts my conclusion. So, what am I missing?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the direction of the electric field or the magnetic field? Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says: the proton passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction.

So, E is in +x, B is in +y.

Proton starts with velocity in +z, so \( v = (0, 0, v_z) \).

So, \( v \times B \) is \( (0, 0, v_z) \times (0, B_y, 0) = (v_z B_y, -v_z B_y, 0) \).

Thus, the magnetic force is \( F_b = e(v \times B) = (e v_z B_y, -e v_z B_y, 0) \).

Electric force is \( F_e = e E \hat{x} = (e E, 0, 0) \).

Net force is \( F_{net} = F_e + F_b = (e E + e v_z B_y, -e v_z B_y, 0) \).

So, in the x-direction: \( F_{net x} = e E + e v_z B_y \).

Wait, hold on, earlier I thought \( F_{net x} = eE - e v B_y \), but actually, it's eE plus e v_z B_y.

Wait, so maybe I messed up earlier.

Wait, in the original case, the problem says the trajectory is not affected, so net force is zero.

Therefore, \( F_{net x} = e E + e v_z B_y = 0 \), so \( E = -v_z B_y \).

Wait, that can't be, because E is in +x, and v_z is positive, B_y is positive.

So, E = -v_z B_y would imply E is negative, but in the problem, E is in +x, so positive. So, seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the cross product direction.

Wait, in the problem, the magnetic force is in the -x direction, and the electric force is in the +x direction, so they need to cancel each other.

Wait, if \( F_{net x} = e E - |F_{bx}| \). So, in vector terms, \( F_{net x} = e E - e v_z B_y \).

If the trajectory is not affected, then \( F_{net x} = 0 \), so \( e E = e v_z B_y \).

Thus,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here about a proton moving in electric and magnetic fields, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is that it gets deflected in the +x-direction when the potential difference is doubled. Let me start by unpacking the problem step by step.

First, the problem says a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. So initially, the proton is at rest and then gains some kinetic energy due to this potential difference. I remember that the work done by an electric field on a charge is given by the charge times the potential difference, so the initial kinetic energy (K.E.) of the proton would be \( K.E. = eV \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge. That makes sense.

Next, after being accelerated, the proton passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. Importantly, it's mentioned that the proton's trajectory isn't affected. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Why wouldn't the trajectory be affected? Normally, when a charged particle moves through both electric and magnetic fields, it experiences a combined force, so it should curve or something, right? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the electric field and magnetic field are such that they cancel each other out in some way, making the net force zero? Or maybe the proton's velocity is such that the forces balance each other. Let me think. The electric force is \( F_e = eE \) in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force is \( F_m = e(v \times B) \). Since B is in the +y-direction and the velocity is in the +z-direction after being accelerated, the cross product \( v \times B \) would be in the +x-direction because of the right-hand rule. So, \( F_m = e(vB \hat{i}) \).

So both the electric and magnetic forces are in the +x-direction? That would mean the total force is \( F = F_e + F_m = eE + e(vB) \). Hmm, so if both electric and magnetic fields are in +x, then the forces add up. But the problem says that the trajectory isn't affected. Maybe that's because the net force is zero? But how?

Wait, the initial velocity is in the +z-direction, so the magnetic force is in the +x-direction, while the electric force is also in the +x-direction. So both forces add up, pushing the proton more in the +x-direction. But the problem says the trajectory isn't affected. That seems contradictory. Maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that without the electric field, the magnetic field alone would make the proton curved, but with the electric field, it's somehow neutralizing that effect? Or maybe I need to consider the motion more carefully.

Wait, no. The potential difference gives the proton an initial velocity in the +z-direction. Then, when it enters the electric and magnetic fields, it has a velocity in the +z, so the magnetic force is in the +x, and the electric force is in the +x. So they add up, leading to an acceleration in the +x-direction. Therefore, the proton would be deflected in the +x-direction, which is option A.

But the problem says that the trajectory is not affected. Wait, maybe the initial velocity is zero, but wait, no, it's accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, so it does have a velocity. So the trajectory should be affected. Maybe the question is that the velocity is such that the net force is zero? Or perhaps the fields are too weak?

Wait, no, the fields are given as uniform E in +x and B in +y, so...

Let me think again. The electric force is \( F_e = eE \) in +x. The magnetic force is \( F_m = e(v \times B) \). Since velocity is in +z and B is in +y, the cross product \( v \times B \) is in +x. So \( F_m = e(vB)\hat{i} \). Therefore, both forces are in the same direction, so the net force is \( e(E + vB) \) in the +x-direction. Thus, the proton is accelerated in the +x-direction, which would cause a deflection in the +x-direction.

But the problem says the trajectory is not affected. Hmm, maybe it is affected, but the effect is not noticeable? Or perhaps the initial velocity is so high that the magnetic force is strong enough to cause a significant deflection? Or maybe I have to consider the motion over time.

Wait, perhaps the fields are such that the electric and magnetic forces cancel each other. Let me set \( E + vB = 0 \) for the net force. If that's the case, then \( E = -vB \). But the problem says E is in +x and B is in +y, so E would be negative in the +x direction. But the potential difference is positive, so E is in +x. So unless the velocity is opposite to E, but it's not. The velocity is in +z.

Wait, maybe it's a matter of units. Electric field is in volts per meter, and velocity is meters per second. So the magnetic force is \( F_m = e(v \times B) \), which is in newtons. Electric force is \( F_e = eE \), also in newtons. So unless E and \( vB \) are equal, the forces won't cancel. So if E = vB, then \( F_e = F_m \), and the net force is zero. But the problem says the trajectory is not affected, which would imply no deflection, but that's not consistent with the initial velocity.

Wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is that the electric force is opposite to the magnetic force? Or something else. Let me re-examine.

Electric field E is in +x, so force is \( F_e = eE \) in +x. Magnetic field B is in +y, so force is \( F_m = e(v \times B) \). If velocity is in +z, then cross product is +x, so same direction. Therefore, both forces are in +x, so net force is in +x. So the proton is accelerating in +x, causing it to move more in +x, which would make its trajectory curve in +x-direction.

Therefore, the proton is deflected in +x-direction, which is option A. So why the initial statement that the trajectory is not affected? Wait, maybe in the first case, with potential difference V, the electric field is E = (V / d), and the magnetic field is given, so the forces may not necessarily cancel.

Wait, perhaps because the initial velocity is in +z, and the magnetic force is in +x, and electric force is in +x. So they add up, giving a net force in +x. Therefore, the proton is deflected in +x, but maybe the deflection is small? Or maybe not. Hmm, I might need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the velocity is such that the magnetic force cancels the electric force. But unless the velocity is specifically set to that. Wait, but the problem just states that the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, so initial velocity is \( v = \sqrt{2eV/m} \) or something, depending on the mass. Hmm, but it's not clear whether \( vB = E \) or not.

Wait, but in the first case, the proton is deflected, but the problem says the trajectory is not affected. So maybe there is a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the electric field is such that it cancels the magnetic force.

Wait, if the electric field is in the opposite direction, then F_e would be in -x, and F_m is in +x, so net force would be zero. But the problem says E is in +x. Hmm, so maybe the velocity is such that \( vB = E \), making \( F_e + F_m = 0 \). So net force zero.

But wait, the problem says the proton is accelerated through a potential difference, so it has velocity in +z, so \( v = \sqrt{2eV/m} \). Then, if E is in +x, and B is in +y, then the magnetic force is in +x. If E is equal to \( e v B \), then F_e = F_m, so net force zero. But unless E is specifically set as such, I don't know.

Wait, perhaps regardless of the fields, the trajectory is not affected because the electric and magnetic fields are such that they cause the same deflection? Wait, maybe it's the initial velocity direction.

Wait, in any case, the problem says that when the potential difference is doubled, the trajectory is affected. So initially, with V, it's not affected, but with 2V, it is. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the initial velocity is zero before being accelerated? No, it's accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, so it has an initial velocity in +z.

Then, in the region with E and B, the electric force is in +x and the magnetic force is in +x, so net force is in +x, which would cause the proton to accelerate in +x, thus deflecting it in the +x direction.

But the problem says the trajectory is not affected. Maybe the proton continues in a straight line? Wait, that would be if the net force is zero. So perhaps E = -vB. But in this case, if E is in +x, and v is in +z, then B would have to be in -y direction to get E = -vB. But the problem states B is in +y, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I have the directions wrong. Let me write down the directions:

- Electric field, E: +x-direction.

- Magnetic field, B: +y-direction.

- Proton's velocity after acceleration: +z-direction.

So, the electric force on the proton is \( F_e = e E \) in +x.

The magnetic force is \( F_m = e (v \times B) \). Since v is +z and B is +y, the cross product \( v \times B \) is in the direction of +x (using right-hand rule: z cross y is x). So the magnetic force is +x.

Therefore, net force is \( F_e + F_m = eE + e(vB) \) in +x. So acceleration is in +x-direction.

Therefore, the proton is accelerating in +x-direction, which would cause it to deflect in +x-direction. But the problem says the trajectory is not affected. Hmm, so is this a trick question?

Wait, perhaps the region with E and B is such that the net force is zero. How? If E = -vB. If E is in the opposite direction, but the problem says E is in +x. Hmm, so unless the velocity is such that \( vB = -E \), but then the velocity would have to be in the opposite direction, but it's +z.

Wait, no. If E is in +x, and B is in +y, then \( v \times B \) is in +x, so the magnetic force is in +x, same as electric. So unless E is negative, they can't cancel. So maybe the problem is that the force is zero?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the proton is so large that the forces are negligible? But that doesn't make sense in a physics problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the proton's motion is only due to the electric field, and the magnetic field doesn't affect it? But that's not how it works. Magnetic fields do affect charged particles moving through them.

Wait, now I'm confused because my reasoning suggests that the proton should be deflected in +x, but the problem says the trajectory is not affected, implying no deflection. So something is wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the velocity is in +z, so the magnetic force is in +x, and electric force is in +x. So total force is +x, so it should accelerate in +x, causing it to deflect. So why is the trajectory not affected?

Wait, unless the magnetic field is uniform and the electric field is also uniform, but the motion is such that the proton continues straight? Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the magnetic field is too weak or something? No, the problem doesn't specify any particular strength.

Wait, unless the motion is in a region where the electric and magnetic fields are such that the net force is zero, but that would require E = -vB, which would mean that B is in -y, but the problem says it's in +y.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the initial velocity. The initial velocity is in +z, so the magnetic force is in +x, but the electric force is opposite, so E in -x. So if E is in -x, then net force is zero. But the problem says E is in +x.

Wait, now I'm really stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

Suppose the proton is moving in +z. Then, in the region with E and B, it's going to experience both electric and magnetic forces.

Electric force: \( F_e = eE \). Since E is in +x, \( F_e \) is in +x.

Magnetic force: \( F_m = e(v \times B) \). Since velocity is in +z and B is in +y, the cross product is +x, so \( F_m \) is in +x.

Thus, both forces are in +x, so the net force is \( e(E + vB) \) in +x.

Therefore, the proton accelerates in +x, which would make it deflect in +x-direction. So the correct answer would be A.

But the problem says that in the first case, the trajectory is not affected. That must mean that the net force is zero. So how?

Wait, unless the magnetic field is in -y direction, but the problem says it's in +y. Hmm, maybe the problem is that the electric and magnetic fields are arranged such that they cause a voltage that cancels each other?

Wait, no, that's about electric potential, not force.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocity is such that the electric and magnetic forces balance out. So \( E = -vB \). If that's the case, then net force is zero. But given that E is in +x, then \( -vB \) should be in +x, which would require B to be in -y direction. But the problem says B is in +y.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the key is that the electric field is in +x, so it causes a force in +x, but the magnetic field is in +y, so it causes a force in +x as well, so both add up. Therefore, the proton is deflected in +x.

But the problem says the trajectory is not affected, meaning no deflection. Hmm, perhaps if E is in +x and B is in +y, but the velocity is such that \( vB = E \), then they cancel. But E is given as uniform, so unless the velocity is set accordingly.

Wait, but the problem says the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, so it has an initial velocity of \( v = \sqrt{2eV/m} \). Therefore, unless E is equal to \( e v B \), the forces won't cancel.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state E and B are related in any way except their directions. So, in general, unless E = vB, the forces won't cancel. So unless the problem is that E is in +x, B is in +y, and the velocity is such that \( vB = E \), making net force zero.

But since the problem says the trajectory is not affected, implying no deflection, which would happen only if net force is zero. Therefore, perhaps in the first case, the potential difference V is such that E = vB. Then, doubling V would make E = 2vB, so net force would be in +x, causing a deflection.

Wait, that seems possible. Let me think again.

If the proton is accelerated through V, it gains a velocity v. The electric field E is in +x, and B is in +y, so the magnetic force is in +x. If E = vB, then net force is zero, so the trajectory isn't affected. But if the potential difference is doubled, so V becomes 2V, then the velocity becomes v' = sqrt(2e(2V)/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2eV/m) = sqrt(2) * v.

So, v' = sqrt(2) v.

Now, magnetic force is e(v' B) = e v B sqrt(2).

Electric field E is still in +x, so E = eV/d or something? Wait, no, E is given as uniform in +x.

Wait, actually, the electric field E is created by the potential difference V. So E = V/d, where d is the distance over which the potential difference is applied.

But in the problem, we are only told that E is in +x. So the initial acceleration happens over some distance, giving the proton a velocity in +z, and then it enters the region with E in +x and B in +y.

So, in the first case, with potential V, E = V/d. The proton's velocity is v = sqrt(2eV/m). Then, the magnetic force is F_m = e(vB) in +x.

If E = vB, then F_e = F_m, so net force is zero. Therefore, the proton doesn't deflect. But if E ≠ vB, then it does deflect.

Wait, but the problem says that the trajectory is not affected, so net force is zero, which would require E = vB. So, if E = vB, then with potential difference V, E = V/d and v = sqrt(2eV/m), so V/d = sqrt(2eV/m) * B.

So, solving for V:

V/d = sqrt(2eV/m) * B.

Wait, but unless B is given in terms of V, which
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is that the proton gets deflected in the +x-direction when the potential difference is doubled. Let me go through it step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. The setup is: a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. After that, it passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. Despite these fields, the proton’s trajectory isn't affected. Then, if we repeat the experiment with a potential difference of 2V instead of V, the proton will be deflected in some direction, and the options are about which direction it would be deflected.

Hmm, wait. The first part says the trajectory isn't affected by the electric and magnetic fields. That's a bit confusing because usually, when you have electric and magnetic fields, they can influence charged particles like protons. So why isn't the trajectory affected initially?

Let me think. The proton is accelerated through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. That means it gains some kinetic energy, and its velocity will be in the +z-direction because the electric field from the potential difference is also in the +z-direction. So before entering the region with the electric and magnetic fields, the proton is moving along +z with some velocity.

Now, after that, the proton enters a region with an electric field E in the +x-direction and a magnetic field B in the +y-direction. I need to figure out if these fields will cause any deflection.

I remember that when a charged particle enters a region with both electric and magnetic fields, the total force on it is the sum of the electric force and the magnetic force. The magnetic force is given by F_m = q(v × B), and the electric force is F_e = qE.

In this case, the proton is moving with velocity v (from the potential difference acceleration) in the +z-direction. The electric field E is in the +x-direction, and the magnetic field B is in the +y-direction. So the electric force would push the proton in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force would push it in the direction determined by the cross product of v and B.

Let me write this down:

Electric force: F_e = qE (since E is in +x, force direction is +x)

Magnetic force: F_m = q(v × B). Velocity v is in +z, B is in +y. So cross product z × y.

Wait, cross product of z and y. Let me recall the right-hand rule. Point index finger in direction of z (up), middle finger in direction of y (left), then the thumb points in the direction of z × y, which is -x. So F_m is in the -x direction.

Therefore, the magnetic force is in -x, and the electric force is in +x. So the net force is F_total = F_e + F_m = qE - q(v × B). But actually, in vector terms, since E is in +x and F_m is in -x, they subtract.

So the net force is in the direction of E minus the magnetic component. But wait, which one is bigger? That depends on the magnitudes of E and v × B.

Hold on, the problem says that the trajectory is not affected, which implies that the net force is zero. So F_e + F_m = 0, meaning that the electric and magnetic forces cancel each other out. Therefore, E must be equal in magnitude to the magnetic force, but opposite in direction.

Wait, so E must be equal to (v × B) in magnitude? Let me clarify.

The electric field is E, and the magnetic force is q(v × B). So for these forces to cancel, we must have E = (v × B). But the direction matters too. Since F_e is +x and F_m is -x, we must have E = (v × B). Let me compute (v × B):

v is in +z, B is in +y, so v × B is z × y = -x (as before). So E must be pointing in the -x direction for the forces to cancel. But the problem says the electric field is in the +x direction. That contradicts, unless E is in the -x direction.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The proton is moving in the +z direction. The magnetic force is F_m = q(v × B). v is +z, B is +y. So v × B is -x, as I thought. So F_m is in the -x direction.

The electric field E is in the +x direction, so F_e is in +x. Therefore, F_total = F_e + F_m = qE (in +x) + q(-E') (in -x), so net force is zero only if E = E', but here E is in +x and F_m is in -x.

Wait, perhaps the magnitude is equal? If E is equal to the magnitude of (v × B), then F_total is zero, but that would mean the electric field is in -x, which contradicts the given +x.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the Lorentz force equation again. The total force is F = q(E + v × B). So in this case, E is in +x, v is in +z, B is in +y.

So v × B is (-x). So F = q( E (+x) + (-x) ). Therefore, total force is q( E - v × B ) in the +x direction.

Wait, but the problem says that the trajectory isn't affected, so F must be zero.

Therefore, E must be in the direction opposite to v × B.

Wait, but v × B is (-x), so E must be in +x to cancel it? But then, F = q( E (+x) + (-x) ) = q( E - E ) = 0.

But E is in +x, and (-x) is from the cross product. So yes, E (+x) cancels (-x), so F_total is zero.

Wait, but (-x) is the direction from the cross product. So F_m = q(-x), and F_e = q(+x). So they cancel each other. So the net force is zero. Therefore, the proton is not deflected.

So this is why the trajectory isn't affected—the electric force and magnetic force cancel each other out.

Alright, so now, in the original experiment, with potential difference V, the proton is moving in +z and then enters E (+x) and B (+y), which causes the electric and magnetic forces to cancel. Therefore, no deflection.

Now, in the experiment where the potential difference is 2V instead of V. Let me think. If the potential difference is doubled, the initial kinetic energy of the proton doubles, so its velocity after acceleration is higher.

Wait, but does the velocity direction change? No, it's still accelerated in the +z-direction, so velocity is still in +z. The only change is the magnitude of velocity, i.e., v becomes 2v (assuming linear relation; actually, since energy is quadratic, it's sqrt(2V) times the original velocity, but maybe we can approximate it as 2v for simplicity).

Wait, but the electric and magnetic fields are the same as before: E is still in +x, B is still in +y.

So then, the electric force is qE in +x, and the magnetic force is q(v × B) in -x.

But now, v is larger—does that affect the direction? No, the direction depends on the cross product, which is still (-x). So the magnetic force is still in -x.

But now, the electric force is qE, and the magnetic force is q(-E') where E' is the magnitude of (v × B). But here, v is larger, so E' = v × B is larger.

Wait, let me think. If E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, then the net force is q(E - (v × B)). If (v × B) is larger, then net force is in the -x direction.

Wait, but in the original case, with velocity v, (v × B) was equal in magnitude to E, because they canceled each other. So when the velocity is doubled, (2v × B) is twice as big. So E would have to be twice as big to cancel it, but in the problem, E remains the same, because the region is with uniform E in +x and B in +y.

Therefore, with velocity 2v, (v × B) is doubled, but E is still same. So E is now smaller than (v × B). Therefore, net force is q(E - (v × B)) = q( E - 2E )? Wait, no.

Wait, E is in +x, and (v × B) is in -x. So if (v × B) is 2E', then net force is q(E + (-2E'))? Wait, no, E is in +x, (v × B) is in -x.

So let me write it as:

F_total = q(E + (v × B)) = q(E + (-E')).

Wait, but E in magnitude: E = (v × B) in magnitude.

In the original case, F_total = 0.

Now, if velocity is doubled, then (v × B) is doubled in magnitude, so E is still the same as before. Therefore, E is smaller than (v × B). Therefore, F_total = q(E - (v × B)) where the direction is +x minus ( -x )? Wait, no.

Wait, let me define directions:

E is in +x, so E = +Ex.

v × B is in -x, so (v × B) = -Bx.

Therefore, F_total = q(E + (v × B)) = q(Ex - Bx).

Wait, but earlier, when v was v0, we had E = Bx, so Ex - Bx = 0, F_total = 0.

But now, with v = 2v0, (v × B) = 2(v0 × B) = -2Bx. So F_total = q(Ex - 2Bx).

But since E was set to cancel v × B when v was v0, E = Bx.

So now, E = Bx, but (v × B) is -2Bx. Therefore, F_total = q(Bx - 2Bx) = q(-Bx) = -qBx.

So the net force is in the -x direction. Therefore, the proton is deflected in the -x direction.

Wait, but that contradicts the initial statement. The problem says that with 2V, the proton would then be... and the answer is A, deflected in +x.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the direction.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe if velocity is increased, but E is increased as well?

Wait, no—the problem states that the electric field E and magnetic field B remain the same as before. So E is still in +x, same magnitude as before. But v is doubled, so the cross product v × B is doubled in magnitude, but direction unchanged.

So, in the original case:

F_total = q(E - (v × B)) = 0.

In the new case, v is doubled, so F_total = q(E - 2(v × B)) = q(E - 2*(-E)) = q(E + 2E) = q(3E) in the +x direction.

Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the direction.

Wait, (v × B) is in -x, so 2*(v × B) is -2x. So E is +x, so E + 2*(v × B) = E + (-2x). If E was equal to v × B before, then E was equal to (v × B). So E was equal to (v × B), which is -x. Wait, no, that can't be. Because E is in +x, so E = |v × B|.

Wait, I think I need to clarify with a sign.

Let me assign coordinates:

- Let’s say E is in +x: E = (E, 0, 0).

- B is in +y: B = (0, B, 0).

- Velocity v is in +z: v = (0, 0, v).

Then, v × B = |i j k; 0 0 v; 0 B 0| = (0*B - v*0)i - (0*0 - v*0)j + (0*0 - 0*0)k = 0i - 0j + 0k? Wait, no.

Wait, cross product of z and y.

Wait, i x j = k, j x k = i, k x i = j.

Wait, the cross product of z (which is the unit vector along k) and y (unit vector along j) is k × j. Since cross product is anti-commutative, j × k = i. So k × j = -i.

Therefore, v × B = (v in z) × (B in y) = (-x direction). So v × B is -x.

Thus, F_magnetic = q(v × B) = -qE, assuming E = |v × B|.

Wait, maybe not. Let me see:

Wait, F_magnetic = q(v × B). If v is in +z and B is in +y, then v × B is in -x. So F_magnetic is in -x.

E is in +x, so F_electric is in +x.

In the original case, F_total = F_electric + F_magnetic = qE - qE = 0.

So no deflection.

Now, when the potential difference is doubled, the proton is accelerated to a higher velocity in +z. So v becomes larger.

Therefore, v × B is now -2E (assuming E was equal to the original |v × B|, but actually, v is doubled, so |v × B| is doubled, but since E is fixed, now E < |v × B|.

Wait, hold on. Let me denote:

In the original case: E = |v × B|.

So F_total = q(E - (v × B)) = q(E - (-E)) = q(2E). Wait, but that can't be because F_total would be 2qE in +x, but the problem said the trajectory isn't affected, implying F_total = 0.

Wait, this is confusing me. Let me clarify with variables.

Let me denote:

Electric field: E = (E, 0, 0).

Magnetic field: B = (0, B, 0).

Velocity: v = (0, 0, v).

Magnetic force: F_m = q(v × B) = q( (0, 0, v) × (0, B, 0) ) = q( (0*v - v*0, v*0 - 0*0, 0*0 - 0*0 ) )? Wait, no.

Wait, cross product of z and y. As before, z × y = -x. So F_m = q(-x).

Electric force: F_e = qE in +x.

Therefore, F_total = qE - qE = 0.

Wait, so in the original case, F_total is zero.

In the new case, v is doubled, so v = 2v. So F_m = q(-2x). E is same, so F_e = qE.

Therefore, F_total = qE - 2qE = -qE in -x.

So the net force is in the -x direction, meaning the proton is deflected in the -x direction.

But the answer is supposed to be A: deflected in +x.

Wait, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps when the potential difference is doubled, the kinetic energy is doubled, so the velocity is higher, but also, the electric field is somehow doubled? No, the problem says the region has uniform electric field E in +x, which is same as before.

Wait, let me think again. If the proton is accelerated through 2V, its kinetic energy is higher, so its velocity is higher. The initial velocity is higher, so when it enters the E and B fields, the magnetic force is stronger.

Since v is higher, (v × B) is larger in magnitude, so the magnetic force is larger, but E is the same. Therefore, the electric force is qE in +x, magnetic force is q( -2E) in -x, so net force is -qE in -x.

Therefore, the proton is deflected in -x.

But the answer is supposed to be +x. So maybe I got the direction wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the cross product, I messed up the direction.

Wait, let's define the coordinate system again.

Assume:

- +z is up.

- The proton is accelerated through +V, so velocity is in +z.

- Electric field E is in +x.

- Magnetic field B is in +y.

Cross product v × B: z × y = -x. So F_m = q(-x).

Therefore, total force is q(E) (+x) + q(-E) (-x). So if E = E, then F_total = 0.

But when velocity is 2v, E is same, so F_m = q(-2E). So F_total = q(E) + q(-2E) = -qE in -x.

So the proton is deflected in -x direction.

But the answer is supposed to be +x.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the cross product.

Wait, cross product is anti-commutative. So if v is in +z and B is in +y, then v × B is -x. So F_m = q(-x). Correct.

But if E is in +x, then F_e is +x.

So in original:

F_m = -q E_x
[overthinking]
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is: A. deflected in the +x-direction?"

Hmm. So, the setup is that a proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, giving it some kinetic energy. Then, it goes into a region with electric and magnetic fields. But despite these fields, the trajectory isn't affected. That's interesting. So, maybe the electric and magnetic fields are arranged in such a way that their forces cancel out, leading to no deflection? But then, if we change the potential difference to 2V, the trajectory would be affected, meaning the net force isn't zero anymore.

Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the proton starts at rest and is accelerated through a potential difference V. The potential difference V will accelerate the proton, giving it kinetic energy. The energy gained can be calculated using the equation:

\( K = eV \)

Where \( K \) is the kinetic energy, \( e \) is the charge of the proton, and \( V \) is the potential difference. For a proton, \( e = +e \), so the proton will have a positive charge.

So, the proton is moving in the +z-direction after being accelerated. That means its initial velocity is in the +z direction.

Next, the proton enters a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The key point here is that despite these fields, the trajectory isn't affected. That implies that the net force on the proton is zero in that region.

But wait, the electric field E is in the +x-direction. The magnetic field B is in the +y-direction. So, the electric force \( F_e = eE \) would be in the +x-direction, and the magnetic force \( F_m = e(v \times B) \) would be in some direction depending on the velocity.

But the proton is moving in the +z direction. So, let's compute the magnetic force.

The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by the Lorentz force law:

\( F = e(v \times B) \)

Since the velocity is in the +z direction and the magnetic field is in the +y direction, the cross product \( v \times B \) is in the direction perpendicular to both z and y, which is the -x direction. So, the magnetic force is in the -x direction.

So, the electric force is +x, the magnetic force is -x. If these forces are equal in magnitude, the net force is zero, meaning the proton isn't deflected. Therefore, for the proton's trajectory not to be affected, the electric and magnetic forces must cancel each other out.

So, from the electric force: \( F_e = eE \) in the +x direction.

From the magnetic force: \( F_m = e(v \times B) \) in the -x direction.

Setting them equal in magnitude:

\( eE = e(v \times B) \)

Which simplifies to:

\( E = vB \)

But wait, what is \( v \) at the point where the proton enters the electric and magnetic fields?

The proton was accelerated through a potential difference V, so its kinetic energy is \( K = eV \), and since the motion is in the +z direction, we can relate this to its velocity.

The kinetic energy for a proton is also given by:

\( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)

Where \( m \) is the mass of the proton. So, we can solve for \( v \):

\( v = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} \)

Therefore, the velocity \( v \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{V} \).

From the earlier equation \( E = vB \), if the electric and magnetic fields are arranged such that the forces cancel out, then:

\( E = vB \)

So, if we change the potential difference to 2V, the velocity \( v' \) would be:

\( v' = \sqrt{\frac{2e(2V)}{m}} = \sqrt{2} \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}} = \sqrt{2} v \)

So, the new velocity is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the original velocity.

But the electric field E and the magnetic field B are presumably constant, right? Because the problem says "a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction." It doesn't mention these fields changing.

Wait, if E and B are fixed, then if the proton's velocity increases, the magnetic force would be \( F_m = e(v' \times B) \). Let's compute this.

Original force from magnetic field was \( F_m = e(v \times B) = -e v B \) in the -x direction.

But now, the velocity is \( v' = \sqrt{2} v \), so the magnetic force is \( F_m' = e(v' \times B) = -e (\sqrt{2} v) B \) which is \( -\sqrt{2} e v B \), still in the -x direction.

However, the electric force is still \( F_e = e E = e (v B) \) because E and B are the same. So, wait, now the electric force is \( e v B \) in the +x direction, and the magnetic force is \( -\sqrt{2} e v B \) in the -x direction.

So, the net force is now \( F_{net} = e v B - \sqrt{2} e v B = e v B (1 - \sqrt{2}) \), which is in the +x direction because \( (1 - \sqrt{2}) \) is negative, but the force direction depends on the sign.

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Electric force is +x: \( +e E = +e v B \)

Magnetic force is -x: \( -e (\sqrt{2} v) B \)

So, the net force is \( e v B - e \sqrt{2} v B = e v B (1 - \sqrt{2}) \). So, since \( (1 - \sqrt{2}) \) is negative, the net force is in the negative x-direction.

Wait, that would mean that the proton is deflected in the negative x-direction.

But the problem says that when the potential difference is doubled, the trajectory would be affected. Originally, when V was used, the net force was zero, so no deflection. But with 2V, the net force is non-zero.

Wait, hold on. Maybe my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, initially, the net force was zero because \( F_e = -F_m \), so the proton wasn't deflected. So, E = v B.

But if we change the potential difference, the velocity v changes. So, if V is doubled, the velocity is increased by sqrt(2). So, if E and B remain the same, then v B increases, so E would have to increase to keep E = v B. But in the problem statement, it's not specified whether E and B are changed or not.

Wait, the problem states that the proton passes through a region with uniform E and B fields, so I think E and B are fixed for the region. So, if E and B are fixed, and only the potential difference is changed, then the velocity v increases.

So, initially, with V, we had E = v B. Now, with 2V, the velocity becomes v' = sqrt(2) v, which is higher.

So, if E and B are fixed, then the electric force is \( e E = e v B \) (same as before, since E = v B). The magnetic force is \( e (v' \times B) = e (v' B) \) in the -x direction.

Wait, but now, the velocity is higher, so v' B is larger.

So, the magnetic force is larger in magnitude than the electric force, and it's in the -x direction. So, the net force is \( F_{net} = e E - e v' B = e v B - e v' B = e B (v - v') \). Since \( v' > v \), this is negative, meaning the force is in the -x direction.

Wait, that would mean that the proton is deflected in the -x direction. But the answer is supposed to be +x.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the initial condition is that the electric and magnetic forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so net force zero. Therefore, E = v B. So, if V increases, velocity increases by sqrt(2), so E must have been equal to v B = sqrt(2) E. But E is fixed. So, if E and B are fixed, increasing V would make v larger, so E would have to be larger, but in the problem, E and B are given as fixed.

Wait, maybe my initial understanding is flawed. Let's visualize this.

The proton is moving in +z direction. It enters a region with E in +x and B in +y.

Electric force is F_e = e E in +x.

Magnetic force is F_m = e (v × B). Since v is +z, B is +y, so v × B is +z × +y = +x. Wait, is that right? Let me think.

Wait, cross product of z and y.

Standard basis vectors: x × y = +z, y × z = +x, z × x = +y.

Wait, but the cross product is anti-commutative: a × b = -b × a.

So, if v is +z, and B is +y, then v × B is +z × +y = ?

Wait, let me think: z × y is -x.

Wait, cross product: i × j = k, j × k = i, k × i = j.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, in standard right-hand coordinate system:

i × j = k,

j × k = i,

k × i = j.

So, if v is in the +z direction, which is k, and B is in +y direction, which is j.

Then, v × B = k × j = - (j × k) = -i.

So, v × B is -i, which is -x.

Thus, F_m = e (v × B) = -e x.

So, magnetic force is -x.

Electric force is +x.

So, if |F_e| = |F_m|, then F_net = 0, and no deflection.

So, when the proton is accelerated through V, it gains velocity v, such that E = v B.

Thus, E = v B.

Now, if V is doubled to 2V, the proton's velocity becomes higher.

v' = sqrt(2) v.

But E and B are still the same, so E = v' B' ?

Wait, no, E is fixed, so if v' = sqrt(2) v, then E = v B implies that E = sqrt(2) v B.

But E was originally equal to v B.

So, if E is fixed, then E = v B, and now, if v increases, B must decrease, but the problem says the magnetic field is in +y direction, so maybe B is fixed as well.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify if B is changed or not. It just mentions that when the proton passes through the region with E and B fields, the trajectory isn't affected. So, for that particular case, when the proton is at velocity v, E and B are arranged so that E = v B, causing the net force to be zero.

But when the proton is accelerated through a larger potential difference, 2V, it has velocity v', which is sqrt(2) v.

If E and B are fixed, then with v' = sqrt(2) v, the magnetic force becomes e (v' × B) = -e v' B = -e sqrt(2) v B.

And the electric force is still e E = e v B, same as before.

So, net force F_net = e v B - e sqrt(2) v B = e v B (1 - sqrt(2)).

Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, 1 - sqrt(2) is approximately -0.414, so the net force is negative, meaning in the -x direction.

But the answer is supposed to be +x direction, which is option A.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, let's go back.

The electric force is in +x, the magnetic force is in -x. So, net force is F_e - F_m.

If initially, F_e = F_m, net force is zero.

If the velocity increases, but E and B remain the same, then F_e remains the same, but F_m increases because velocity is higher.

So, if F_m becomes larger than F_e, then net force is in the -x direction.

Thus, the proton would be deflected in the -x direction.

But the problem says that when using 2V, the trajectory is affected, so the net force is non-zero.

But the answer is supposed to be +x.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the magnetic force.

Wait, cross product: v is in +z, B is in +y.

v × B is z × y = -x.

But force is e(v × B), so it's -e x.

Electric force is +e x.

So, net force is e x - e x = 0.

If V is doubled, velocity is higher, so v × B is more negative.

So, magnetic force is more negative, so net force is e x - (more e x) = negative x.

So, deflection in -x.

But answer is supposed to be +x. I'm definitely missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the direction of B is different?

Wait, in the problem, B is in +y direction.

Alternatively, maybe both E and B are in the same direction, but in a different configuration?

Wait, let's think in terms of equations of motion.

The Lorentz force equation is:

dP/dt = q(E + v × B)

Since the proton is charged, q = e.

So, the proton's acceleration is a = e(E + v × B).

So, in the initial case, the acceleration is zero because E and v × B are opposite in direction and equal in magnitude. So, a = 0.

Then, when the potential difference is doubled, the velocity becomes higher, and E is fixed. So, the acceleration is a = e(E + v × B). Since E is fixed, and v × B is now more negative (since v is higher), so the acceleration is in the -x direction.

Therefore, the proton will start deflecting in the -x direction.

But the answer is supposed to be +x. That's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I've messed up the direction of the velocity.

Wait, the proton is moving in +z direction. So, v is in +z.

B is in +y.

v × B is z × y = -x.

So, magnetic force is -e x.

Electric force is +e x.

Net force is zero.

If V is increased, so velocity is higher, so v is higher, so v × B is more negative, hence F_m is more negative, so net force is negative, -x direction.

So, the proton is deflected in -x direction.

But according to the question, the correct answer is +x direction.

So, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the acceleration is not only due to E and B, but also the initial velocity.

Wait, maybe the motion is a combination of velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial acceleration through the potential difference gives the proton not only kinetic energy but also some velocity in another direction?

Wait, no, the potential difference accelerates the proton along the direction of the electric field. If the electric field is in +x, it would accelerate in +x. But in this case, the electric field is in +x, but the proton's trajectory is not affected, so maybe the electric field is actually not along +x?

Wait, the problem says the electric field is in +x, but the proton's trajectory is not affected. So, in the region of E and B, the net force is zero.

Which would mean that E = v B.

So, from rest, the proton is accelerated through V, so it gains kinetic energy, which gives it velocity v.

Then, in the E and B fields, the electric force is +x, and the magnetic force is -x, so they balance.

Now, if V is doubled, so kinetic energy doubles, so velocity increases.

Since E and B are fixed, the magnetic force increases, but the electric force stays the same.

Therefore, net force becomes F_net = e E - e (sqrt(2) v B) = e (E - sqrt(2) v B)

But originally, E = v B, so now, E - sqrt(2) v B = v B (1 - sqrt(2)) which is negative, so net force is -x.

Therefore, the proton is deflected in -x direction.

But according to the problem, the answer is supposed to be +x.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the initial acceleration is in +z, so the proton's velocity is in +z, but the E field is in +x and B is in +y.

So, the initial motion is in +z, but in the region of E and
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a proton moving in electric and magnetic fields, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is that the proton is deflected in the +x-direction when the potential difference is increased to 2V. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. So, initially, the proton is at rest, and then it's given some kinetic energy due to the electric potential. Since the acceleration is in the +z-direction, the proton's initial velocity after this acceleration should also be in the +z-direction. I remember that when a charge moves through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy, and the direction of the velocity is the same as the direction of the electric field. So, that part makes sense.

Now, moving on, after being accelerated, the proton passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The question says that the proton's trajectory is not affected. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in this region with E and B fields, the proton doesn't deflect. I need to figure out why that is.

I recall that when a charged particle moves through electric and magnetic fields, it experiences Lorentz forces. The electric force is F_e = q(E + v × B), and the magnetic force is F_m = q(v × B). So, the total force on the proton is the sum of these two. Since the trajectory isn't affected, that must mean the net force on the proton is zero. So, the electric force and the magnetic force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me write down the expressions:

F_total = qE + q(v × B) = 0

So, qE = -q(v × B)

Since the proton's charge q is not zero, we can divide both sides by q:

E = -(v × B)

That gives us a vector equation. Let me think about the directions here. The electric field E is in the +x-direction, so E = (E, 0, 0) in a coordinate system. The magnetic field B is in the +y-direction, so B = (0, B, 0).

The velocity vector v of the proton is in the +z-direction, so v = (0, 0, v_z). Now, let's compute the cross product v × B.

v × B = (0, 0, v_z) × (0, B, 0) = (B*v_z, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0) = (B*v_z, 0, 0). Wait, no, cross product in determinant form is:

|i    j    k|
|0    0  v_z|
|0    B    0|

Which is i*(0*0 - v_z*B) - j*(0*0 - v_z*0) + k*(0*B - 0*0) = (-B v_z, 0, 0). So, v × B = (-B v_z, 0, 0).

So, the magnetic force is F_m = q(v × B) = q*(-B v_z, 0, 0) = (-q B v_z, 0, 0).

The electric field is E = (E, 0, 0). So, the electric force is F_e = qE = (q E, 0, 0).

Since the net force is zero, F_e + F_m = 0. So,

(q E, 0, 0) + (-q B v_z, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0)

Therefore, q E - q B v_z = 0 => E = B v_z.

So, E = B v_z.

Now, I should also relate the initial acceleration of the proton through the potential difference V to its velocity. The proton starts from rest, so its initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2. The work done by the electric field is qV. So, (1/2)mv^2 = qV.

Hence, v = sqrt(2qV/m).

So, v_z = sqrt(2qV/m).

Therefore, from the earlier equation E = B v_z, we have:

E = B * sqrt(2qV/m)

But in the problem statement, the potential difference was V, and the electric field is E in the +x-direction, so E is fixed? Wait, no, the problem says that when the potential difference is changed to 2V, the proton's trajectory is affected. Hmm.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

"A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction."

Wait, so initially, the proton is accelerated through V, giving it velocity v_z. Then, it enters E and B fields, but the trajectory is not affected, meaning no deflection, which implies F_total = 0 as we had before. So, E = B v_z.

But when the potential difference is changed to 2V, the velocity of the proton becomes v' = sqrt(2q(2V)/m) = sqrt(2qV/m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2). So, the velocity increases by a factor of sqrt(2).

Now, with the same E and B fields, but higher velocity, would the force balance still hold?

Wait, E and B fields are presumably fixed in the region. So, was E = B v_z only in the initial case? Because when the velocity changes, E is still E, so E = B v' would not hold, meaning that the net force becomes non-zero.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Originally, with potential V, the proton's velocity is v_z = sqrt(2 q V / m). So, E = B v_z.

If the potential is changed to 2V, then the velocity becomes v'_z = sqrt(2 q (2V) / m) = sqrt(2 q V / m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2). So, now, E is still E, so E = B v'_z = B v_z * sqrt(2). But E is fixed, so B would adjust accordingly? Wait, no, the problem states that the proton passes through the same E and B fields. Wait, so E and B are fixed, but if the velocity changes, then E = B v' would not hold anymore.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The original setup: E in +x, B in +y, and the proton's motion is in +z, with E and B such that the net force is zero. So, E = B v_z.

If the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the velocity increases to sqrt(2 q (2V)/m) = sqrt(2 q V / m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2). Therefore, E = B v_z is no longer true because E is fixed, and B is fixed.

Therefore, E = B v' implies E / B = v', but since E and B are fixed, v' is determined by E / B. But in reality, the velocity is also determined by the kinetic energy from the potential difference, which was initially v_z = sqrt(2 q V / m). So, when we change V to 2V, the velocity would be higher, but E and B are fixed, so the net force isn't zero anymore. So, the proton will be deflected.

But which direction?

Hmm, so when the velocity increases, the magnetic force and electric force would no longer balance each other. Let me compute the new forces.

Original case: F_e = q E, F_m = q(v × B). Since E and B are in +x and +y, respectively, and velocity is +z, the cross product v × B is (-B v_z, 0, 0). So, F_m = -q B v_z in the -x direction.

So, F_e + F_m = q E - q B v_z = 0 => E = B v_z.

In the new case, the velocity is sqrt(2 q (2V) / m) = sqrt(2 q V / m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2).

So, E is still E, so E = B v_z, but now, v_z' = v_z * sqrt(2). So, E = B v_z' implies E = B v_z * sqrt(2). Therefore, E / B = v_z * sqrt(2).

But originally, E / B = v_z. So, now, E / B = v_z * sqrt(2) => v_z' = E / (B sqrt(2)).

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's compute the forces.

In the new case, velocity is higher, so F_e = q E, F_m = q(v × B). Let's compute the direction.

Again, E is in +x, v is in +z, B is in +y.

v × B = (0, 0, v_z) × (0, B, 0) = (B v_z, 0, 0) [Wait, no. Wait, cross product in components:

i component: 0*0 - v_z*B = -B v_z

j component: v_z*0 - 0*0 = 0

k component: 0*B - 0*0 = 0

Wait, so v × B = (-B v_z, 0, 0). So, F_m = q*(-B v_z, 0, 0) = (-q B v_z, 0, 0). So, direction is -x.

F_e is q E in +x direction.

So, net force is F_total = (q E, 0, 0) + (-q B v_z, 0, 0) = (q (E - B v_z), 0, 0).

Now, was E = B v_z in the original case? Yes, because the force was zero.

In the new case, if V is doubled, velocity is v' = sqrt(2 q (2V)/m) = sqrt(2 q V / m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2).

But E and B are fixed, so E = B v_z still holds in the original case, but in the new case, E = B v' would not hold. So, E - B v' = E - B v_z * sqrt(2). Since E = B v_z, E - B v_z * sqrt(2) = B v_z (1 - sqrt(2)).

Therefore, E - B v_z * sqrt(2) is negative because sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 1 - sqrt(2) is negative.

Therefore, F_total = (q (E - B v'), 0, 0) = (q (negative number), 0, 0). So, the net force is in the -x direction.

Wait, that suggests the proton would be deflected in the -x direction. But the problem says that when the potential difference is increased to 2V, the proton would then be deflected in the +x-direction. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check my cross product. If velocity is in +z and B is in +y, then v × B is in which direction? Let's recall the right-hand rule. If I point my index finger in +z and my middle finger in +y, then my thumb points in the direction of v × B. But +z is up, +y is left, so the cross product would be towards me, which is -x. So, yes, v × B is in -x direction.

So, the magnetic force is -x, and the electric force is +x. If E = B v_z initially, they cancel.

But when we double V, velocity becomes v' = v_z * sqrt(2). Therefore, E = B v_z, which was the original balance, but now, E = B v_z and v' = v_z sqrt(2). So, E = B v_z, but v' = B v_z sqrt(2). Therefore, E = v' * (B / sqrt(2)).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute the force with the new velocity.

F_e = q E = (q E, 0, 0)

F_m = q (v × B) = q (-B v_z, 0, 0) = (-q B v_z, 0, 0)

Now, with the new velocity, v_z' = sqrt(2 q (2V)/m) = sqrt(2 q V / m) * sqrt(2) = v_z * sqrt(2).

So, F_m = (-q B v_z * sqrt(2), 0, 0)

F_e = (q E, 0, 0)

Now, in the original case, E = B v_z, so E = B v_z => q E = q B v_z, which equals F_e. So, F_e = F_m. Therefore, net force is zero.

In the new case, E is still E = B v_z, but v_z' = v_z sqrt(2). So, F_e = q E = q B v_z.

F_m = -q B v_z sqrt(2).

So, net force F_total = q B v_z - q B v_z sqrt(2) = q B v_z (1 - sqrt(2)).

Since sqrt(2) is about 1.414, 1 - sqrt(2) is negative. Therefore, net force is in the -x direction.

Wait, that suggests that the proton would be deflected in the -x direction, but the question says the correct answer is A, deflected in +x. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the direction of the velocity.

Wait, the proton is accelerated through V in the +z-direction, so its velocity is in +z. Then, it enters E in +x and B in +y. But perhaps the velocity is in -z? Wait, no, because it's accelerated from rest through a potential difference, so it gains velocity in the direction of the electric field. So, if the potential difference is in +z, the velocity is +z.

Alternatively, maybe the electric field is in -x? Wait, no, the problem says E is in +x.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the right-hand rule. Let me double-check.

If velocity is +z and B is +y, then v × B is pointing in which direction?

Using the right-hand rule: point fingers in +z, bend towards +y. The palm faces +x. So, yes, the thumb is in +x? Wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait, the cross product v × B. If I have vectors along +z and +y, then the cross product is along +x? Wait, no.

Wait, i × j = k, j × k = i, k × i = j. So, if v is along +z (which is k) and B is along +y (which is j), then v × B is k × j = - (j × k) = -i. So, v × B is -i, which is -x direction. So, yes, the magnetic force is -x.

So, with E in +x, F_e is +x, F_m is -x.

In the initial case, they cancel because E = B v_z.

In the new case, since velocity is higher, F_m is stronger in the -x direction, so net force is -x.

But the problem says when the potential difference is increased, the proton would be deflected in +x. Hmm, so that contradicts my conclusion.

Wait, maybe I messed up the force directions.

Wait, electric field is E in +x, so the electric force on positive charge is +x.

Magnetic field is B in +y, so the magnetic force is v × B. Velocity is +z, so v × B is (-B v_z, 0, 0). So, magnetic force is in -x.

So, net force is (q E, 0, 0) + (-q B v_z, 0, 0) = (q(E - B v_z), 0, 0).

Originally, E = B v_z, so net force is zero.

When V is doubled, velocity is higher: v' = v_z * sqrt(2).

So, E is still E = B v_z, so E - B v' = E - B v_z sqrt(2). Since E = B v_z, the difference is E - B v_z sqrt(2) = B v_z (1 - sqrt(2)).

Therefore, E - B v' is negative, so net force is in -x direction.

Wait, but the problem says when V is doubled, the proton would be deflected in the +x-direction. So, either my reasoning is wrong, or perhaps the fields are being adjusted?

Wait, maybe the problem is not that E and B are fixed, but that the magnetic and electric fields are always such that E = B v_z, regardless of the velocity? That doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps when the potential difference is doubled, the velocity is higher, so in the same E and B fields, the magnetic force is stronger relative to electric force.

Wait, but if E and B were such that E = B v_z, then when velocity increases, E would have to change proportionally to keep the balance. But in the problem, E and B are fixed, because the region's fields are fixed
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton moving through electric and magnetic fields. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Okay, the problem says: A proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. Then it passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. Despite these fields, the proton's trajectory isn't affected. Then, if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, the proton would be deflected how? The options are A to D, with the correct answer being A, deflected in the +x-direction.

Hmm, let me parse this.

First, the proton starts from rest, so its initial kinetic energy is zero. It's accelerated through a potential difference V in the +z-direction. That means a charge q (which is positive for protons) is accelerated by the electric field. The energy gained should be qV, right? So the proton's kinetic energy is now (1/2)mv² = qV. That makes sense.

Now, the proton then enters a region with electric field E in the +x-direction and magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The problem states that the trajectory isn't affected, which is interesting. So normally, when a charged particle enters an electric and magnetic field region, it experiences a Lorentz force: F = q(E + v × B). If the trajectory isn't affected, that must mean the force is zero. So E + v × B = 0.

Let me write that down: E + v × B = 0. Therefore, v × B = -E.

Wait, so the velocity v is such that when you take the cross product with B, you get -E. Since E is in the +x-direction, the cross product v × B must be in the -x-direction. 

But which direction is v? Let me think. If E is in +x, then for the cross product v × B to be in -x, we can consider the right-hand rule. The cross product of v and B should point in the -x direction. 

Let me recall the right-hand rule. If I point my right thumb in the direction of velocity v and my index finger in the direction of B, the middle finger points in the direction of v × B. So if v × B is in -x, my middle finger needs to point in -x. That would happen if either:

1. v is in +y and B is in +z. Then v × B is in +x. But we need v × B in -x, so maybe v is in -y and B is in +z. Then v × B is (-y) × z = - (y × z) = - (-x) = +x? Wait, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, cross product of y and z is -x. So y × z = -x. Therefore, if v is in +y and B is in +z, then v × B is +y × +z = -x. Ah! So if v is in +y and B is in +z, then v × B is -x, which is what we need because E is in +x, so E + (v × B) = +x + (-x) = 0. So that would satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, if v is in -y and B is in -z, (-y) × (-z) = y × z = -x, so same result.

But the problem says the magnetic field is in +y-direction. Wait, no, the magnetic field is in +y-direction? Wait, no, the problem says the magnetic field is in the +y-direction. Wait, no, the problem says: uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction.

So E is +x, B is +y.

So the equation is E + v × B = 0.

So, E is +x, so v × B must be -x.

So, v × B = -x. Therefore, using the right-hand rule, v × B is -x. So, which combination of v and B would give that.

If B is in +y, then v must be in a direction such that when you cross it with +y, you get -x. So, let me think. Let's write the cross product: v × B = (v_x, v_y, v_z) × (0, B, 0) = (0, 0, B v_z - 0 v_z) wait, no.

Wait, cross product of two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is (b f - c e, c d - a f, a e - b d). So, since E is in +x, which is the electric field. But wait, the equation is E + v × B = 0, so E is in +x, so v × B must be in -x.

So B is in +y. So, let me consider B as (0, B, 0). Let me write v as (v_x, v_y, v_z). Then v × B is (v_y*0 - v_z*B, v_z*0 - v_x*0, v_x*B - v_y*0) = (-v_z B, 0, v_x B).

So v × B = (-v_z B, 0, v_x B).

We need this to be equal to -E. Since E is in +x, -E is (-E, 0, 0). So, set:

(-v_z B, 0, v_x B) = (-E, 0, 0)

Therefore, the components must be equal:

- v_z B = -E => v_z B = E

v_x B = 0 => v_x = 0

So, from this, v_x must be zero, and v_z must be E/B.

So, the velocity v has components (0, v_y, E/B). So, v is in the direction of +z. Wait, that's interesting. So the velocity is purely in the z-direction?

Wait, so if the proton is moving in the +z-direction before entering the E and B fields, and then in the region with E and B, its velocity is still in +z. But we also had the initial acceleration from rest through potential V, so it's moving in +z with some velocity.

But then, if in the E and B fields, the velocity is in +z, then the cross product v × B is in the direction of (-v_z B, 0, v_x B). Since v_x is zero, only the x-component is non-zero, which is -v_z B.

So, as previously, for the force to be zero, E must equal v_z B.

So, the proton's velocity is entirely in the z-direction, and the electric and magnetic fields are in x and y. So, in this case, the Lorentz force is all in the x-direction, but it's balanced by the electric field. So, effectively, the force from E and B cancels each other in the x-direction, resulting in zero net force.

So that's why the trajectory isn't affected.

Wait, so if I change the potential difference to 2V, the initial kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv² = 2qV, so v would be sqrt(2qV/m). So, the velocity in the z-direction would be higher. 

But then, when entering the E and B fields, the velocity is still in the +z direction. So, v is in +z. So, cross product v × B is in the direction of (-v_z B, 0, 0) because, as before, v_x = 0.

So, v × B is in the -x direction. So, E + v × B = E - (something in -x) = (E_x, 0, 0) + (-F_x, 0, 0) = (E_x - F_x, 0, 0). But in the original case, E_x = F_x, so they canceled. In the new case, E is doubled? Wait, no, the potential difference is doubled.

Wait, hold on. If the potential difference is doubled, the energy is double, so v would be higher, but the fields E and B are the same. So E is still in +x, B is still in +y.

So, in the first case, E was balancing v × B, which was in -x. So, E = v_z B.

In the second case, the velocity v_z is higher because the energy is double. So, v_z = sqrt(2qV/m) instead of sqrt(qV/m). So, v_z is sqrt(2) times bigger. So, E = v_z B, but in the second case, E is still the same? Or is E also doubled?

Wait, let me check. The potential difference is the acceleration voltage. The electric field in that region is due to the potential difference. Wait, no, the electric field in that region is uniform and given as E in +x. So, actually, E is a separate uniform electric field. So, E is fixed at some value, not depending on V.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me recap.

The proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, so it gains kinetic energy (1/2)mv² = eV (since q = e for a proton). So, v = sqrt(eV/m).

Then, this proton enters a region with E in +x and B in +y. The Lorentz force is balanced, so v × B = -E.

So, if E is in +x, then v × B is in -x. Since B is in +y, then v must be in +z. Because cross product of +z (v) and +y (B) is -x. So, v × B = -x, which cancels E.

In the new case, the potential difference is 2V, so the proton's kinetic energy is now (1/2)mv² = 2eV, so v = sqrt(2eV/m). So, velocity is higher, still in +z. So, the cross product v × B is still -x, so E + v × B = 0, as before. So, why would the trajectory be affected?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. If the initial velocity is higher, then the force on the proton is higher? But in the first case, the force was balanced, so net force was zero. In the second case, if the velocity is higher, but E is the same, then the force would be higher? Wait, no, because v × B is proportional to v, and E is fixed. So, if v increases, v × B increases, so the Lorentz force would be greater, but the electric field is fixed? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the actual forces. The proton experiences a force F = q(E + v × B). In the first case, since the trajectory isn't affected, F must be zero, so E = -v × B. In the second case, E is still +x, so if v has increased, v × B is now stronger, so E is not equal to -v × B, so the net force would be F = q(E + v × B) = q(E - |v × B|). So, if v has increased, |v × B| is larger, so F would be larger in the -x direction.

Wait, but E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, so E - |v × B| could be either positive or negative.

Wait, in the first case, v was such that E = |v × B|. So, F = 0.

In the second case, velocity is higher, so |v × B| is higher, but E is fixed. So, E = v_z B, with v_z being sqrt(2V/m) initially and sqrt(4V/m) now. So, v_z is sqrt(2) times higher.

But wait, in the second case, is E also doubled? Because E is the electric field from the potential difference? No, the problem says the electric field E is a uniform field in the +x direction, regardless of the potential difference. So E is the same.

Wait, no, the potential difference is used to accelerate the proton, but the E field is a separate field in the region the proton passes through. So E is a given value, not necessarily dependent on V.

Wait, perhaps that initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the region with E and B is created by some other means, not just the potential difference. So, E is fixed.

So, if the potential difference is 2V, the proton's initial velocity is higher, but E and B are the same. Therefore, when it enters the E and B region, the velocity is higher, so v × B is higher, which would cause a net force F = q(E + v × B). Since E = -v × B initially (from F = 0), but now v × B is higher, so E - (v × B) would be negative, meaning F = q(E + v × B) is in the direction opposite to E.

Wait, let me think again.

In the original case, the proton is moving in +z, so v is in +z. The electric field is in +x, the magnetic in +y. The force is F = q(E + v × B). Since v × B is -x, as before, E is +x, so E + (-x) = 0, so F = 0.

In the new case, the proton is moving with higher velocity in +z, so v × B is still -x, but let's compute its magnitude. If v was sqrt(eV/m), now it's sqrt(2eV/m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(eV/m). So, v × B is sqrt(2) times the original, but E is the same. So, E + (v × B) is sqrt(2) * (-x) + x = (1 - sqrt(2)) x, which is negative. So, the net force is in the -x direction.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says the proton's trajectory is not affected in the first case, implying F = 0. In the second case, since E and B are fixed, but the velocity is higher, so F ≠ 0, so the proton is deflected.

Therefore, the direction of the force is F = q(E + v × B). E is +x, v × B is -x, with magnitude sqrt(2) times. So, E + v × B is (1 - sqrt(2)) x. Since sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so 1 - sqrt(2) ≈ -0.414. So, the force is in the -x direction.

But wait, wait. If E is +x, and v × B is -x, but with larger magnitude, then the net force is F = q(-x), so it's deflected in the -x direction. However, the options given are:

A. deflected in the +x-direction

B. deflected in the -x-direction

C. deflected in the +y-direction

D. deflected in the -y-direction

So, the correct answer should be B, deflected in the -x-direction, but the problem states that the correct answer is A.

Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, perhaps my reasoning is flawed. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the original case, when the proton is accelerated through V, its velocity is v = sqrt(eV/m). Then, in the region with E and B, since F = q(E + v × B) = 0, we have E = -v × B. Since E is in +x, v × B is in -x.

So, let's compute v × B: if v is in +z, and B is in +y, then v × B is in -x, as we said.

In the second case, when the potential difference is 2V, the proton's velocity is higher, so v = sqrt(2eV/m). So, the magnitude of v × B is sqrt(2) times larger. However, E is fixed, so E = -v × B only if F = 0, but now, v × B is larger, so E ≠ -v × B, so F = q(E + v × B) ≠ 0.

So, the force is F = q(E + v × B). Since E is +x, and v × B is -x, the net force would be E - |v × B|. But since v × B is larger than E, F would be negative, so pointing in -x direction.

Wait, so that would mean deflection in -x. But the options have A as +x, B as -x.

But the correct answer is A, according to the problem. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction of the force wrong.

Wait, the force is F = q(E + v × B). If E is in +x, and v × B is in -x, but let's compute the vector sum.

So, E is (E, 0, 0), v × B is (-|v × B|, 0, 0). So, F = q(E - |v × B|, 0, 0). So, the direction is (E - |v × B|) x. So, if E was equal to |v × B|, F is zero. If E is now less than |v × B|, which they are in the second case, then F is in the direction of (E - |v × B|), which is negative. So, F is in the -x direction.

But the correct answer is supposedly A, deflected in +x.

Hmm, so why is that? Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the velocity is in +z is incorrect. Maybe the E and B fields are such that the proton's velocity is in another direction?

Wait, let me re-examine the initial conditions.

After being accelerated through V, the
