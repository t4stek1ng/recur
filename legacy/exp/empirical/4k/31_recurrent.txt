[recurrent thinking]
Okay, so I've got this question about 8-bit two's-complement numbers and overflow when adding two numbers. The question is asking which pair will result in an overflow when added together. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two 8-bit numbers. The answer is supposed to be B, but I want to understand why. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what two's-complement is. Two's-complement is a way to represent negative numbers in binary, right? So an 8-bit number can represent numbers from -128 to 127. Each bit is a power of 2, starting from 2^7 down to 2^0. The leftmost bit is the sign bit, which is 1 for negative numbers and 0 for positive. So, the first thing I should do is figure out whether each number in the pairs is positive or negative.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: 11111111, 00000001
Option B: 00000001, 10000000
Option C: 11111111, 10000001
Option D: 10000001, 10101010

Starting with Option A: The first number is 11111111. Since the first bit is 1, that's negative. Let me calculate its decimal value. The two's-complement of 11111111 is -128 because it's the minimum value for an 8-bit number. The second number is 00000001, which is 1 in decimal. So adding -128 and 1 should give -127. But wait, in 8-bit two's-complement, does that cause an overflow?

Hmm, adding -128 and 1 is -127, which is within the representable range of -128 to 127, so no overflow occurs. So Option A doesn't cause an overflow. Got it.

Option B: 00000001, 10000000. Let's convert these to decimal. 00000001 is 1, and 10000000 is 128 in decimal, but in two's-complement, since the first bit is 1, it's -128. So we have 1 and -128. Adding these together gives 1 + (-128) = -127. Again, that's within the range, so does that cause overflow?

Wait, no, because the result is still within -128 to 127. So why is Option B the correct answer? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe the question is about when adding the two numbers together causes the sum to exceed the 8-bit two's-complement range. So, if their sum is outside of -128 to 127, that's when there's an overflow. But 1 + (-128) is -127, which is within the range. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe it's not the sum but something else. Maybe the question is about the addition causing both numbers to be outside the 8-bit two's-complement range? That doesn't make much sense because each number is already an 8-bit number, so adding them would still be within 16 bits, but when converted back to 8 bits, it might overflow.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the addition in 8-bit two's-complement arithmetic. So, when adding two numbers, if the result would require more than 8 bits, it overflows. So, let's see.

So, adding two 8-bit numbers: each addition is done in 8 bits, and if the sum exceeds 8 bits, it causes an overflow. Let me compute the sum in 8 bits for each option.

Option A: 11111111 + 00000001. Let's add them. 11111111 is -128, and 00000001 is 1. Adding them gives -127. In 8-bit two's-complement, is -127 represented as 10000001? Wait, no. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 127 is 01111111, so -127 is 10000001. So yes, adding -128 and 1 gives -127, which is 10000001. But wait, when we add 11111111 (which is -128) and 00000001 (which is 1), the sum is 10000001, which is still 8 bits. So no overflow occurs because it's still within the 8-bit two's-complement range.

Wait, but maybe when adding the two positive numbers? No, in this case, one is negative.

Wait, maybe I need to represent the addition using two's-complement addition, so adding the two numbers and see if the sum exceeds 8 bits. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should actually perform the addition step by step, adding each bit with the carry-over.

So, let me try that for Option B.

Option B: 00000001 and 10000000.

First, let's note that 00000001 is 1 and 10000000 is -128.

But when adding in two's-complement, let's think in terms of binary addition.

Adding 00000001 and 10000000:

Starting from the right:
Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1, no carry.
Bit 1: 0 + 0 = 0, no carry.
...
Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1, but wait, since it's two's-complement, perhaps we need to consider the sign. Hmm, no, actually, when adding two numbers, the addition is done as binary addition regardless of the sign. The sign is just determined by the result.

Wait, but in two's-complement addition, the carry-out from the 7th bit is a sign bit. Hmm, but in this case, let's just do the addition.

So, 00000001
+10000000
= ?

Let me add them:

Starting from the right:
Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1
Bit 1: 0 + 0 = 0
...
Bit 6: 0 + 0 = 0
Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1

But that would give 00000001 + 10000000 = 10000001, which is -127. So, still within 8 bits.

Wait, but 00000001 is 1, 10000000 is -128, so 1 + (-128) is -127, which is still within the 8-bit range, so no overflow.

But the answer is supposed to be B. So why is that?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when adding two numbers, if the sum exceeds 8 bits, or if one of the numbers is beyond the 8-bit two's-complement range, but in this case, both are 8-bit numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers themselves, when added, exceed the 8-bit capacity when considering their sum as a signed number.

Wait, 00000001 is 1, and 10000000 is -128. So, the sum is -127, which is within -128 to 127. So, no overflow.

Hmm, this is confusing. So, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pair causing an overflow when each is added to another number, not the sum of the two numbers. Or maybe the question is about the two's-complement addition process, where if the carry-out is generated beyond the 8th bit, that's an overflow.

Wait, let me try adding 00000001 and 10000000 in two's-complement addition.

Starting from the right:

Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1, no carry.

Bit 1: 0 + 0 = 0, no carry.

...

Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1, but since it's the 8th bit, if there's a carry, it would overflow.

But is there a carry? Wait, in the addition, each bit is added along with any carry from the previous bit.

Wait, but in this case, each bit is either 0 or 1, so when adding 00000001 and 10000000:

Let me write this out:

  00000001
+10000000
=?

Starting from the right:
Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1, carry 0.
Bit 1: 0 + 0 = 0, carry 0.
Bit 2: 0 + 0 = 0, carry 0.
...
Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1, carry 0.

So, the sum is 10000001, which is 8 bits. So, no overflow.

Wait, so that doesn't cause overflow. Then why is option B the correct answer?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "which of the following pairs of 8-bit, two's-complement numbers will result in overflow when the members of the pairs are added."

So, each pair is two numbers. When they are added together, does the sum cause an overflow?

Wait, so adding two numbers, each 8-bit, could result in a sum that is 16 bits, but when converting back to 8-bit two's-complement, does it overflow?

Wait, but in two's-complement arithmetic, when adding two numbers, the sum is stored in 8 bits. So, if the sum is outside the 8-bit two's-complement range, it overflows.

But let's think about each option.

Option A: 11111111 (-128) + 00000001 (1) = -127, which is 10000001, 8 bits. So, no overflow.

Option B: 00000001 (1) + 10000000 (-128) = -127, same as above, 8 bits. No overflow.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the other options.

Option C: 11111111 (-128) + 10000001.

What's 10000001 in decimal? Let me convert. The first bit is 1, so it's negative. So, 10000001 in two's-complement is -129. So, adding -128 and -129: -128 + (-129) = -257. But wait, in 8-bit two's-complement, the minimum is -128. So, -257 cannot be represented in 8 bits; it would overflow.

But let me do the addition properly.

Adding 11111111 and 10000001 in two's-complement:

  11111111
+10000001
= ?

Adding each bit:

Bit 0: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 1: 1 + 0 + carry 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 2: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 3: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 4: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 5: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 6: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 7: 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carry 1.

Wait, so we have a carry-out from the 7th bit, which would overflow. So, this addition would cause an overflow because the carry propagates all the way and can't be accommodated in 8 bits.

Therefore, Option C results in overflow.

Option D: 10000001 (-129) + 10101010.

First, let's convert 10101010 to decimal. The first bit is 1, so it's negative. Let's calculate:

From right: bits are 10101010.

So, bits set are positions 7, 5, 3, and 1.

So, the value is:

128 - 64 + (-32) + (-16) + 8 - ... Wait, no, actually, two's-complement is calculated as:

Decimal = (-2^7) * bit7 + (-2^6)*bit6 + ... + (-2^0)*bit0.

So, for 10101010:

Decimal = (-128) + (-64)*0 + (-32)*1 + (-16)*0 + (-8)*1 + (-4)*0 + (-2)*1 + 0*1.

Wait, no, actually, each bit position corresponds to its own value.

Wait, 10101010:

Bit 7: 1 => -128

Bit 6: 0 => 0

Bit 5: 1 => -32

Bit 4: 0 => 0

Bit 3: 1 => -16

Bit 2: 0 => 0

Bit 1: 1 => -2

Bit 0: 0 => 0

So, adding those up: -128 -32 -16 -2 = -178.

So, 10101010 is -178 in decimal.

Adding to 10000001 which is -129:

-129 + (-178) = -307.

But in 8-bit two's-complement, the minimum is -128, so adding these two numbers would result in a sum that can't be represented in 8 bits, hence an overflow occurs.

But wait, let's see if the addition itself overflows during the addition process.

Adding 10000001 (-129) and 10101010 (-178):

Let me write it down.

  10000001
+10101010
= ?

Starting from the right:

Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1, no carry.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 = 1, no carry.

Bit 2: 0 + 0 = 0, no carry.

Bit 3: 0 + 1 = 1, no carry.

Bit 4: 0 + 0 = 0, no carry.

Bit 5: 0 + 1 = 1, no carry.

Bit 6: 0 + 0 = 0, no carry.

Bit 7: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

But wait, that's the 8th bit, which would cause an overflow. So, we have a carry-out, which can't be stored in 8 bits. Therefore, this addition causes an overflow.

Wait, but both Option C and D seem to cause an overflow. But in the question, only one answer is correct, which is B. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, let me re-examine Option B.

Option B: 00000001 and 10000000.

As we saw, adding 1 and -128 gives -127, which is 10000001, which is 8 bits. So, no overflow.

Wait, unless I'm making a mistake in interpreting the two's-complement addition. Let me try adding 00000001 and 10000000 in two's-complement.

But 00000001 is 1 and 10000000 is -128.

So, in two's-complement, the addition is:

1 in binary is 00000001.

-128 is 11111111.

Adding them:

00000001
+11111111
= ?

Let's do this in two's-complement:

Start from the right:

Bit 0: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0, carry 1.

Bit 2: 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

...

Bit 7: 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

But now, we have a carry beyond the 7th bit, which is the sign bit, so that causes an overflow.

Wait, so when you add 1 and -128 in two's-complement, you get -127, which is 10000001 in 8 bits. But in reality, the addition process with carries does result in a carry beyond the 8th bit, which is the overflow.

So, perhaps that is the reason why Option B causes an overflow.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Because when I converted the numbers to decimal, their sum was -127, which is within the 8-bit range. But when adding in two's-complement, we might have an overflow because of the carry beyond the 8th bit.

Hmm, I need to clarify this.

In two's-complement addition, if adding two numbers causes the carry to go beyond the 8th bit, that's an overflow. So, adding 1 (00000001) and -128 (11111111):

Start adding:

Bit 0: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 2: 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

...

Bit 7: 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

After Bit 7, we have a carry, so that's an overflow.

But the result is 10000001, which is -127, but the addition process itself causes an overflow because the carry doesn't fit into 8 bits.

So, in that case, adding 1 and -128 in two's-complement causes an overflow because the addition requires a carry beyond the 8th bit.

But in that case, Option B also causes an overflow. But then why is Option C also causing an overflow?

Wait, in Option C: 11111111 (-128) + 10000001 (-129). Adding these two in two's-complement.

Let me try adding them:

11111111 + 10000001.

Which is -128 + (-129) = -257.

But in 8 bits, can we represent -257? No, because the minimum is -128. So, it's an overflow.

But when adding:

11111111
+10000001
= ?

Starting from right:

Bit 0: 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 1: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 2: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

...

Bit 6: 1 + 0 + 1 = 0, carry 1.

Bit 7: 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carry 1.

Again, we have a carry beyond the 8th
