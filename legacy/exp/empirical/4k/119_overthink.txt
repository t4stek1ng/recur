[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate for the given questions about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions tautomerism. Tautomerism occurs when a molecule can shift between different structural forms that are chemically equivalent. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Starting with benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. I remember that benzoquinone can exist in different forms, like para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone. Wait, but I also recall that benzoquinone can tautomerize. Since it's a diketone, the two carbonyl groups can switch places through keto-enol tautomerism. So, benzoquinone can actually tautomerize into another structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does show tautomerism.

Now, looking at cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. Since all the carbonyl groups are in conjugated positions, I wonder if tautomerism is possible here. In tautomerism, typically you need a hydrogen that can shift to form a different structure. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl group is adjacent to two other carbonyls. Since all the carbonyls are already at positions 1, 3, and 5, I don't see an obvious place for a hydrogen to shift to form another tautomer. Each carbon with a carbonyl is already part of the ring, and moving a hydrogen from one carbonyl to another might not lead to a different structure because all positions are symmetric. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have the same kind of tautomerism that benzoquinone does because there's no possibility for a keto-enol type shift here. Therefore, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione because it doesn't show tautomerism.

Moving on to question B: identifying which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Starting with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure has a central carbon (the second carbon) attached to a hydroxyl group, a methyl ester group, and two other groups. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Hmm, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. But wait, that doesn't have a chiral center. Let me check the molecule again.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula would be CH3COOCH2CH2OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let's think: the acid is propanoic acid, so it's CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH on the second carbon becomes OMe. Wait, no. Esterification replaces the -OH of the acid with an OMe group. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH, so esterification would give CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3

But looking at the central carbon (the second carbon), it's attached to:

- CH2(OH) group

- CH2COOCH3 group

- Two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me clarify the structure. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate backbone is three carbons: the first carbon is the COOCH3, the second is the hydroxyl, and the third is a CH2. So the structure is: 

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH2-

Is that right? So the second carbon has a hydroxyl group, attached to two CH2 groups and the carboxylate ester group. So the second carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3

- OH

- CH2-

- Another CH2?

Wait, no. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

HOCH2-C(COOCH3)-H

Wait, that's more accurate. So the central carbon (second position) has:

- Hydroxyl group

- Carboxylate ester (OCOCH3)

- Two H atoms.

Oh, wait! So the second carbon is attached to:

- OH, OCOCH3, and two H's.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH(COOCH3)2?

No, wait, no. Because it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the chain is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- Two CH2 groups (one to the left, one to the right)

- One hydroxyl group

- One carboxylate ester group

So the second carbon is CH2(OH) attached to another CH2 on one side and to COOCH3 on the other. Therefore, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH2(OH)

- CH2-

- COOCH3

- And another carbon on the right side.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me draw it step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon: HOCH2CH2COOH.

When esterified with methanol, the -OH on the middle carbon becomes -OCH3, so the ester becomes:

CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, in esterification, the acid's -OH reacts with an alcohol to form an ester. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. When you esterify it with methanol, the -OH on the second carbon becomes -OCH3, so the structure becomes:

CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, is the second carbon now a chiral center? Let me see: The second carbon is attached to:

- OCH3

- CH2COOCH3

- Two CH2 groups?

No, actually, the structure is:

The first carbon: COOCH3

Second carbon: attached to -OCH3, -CH2-, and two more groups.

Wait, maybe I should label the carbons:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: attached to Carbon 1, Hydroxyl (which becomes OCH3), and two CH2 groups?

No, wait. Let me think again. The acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. So when we esterify it, the ester group replaces the -OH. So the ester becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

But wait, that would mean the second carbon is CH2(OCH3), connected to the first carbon (COOCH3) and the third carbon (CH2-). So the second carbon is attached to:

- OCH3

- COOCH3

- CH2-

- CH3?

Wait, no. Because if it's methyl ester, the COOCH3 is attached to the first carbon. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH2(OCH3)

Carbon 3: CH2-

Wait, so Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), but that can't have four bonds. Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The 2-hydroxypropanoate ester is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But when you esterify, you replace the -OH on C2 with OCH3. So it becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is now connected to OCH3, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group. So four groups: OCH3, CH2, CH2, and COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2(OCH3)-CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH2(OCH3)

Carbon 3: CH2-

But Carbon 2 is attached to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3)

- OCH3

- Two CH2 groups: which would be Carbon 2 to Carbon 3 and Carbon 2 to... wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), so it's connected to:

- COOCH3 (Carbon 1)

- OCH3

- Two CH2 groups: one leading to Carbon 3, and the other leading where? Since it's a straight chain, Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3. So Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), with two CH2 groups? No, wait. It's actually:

The molecule is: CH3COOCH2CH2(OCH3)

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3 when esterified.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

2-Hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When methyl esterified, the -OH on the second carbon becomes -OCH3. So the structure becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is attached to:

- OCH3

- CH2COOCH3

- Two CH2 groups, one to Carbon 1 and one to Carbon 3.

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is in the middle. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OCH3)CH2-

Wait, no. It's CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3? That can't be right because that would lead to a four-bonded carbon.

Wait, maybe I should write the structure as:

O
|| 
O C - C - C
         |
         OCH3
      /     \
   H       H

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the molecule as:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Esterification would replace the -OH on the second carbon with OCH3, so:

CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the one attached to OCH3 and COOCH3), is it a chiral center?

A chiral center requires four different groups attached. Let's see:

Carbon 2 is attached to:

- OCH3

- CH2COOCH3

- Two CH2 groups? Wait, no. If the structure is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3, then Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3) connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

So, Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), with two H's attached. Wait, then Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3. No, that would mean Carbon 2 is attached to three CH2 groups and an OCH3. That can't be right because that would require four bonds.

Wait, I think I messed up the structure.

Let me try again. 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified, each -OH is replaced with OCH3. So for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, only the second -OH is replaced, so it becomes CH2(OCH3)CH2COOH. Wait, that can't be, because esterification would involve the -OH of the acid. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid has two -OH groups? No, wait, it's a diol? No, no. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxy, that's HOCH2CH2COOH. So only one -OH group on the second carbon. Then, esterification would replace that -OH with OCH3. So the ester would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

But that would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCH3

Wait, that can't be because the chain would have to be COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that would mean the chain is broken.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let's clarify:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, meaning CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2-hydroxy, the -OH is on the second carbon: HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Esterification would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So it becomes HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that's still an acid. To make it an ester, you have to replace both -OH groups with OMe? Wait, no. Wait, the esterification of a hydroxy acid is different. I might need to look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to reason.

In esterification, the -OH of the acid reacts with the alcohol to form an ester. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid has two -OH groups? No, just one on the second carbon. So when esterified, the -OH on the second carbon would become OMe, and the carboxylic acid becomes a carboxylate ester.

Wait, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified, the -OH on the second carbon becomes OMe, and the -COOH becomes COOCH3. So the ester would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make it CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3, right? So the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 ?

No, that's not correct. Let me write it properly.

Actually, the structure should be:

The carboxylic acid group (COOH) becomes a carboxylate ester (COOCH3). The hydroxyl group on C2 becomes OCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3.

So, Carbon 2 is attached to:

- OCH3

- CH2COOCH3

- Two CH2 groups: one to Carbon 1 and one to Carbon 3.

Wait, Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3). If the molecule is CH2(OCH3)CH2COOCH3, then Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), connected to Carbon 1 (COOCH3) and Carbon 3 (CH2-). So Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), which is attached to two CH2 groups, OCH3, and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, so the four groups on Carbon 2 are:

1. OCH3

2. COOCH3

3. CH2-

4. CH2-

But wait, two CH2 groups? No, that can't be because that would require two bonds. Actually, Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3, each of which is a CH2 group.

So Carbon 2 is CH2(OCH3), connected to Carbon 1 (COOCH3) and Carbon 3 (CH2-CH2-?).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to represent it as:

The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

No, that doesn't make sense because it would have two ester groups.

Wait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the acid, which is the middle carbon.

So the acid is HO-CH2-CH2-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH on the second carbon becomes -OCH3, and the -COOH becomes -COOCH3.

So the ester is CH2(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

But that would mean the molecule is COOCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-OCH3. So the chain is broken between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. It should be a continuous chain. So the correct structure
[overthinking]
Alright, let me try to figure out this question. So, the first part is about tautomerism, and the second part is about optical isomerism. I need to determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism and which one shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Starting with part A: tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen and rearrangement of double bonds, leading to different structures that are chemically equivalent. So, which compound is less likely to show tautomerism?

The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as ketones, so it's C6H4O2. Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, right? So, it's C6H8O3. 

Hmm, tautomerism is more common in compounds with conjugated double bonds or lone pairs that can shift. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, which are already conjugated, but does that allow for tautomerism? I remember that quinones can sometimes undergo tautomerism to form enol forms, but benzoquinone is more stable because of the aromatic ring. So, maybe it doesn't show tautomerism as readily.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. That's more than benzoquinone. I think tricyclic ketones might have more opportunities for tautomerism because there are more sites where a hydrogen could shift. So, maybe benzoquinone (A) is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. But wait, I'm a bit confused because quinones are known for their stability. Maybe benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't tautomerize, while the tricyclic one is less stable and can tautomerize. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, I should think about enol forms. The enol form requires the presence of alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone has alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the ketones), but since it's a benzene ring, those are all substituted with carbonyl groups, so maybe the alpha hydrogens are not present. No, wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, so maybe it's fully conjugated and doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me check: the structure of benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (1,4 positions). So, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are part of the benzene ring, which is fully conjugated, so there are no alpha hydrogens because those carbons are bonded to oxygen or other carbons. Therefore, benzoquinone can't have tautomerism because it lacks alpha hydrogens.

But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. That would mean there are multiple alpha carbons, each with hydrogens. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione should have the possibility of tautomerism. Therefore, A is benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism because no alpha hydrogens, and the other one does.

Moving on to part B: optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center and an asymmetric carbon that can be mirrored, leading to left and right-handed forms.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is: the central carbon (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) is connected to a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group (from the ester), and another group. Wait, what's its structure exactly? Propanoate means a three-carbon chain. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the formula is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, methyl ester. So, it's CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, let me think.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon of propanoic acid. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, so it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But as an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, is this structure chiral?

Looking at the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group), let's see: attached to it are a hydroxyl group, a CH2COOCH3 group, another CH2 group, and another CH3 group. Wait, is that correct? Let me draw it:

The molecule would be: O
              |
CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH2CH3? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH2 next to the hydroxyl. Wait, no, the hydroxyl is on the first carbon? Or the middle?

Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, then 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)CH2OH? No, wait, that can't be because that would make it a diol. Wait, no. Let's see, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the hydroxyl is on the first carbon of the three-carbon chain, but that's actually 2-hydroxy, but numbering starts from the carboxylic acid end. So, the carboxylic acid is carbon 1, the middle is carbon 2, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(COOH)CH(OH)2? No, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)COOH. So, in the ester form, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the middle carbon has a hydroxyl group, a methyl ester, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that would be four carbons. Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me recall the structure properly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, as an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule has a hydroxyl group on the first carbon, then a CH2, then a COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second carbon, which has two CH2 groups attached: one from carbon 1 (with hydroxyl) and one to carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3). Wait, no, actually, the structure is:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 2: CH2
- Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, so the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to two CH2 groups, but also to the COOCH3 group. So, what's attached to carbon 2? It's connected to a CH2OH group, a CH2 group (which connects to COOCH3), and two other groups, but wait, carbon 2 is CH2, so it's only connected to carbon 1 and 3, right? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH2CH3. No, that's four carbons. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the ester group. The ester is OOC-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, that would have a chiral center. Let me think: if the structure is CH3CH(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH group,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? Wait, that would make four groups, so it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the middle carbon (from the ester side) is connected to:

- OOCCH3,
- CH(OH),
- and two CH3 groups? No, that would make it:

(CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, but that would require a double bond maybe. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

CH3CH(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the OH is on the second carbon, which has:

- CH3, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

But in this structure, the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) is the first carbon, which is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, that carbon is only connected to three groups, because it's a propane chain. So, HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3: the first carbon is HO-CH2-, the second carbon is CH2-, connected to COOCH3.

So, in this case, the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- HOCH2-,
- COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, because it's CH2 in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Therefore, the second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HOCH2,
- COOCH3,
- and two CH2 groups? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the second carbon is connected to the first carbon (HOCH2-) and the third carbon (COOCH3). Since it's a CH2 group, it must have four bonds. So, the second carbon is bonded to:

- HOCH2-,
- COOCH3,
- and two more groups? Wait, no. Carbons have four bonds. So, HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3: the second CH2 is bonded to HOCH2, COOCH3, and two H's. So, it's not a chiral center because it's symmetric.

Wait, so maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm, but that contradicts what the question says because it's asking which one shows optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Maybe it's CH3C(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, that would be a four-carbon chain again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the possible presence of a chiral center. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center, which requires four different substituents on a carbon.

So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, that would make it four substituents. Wait, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon is the one attached to OH, with substituents:

- CH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2? Or maybe another group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the actual structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have OH on the second carbon, so it's HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, numbering from the COOCH3 end, the first carbon is COOCH3, the second is CH2, the third is CH2OH. So, 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon, which is CH2, connected to COOCH3 and CH2OH. So, the middle carbon is CH2, attached to COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. So, that carbon isn't chiral because it's symmetric.

Wait, now I'm really confused. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so it wouldn't show optical isomerism. Then, what about dimethyl fumarate? Dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is an alkene with two carboxylic acid groups. The structure is CH2=CH-COOCH3 on both sides. So, the central double bond is between the two carbonyl groups.

Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is the diester, so it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the diester would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(CH3OOC). So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So, the central double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

In this structure, the double bond is not between two CH2 groups but between two CH groups. So, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, the central carbons each have two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and the double bond between them. So, that's a trans double bond. But does this create a possibility for geometric isomerism? Yes, fumarate is the trans isomer, and if it were cis, it would be another isomer, but here it's already trans.

But wait, optical isomerism requires a chiral center, not geometric isomerism. So, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? The carbons in the double bond have two substituents each: one COOCH3 and one H. But since they are double-bonded, they can't have four substituents. So, the double bond carbons are each bonded to two substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, unless there's another part of the molecule with a chiral center. But in fumarate, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3. So, the structure is symmetric around the double bond. Therefore, both sides are the same, so the molecule is meso, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry, so it can't have optical isomers because the mirror image is the same as the original.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. For dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric. Each CH group in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a H. So, if you look at the entire molecule, it's symmetric across the double bond, meaning it's a meso compound. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism because it's achiral despite having a chiral center? Wait, no, there's no chiral center here because the double bond doesn't allow for a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Let me recap.

Part A: Benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because it's fully conjugated as a benzene ring with two ketone groups, so no tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, which provides multiple alpha carbons with hydrogens, allowing for tautomerism. So, A is benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Part B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If its structure has a chiral center, it would show optical isomerism. If not, then dimethyl fumarate might not either.

Wait, let
[overthinking]
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying which compound doesn't show tautomerism and which one shows optical isomerism among the given options. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen and electrons between atoms, leading to different structural forms that are similar. Optical isomerism, on the other hand, has to do with the spatial arrangement of atoms, making the compound chiral, meaning it has no plane of symmetry.

First, let's look at compound A. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which one doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. It has a structure with alternating double bonds, right? I think benzoquinone can exist in different tautomeric forms because of the presence of the ketone groups. Wait, but actually, benzoquinone is usually in the enol form or the keto form? No, wait, benzoquinone is more like a diene with two ketones. Maybe it can't undergo tautomerism because shifting a hydrogen might not lead to a different structure due to the aromatic ring. Hmm, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at the 1,3, and 5 positions. Since it's fully conjugated with three carbonyl groups, I don't think there's a possibility for tautomerism here because there's no available hydrogen to shift; all the alpha positions are already occupied by carbonyl groups. So, A must be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione because it doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, for part B, we have methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. The question is which one shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a single carbon atom.

Starting with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let's look at the hydroxyl group on the central carbon. The central carbon is connected to a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, a carboxylate group, and another carboxylate group. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me draw it out.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The propanoate is CH2(COOCH3)-CHOH-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

1. A methyl group (CH3)
2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)
3. A carboxylate group (COOCH3)
4. Another carbon (but wait, in this structure, the central carbon is connected to three carbons? No, actually, in propanoate, there are three carbons. So, it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second one, connected to:

- One methyl (CH3)
- One hydroxyl (-OH)
- One carboxylate group (COOCH3)
- And another carbon (from the propanoate chain). Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 or something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- One methyl (CH3)
- One hydroxyl (-OH)
- One carboxylate group (-COOCH3)
- And another carbon (CH2- from the first part). Wait, does that make four different groups? So, CH3, -OH, -COOCH3, and the rest is a CH2 group? No, actually, the central carbon is connected to four different groups: methyl, hydroxyl, carboxylate, and the adjacent carbon. So, the adjacent carbon is a CH2, but wait, if the central carbon is the second carbon, then it's connected to:

- First carbon: CH3
- Second carbon: connected to hydroxyl, carboxylate, and two other CH2 groups?

Wait, maybe I should write the structure. The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has:

- One methyl (CH3-) attached
- One hydroxyl (-OH)
- One carboxylate (-COOCH3)
- And the fourth group is a CH2 group connected to the first and third carbons.

Wait, so the central carbon is attached to:

1. Methyl (CH3)
2. Hydroxyl (-OH)
3. Carboxylate (-COOCH3)
4. A CH2 group which is connected to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, in reality, the central carbon is attached to:

- One methyl (CH3)
- One hydroxyl (-OH)
- One carboxylate (-COOCH3)
- And another single bond to a carbon, which is part of the rest of the chain.

Wait, but in this case, the central carbon is the second carbon of propanoate, so it's attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH3
- Carbon 2: (central) with hydroxyl and carboxylate
- Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the substituents on the central carbon. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the second one) is attached to:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- A carboxylate group (-COOCH3)
- And a hydrogen atom? No, wait, that can't be. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has three substituents: methyl, hydroxyl, and carboxylate, but a carbon can't have three substituents without a fourth. Wait, no, in this case, the central carbon is connected to:

- The first carbon: CH3-
- The third carbon: COOCH3-
- And the hydroxyl group.

But actually, each carbon in a chain is connected to two other carbons (except the ends). So, the central carbon is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3-
- Carbon 2: (central)
- Carbon 3: COOCH3-

So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- C1: CH2-
- C3: COOCH3-
- And has a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the structure is actually (CH2)2 with substituents.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (carboxylate)
- And another carbon (the adjacent one, which is C1 or C3). If it's C2, then it's connected to C1 and C3, but as a central carbon, it should have four substituents.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to count the substituents. Let me look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate to clarify.

Wait, no, I can't actually look it up, but from what I recall, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate, so the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. But when it's methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be butanoate.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the central carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's four carbons. So, if it's propanoate, it should be three carbons. So, maybe the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, in this case, the central carbon (the second one) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (carboxylate)
- And another CH2 group?

Wait, no, each carbon in a chain is connected to two other carbons. So, the second carbon is connected to the first carbon (CH3) and the third carbon (COOCH3). So, in addition to those, it has a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- C1: CH3-
- C3: COOCH3-
- And has an -OH group and a -CH2- group? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, in this structure, the central carbon is the one with the hydroxyl, so it must have four substituents. So, C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3-
- C3: COOCH3-
- OH group
- And another CH2 group? Or maybe another CH3?

Wait, no, maybe the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, so C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C3)
- And a single bond to another carbon (C2 is connected to C1 and C3, but where's the fourth substituent? Oh, wait, each carbon only connects to two others in a chain, so the central carbon (C2) has two substituents from the chain, the OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, that can't be four substituents.

I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's think about the number of substituents. The central carbon (C2) in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 is connected to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- And what's the fourth? It must be a hydrogen because in a chain, the central carbon is connected to two other carbons and has two hydrogens. So, in this case, the central carbon has:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- H

So, that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. But H is a special case. Wait, no, the substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2? No, wait, the carbon can't have more than four bonds.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the central carbon has four different substituents. If the central carbon has:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- And another CH2, but that would still be four different groups? Wait, no, because if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- And two CH2 groups? No, each carbon in a chain is connected to two others.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the central carbon has three substituents besides the chain. So, in this case, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- And perhaps a hydrogen, but that wouldn't make it chiral because a hydrogen isn't a different substituent.

Wait, no, in order for a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. So, if the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H, that's four substituents, but H is the same as another H. No, wait, each H is indistinct. So, does that make it chiral?

Wait, no, because in that case, the central carbon would have three different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. But since H is just a single substituent, it doesn't count as different. So, the central carbon would have three different substituents plus a hydrogen, but that's still not four different groups. So, maybe it's not chiral.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. So, if the central carbon has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H, that's only three different substituents because H is just H. So, it doesn't have four, hence it's not chiral. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate wouldn't have optical isomerism because the central carbon isn't a chiral center.

But wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the central carbon is connected to four different groups. Let me think about the structure again. Maybe it's:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (C3)
- And another CH2 group? Wait, but that would be a fourth substituent. No, in reality, C2 is connected to C1 and C3, so it can only have two substituents from the chain. So, it must have two substituents from the chain, the OH, and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's:

CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a cyclic ester or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's think about dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, fumarate is the conjugate base, so dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not fumarate. Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so dimethyl fumarate would be (CH2=CH) with two COOCH3 groups. So, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not possible. Fumarate is the diester, so it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is CH2=CH with two carboxylate groups on either side of the double bond.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-C=C-O(CO2CH3)

Wait, no, it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, so the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two carboxylate groups? No, that can't be. Wait, actually, fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to two carboxylate groups. Wait, but that would make it a symmetrical structure.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon in the double bond can only have two substituents. So, in fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to a carboxylate group. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3

But in this case, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to a carboxylate group. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3

Which is symmetric, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about which one shows optical isomerism. So, if dimethyl fumarate is symmetric, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. Then, maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism.

Wait, going back to methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the central carbon has four different substituents, then it's chiral. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is connected to:

1. CH3 (from C1)

[overthinking]
Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. There are two parts here: part A is about tautomerism, and part B is about optical isomerism. Hmm, okay, I need to determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism and which will show optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Starting with part A: compounds that do not show tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and a pi bond, leading to different structures with the same molecular formula. I remember that compounds with keto-enol tautomerism usually show this. So, which of the two given compounds might not do that?

The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me see... Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, if it has two ketone groups, can it undergo enol tautomerism? In enol tautomerism, a hydrogen moves from an oxygen to a carbon, and a double bond forms. But wait, in benzoquinone, the rings are aromatic, and the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the ring. I don't think the carbonyl can undergo enol tautomerism because that would disrupt the aromaticity. So, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring. Each ketone could potentially tautomerize. But I think in a cyclic system like this, each carbonyl group is a part of a conjugated system, so tautomerism might not be possible because moving a hydrogen would require breaking conjugation or disrupting the ring structure. Wait, but in some cases, cyclic ketones can undergo enolization. For example, cyclohexanone can tautomerize to an enol form. So, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can also tautomerize. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, but in a cyclic system with multiple carbonyl groups, is tautomerism possible? For example, in 1,3,5-tricyclohexanone, each carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, so does that prevent tautomerism? Or does it still allow for some enolization?

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more rigid and doesn't allow tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might still have some. But I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each compound. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. In benzoquinone, each ketone is conjugated into the ring. If a tautomerism occurs, like an enol form, that would mean a hydrogen moving from an oxygen to an adjacent carbon, creating a double bond. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are already part of the aromatic ring's conjugation, so I don't think there's a possibility of the oxygen having a hydrogen to move. Wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone groups, so each oxygen has a double bond to a carbon, so they don't have hydrogens attached. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo enol tautomerism because the oxygens don't have hydrogens to move.

But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each with oxygen double-bonded to a carbon, so each oxygen also doesn't have a hydrogen. Therefore, neither of these can undergo tautomerism, right? Because tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen on the oxygen or another position to shift. If the oxygen doesn't have a hydrogen, then tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait a minute, the question is about which compound does not show tautomerism. So, maybe both of them don't show tautomerism? But the answer is one of them. Maybe the question is referring to possibility of keto-enol tautomerism, but in both cases, the carbonyls are in positions where they can't tautomerize because of the ring structures.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Benzoquinone: two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, in benzoquinone, each ketone is part of the aromatic ring. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen on the oxygen. If the oxygen doesn't have a hydrogen, you can't have a tautomer. Both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have oxygen atoms double-bonded, so they don't have hydrogens. So neither can tautomerize. So, both A and B would have no tautomerism.

But the answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Maybe because in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, you can have enol forms where the carbonyl oxygen can get a hydrogen from somewhere, but in benzoquinone, you can't.

Wait, but in a cyclic ketone, you can have enolization, but only if the carbonyl has adjacent hydrogens. Hmm, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl has adjacent carbons with hydrogens? Or does the ring structure prevent that?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each of these carbonyls is between two methyl groups or something.

Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups every other carbon. So, the structure is like O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C=O? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, so each carbonyl is on one carbon, and the adjacent carbons are connected in a ring. So, maybe each carbonyl is on a carbon connected to two other carbons, which may or may not have hydrogens.

Wait, if it's 1,3,5-trione, then every other carbon is a carbonyl. So, the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in a ring. So, in that case, the carbonyls are alternated with CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon adjacent to two CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 units. So, the oxygen of the carbonyl is double-bonded to a carbon, so no hydrogen on the oxygen. But the carbons next to the carbonyl have hydrogens.

Wait, but for enol tautomerism, do we need a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon? Hmm, no, enol tautomerism is when a hydrogen moves from the oxygen to the adjacent carbon, creating a double bond. Wait, no, actually, in keto-enol tautomerism, an enol form has a hydroxyl group on a carbon adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps in the case of multiple carbonyls, the hydrogens on the adjacent carbons can shift. So, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the oxygen can take a hydrogen from one of the adjacent CH2 groups, forming an enol. So, can that happen?

If that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo enol tautomerism, making it a tautomer. But wait, since it's a cyclic system, would that affect the possibility? Or maybe it's more rigid.

Hmm, now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of specific examples. For instance, cyclohexanone is a single ketone, and it can undergo enol tautomerism. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3-dione (with two ketones) can also tautomerize by forming an enol form between the two carbonyls. So, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can also do that. So, does that mean that both cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and benzoquinone can tautomerize?

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are conjugated into the aromatic ring. So, if an enol form is formed, would that disrupt the aromaticity? Since benzene rings are stable due to conjugation, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because it would break the conjugation and create a non-aromatic structure.

But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is part of a six-membered ring, but they aren't conjugated into an aromatic ring. So, maybe in that case, the tautomerism is possible because the conjugation is only between adjacent carbonyls, not into a benzene-like ring. So, in that case, tautomerism can occur without disrupting an aromatic structure.

Wait, so maybe Benzoquinone cannot tautomerize because the carbonyls are conjugated into the aromatic ring, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because its carbonyls aren't part of an aromatic system.

Therefore, if the question is about which compound does not show tautomerism, Benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism. So, that would mean A is the one that does not show tautomerism. So, answer A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Wait, no, the question says which compound does not show tautomerism. So, if Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, then A is Benzoquinone. But in the given question, the options are between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm, so maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the user says the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, in that case, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. So, maybe the user is correct, and I'm wrong.

Let me look up if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism. Hmm, I don't have direct access to resources, but I think that cyclic ketones can undergo enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione should have tautomerism. So, why does the user say that the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A? Because that would mean it doesn't show tautomerism, which contradicts my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, tautomerism is not possible because the carbonyls are part of an aromatic system, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, since it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyls, it can't tautomerize because of the structure.

Wait, no, actually, in 1,3,5-cyclohexanetrione, the molecule is similar to 1,3-cyclohexadione but with three ketones. So, is that possible? Maybe it's too rigid and can't tautomerize because the positions are fixed. Or maybe it can.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that in benzoquinone, all the oxygen atoms are part of carbonyl groups, so they can't tautomerize. While in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group, so maybe they can tautomerize.

Wait, but the question is about tautomerism, which is typically about enol and keto forms. If a molecule has multiple carbonyl groups, it can have enol forms connecting two carbonyls. So, for example, 1,3-cyclohexanedione can form an enol that connects the two carbonyls. So, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can form a longer conjugated enol form, but since it's a triangle (for five or six-membered rings), maybe it can't form a conjugated enol. Wait, six-membered ring, three carbonyls, so the enol would have to bridge across three carbonyls? That might not be feasible.

Wait, let me think about the structure. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring has three carbonyls. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO in a ring. So, each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So, the positions of the carbonyls are 1, 3, 5. So, if an enol form is to form, it would require a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups moving to a carbonyl carbon, creating a double bond. But would that be possible?

Wait, an enol form would have an -OH group adjacent to a double bond. So, to form that, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyls have two hydrogens each. So, if a hydrogen from a CH2 moves to the adjacent carbonyl carbon, that would create an enol structure.

So, for example, in position 2, next to carbonyl at position 1, there's a CH2 group. So, a hydrogen from C2 can move to C1, creating a double bond between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group would be on C2.

Wait, but then, that would mean that the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the oxygen would be on C2 as an -OH group. Is that feasible? But in a six-membered ring, that might require some flexibility.

But since the ring is rigid, maybe it can't do that. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. If I can't figure it out, maybe I should move on to part B and come back.

Part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center and that chiral center is not plane symmetric, so that it can have non-superimposable mirror images. So, both compounds need to be checked for the presence of a chiral center.

First, let me draw the structures.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3

Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, methyl ester: so the acid is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon, and the ester is formed with methanol.

So, the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's incorrect. Wait, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with -OCH3.

Wait, wait, no. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: The acid is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, esterifying it with methanol would replace the -OH with OCH3, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But hold on, that's the same as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe I should write it as HOCH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester. So, the molecule has a CH2 group attached to the hydroxyl, a COOCH3 group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl, and another CH3 group attached to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's focus on the chiral center. To have optical isomerism, the compound must have a chiral center. So, is there a carbon in either compound with four different substituents?

Starting with methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's see, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, if it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester, the structure is (CH2(OH))CH2COOCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, in that case, the central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- The hydroxyl group (-OH)

- Two CH
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about isomerism. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, it's talking about tautomerism and optical isomerism. I remember that isomers can be divided into two types: constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures, while stereoisomers are mirror images of each other, meaning they have different spatial arrangements but the same connectivity.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's start with part A: identifying which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The given options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Okay, benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Since it's a cyclic compound with two double bonds, I recall that tautomerism usually involves the movement of hydrogen atoms to form different structures, like enols and ketones. Benzoquinone can tautomerize, right? Because it has that keto form which can potentially have enol forms, especially if it's in an acidic environment or under certain conditions.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. So, each of these ketone groups is a carbonyl. I don't think cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. Because all the carbonyls are in a conjugated system. If you try to shift a hydrogen to form an enol, you would have to move a hydrogen from one carbonyl to another. But given the structure, each position is already a ketone, so there are no available hydrogens adjacent to carbonyls that can easily shift without breaking the ring. Therefore, I don't think cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. So, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione because it doesn't show tautomerism.

Moving on to part B: identifying which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, let's consider methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure would be: the central carbon (carbon 2) has an hydroxyl group, an ester group (since it's methyl ester), and two methyl groups attached. Wait, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the formula CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group (ester), and two other groups. Let's count the groups: on carbon 2, we have:

- One hydroxyl (OH)
- One carbonyl (from the ester)
- Two methyl groups? Wait, no, the ester is OCH3, so the carbonyl is connected to OCH3. So, on carbon 2, the substituents would be:

- Two CH3 groups (since it's a propanoate: CH3-C...-COOCH3)
- One OH
- One COOCH3

Wait, no, actually, propanoate would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; but in this case, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of propanoic acid. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, carbon 2 has the hydroxyl group, and the substituents on carbon 2 are:

- One CH2(COOCH3)
- One CH(OH)
- One CH3
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, actually, the structure is more like:

The carboxylic acid is propanoic acid, so the formula is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, no, wait. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is an ester. So, propanoic acid would be CH2CH2COOH, but if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, I think I need to draw it out mentally. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But since it's the methyl ester, the carboxylic acid becomes a methyl ester, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, if the hydroxyl is on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH(COOCH3)CH3? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecule as CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, on the second carbon (the central carbon), there is a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups, but wait, I need to count the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- One OH group
- One COOCH3 group
- Two CH3 groups?

No, that would make five bonds, which isn't possible. Let me clarify.

Propanoate ester: the formula of the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not right. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, that would replace the -OH of the acid with an OCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate, isn't it? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3. So, on the central carbon, there's a CH2 group attached to OH, and on the other side, a COOCH3 group. So, carbon 2: two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formula. The molecular formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be C4H8O4. Let me check:

Propanoic acid is C3H6O2. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, it would be C3H6O3. As an ester, replacing the -OH with -OCH3: so the formula becomes C4H8O4.

Similarly, dimethyl fumarate: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O. Wait, no, fumarate is the conjugated dienoate ester.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H. As a dimethyl ester, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(OOCH3)-CO(OCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct because fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the structure is O=C-OCH2CH2COOCH3 with a double bond?

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans-dienoate ester. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O, but that doesn't seem right because the double bond is between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(OOCH3)-COOCH3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CH-COOCH3 and then another COOCH3 on the same chain? No, that would be a different structure.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. So, the dimethyl ester would be O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O. So, the double bond is between the two CH2 groups? No, fumarate has the double bond between the two central carbons. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O, but that seems to have only one double bond.

Wait, maybe it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O is not correct. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid is 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid? No, no, I think fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, it's a dihydroxy derivative? No, wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is a dienolic acid. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not fumaric acid.

Wait, perhaps fumaric acid is 1,2-dihydroxyethylene? No, no, wait. Fumarate is an alkene dicarboxylate. So, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two central carbons. Wait, but that would make it a diacid.

No, wait, fumaric acid is actually 2,3-dihydroxybutenedioic acid? No, I think fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not right. Maybe I should look at the structure.

Wait, I know that dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O. Wait, no, that's more like a diester with a double bond in between.

Wait, actually, the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O is incorrect because the double bond should be between the carbonyls.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H.

So, fumarate ester would be the dimethyl ester of that: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(OOCH3). So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(OOCH3)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with two ester groups on either side.

So, dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(OOCH3). So, the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons, and each of those carbons is connected to an ester group.

Now, back to methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, on the central carbon (C2), we have a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group (ester), and two other groups. Wait, the carbonyl is part of the ester, so that's one substituent, and the hydroxyl is another. So, on C2, we have:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- One carbonyl group (O)
- Two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the ester. So, the ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, so the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, C2 has:

- One OH
- One COOCH3
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would require four substituents on C2: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3. Wait, that's not correct because propanoate is CH2-CH2-COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, propanoate means a three-carbon chain, with the ester group at the end. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So, carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, on carbon 2, we have a CH group attached to:

- One hydroxyl (OH)
- One CH3 (from carbon 1)
- One COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen.

So, carbon 2 has four substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center because it has four different groups attached.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at carbon 2, which means it can have optical isomers. So, it can show optical isomerism.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate. From earlier, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(OOCH3). The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Now, each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) has two substituents: one ester group and one CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, the molecule is O=C-OCH3 on carbon 1, then a double bond between carbon 2 and 3, and another C=O-OCH3 on carbon 4. So, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O? No, that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, fumarate has a double bond between carbon 2 and 3. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O is incorrect.

Wait, actually, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O with the double bond?

Wait, no. Maybe it's CH2=CH-COOCH3 on both ends. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(OOCH3)=O? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(OOCH3). So, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to an ester group.

In that case, each of the double-bonded carbons (C2 and C3) has the following substituents:

- For C2: one ester group (O=C-OCH3), one CH group, and one double bond.
- For C3: one ester group (O=C-OCH3), one CH group, and one double bond.

Wait, but in terms of tetrahedral geometry, each of these carbons is sp² hybridized, not sp³. So, they don't have four substituents; they have three substituents each (since one bond is a sigma bond from the double bond).

Therefore, C2 and C3 are each connected to two substituents (one ester and one CH group) and one double bond. Since they are part of a double bond, they can't have four substituents. Therefore, these carbons don't have four different groups; they have three substituents each.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because none of the carbons are tetrahedral with four different substituents. So, it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I thought maybe the double bond affects the possibility of cis-trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which requires four different substituents on a carbon.

Therefore, in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it won't show optical isomerism. On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center (C2), so it can have optical isomers.

Wait, but I should double-check the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then yes, C2 is attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. So, yes, it's a chiral center.

Therefore, part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about isomers, specifically about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the question talks about compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures—these are called isomers. There are two types: constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of their atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement.

Now, part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to recall what tautomerism is. Tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen and a pair of electrons, leading to an isomer with a different connectivity. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group and an enol form interconvert.

Benzoquinone is a molecule with two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Its structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the ring, making it a diketone. In benzoquinone, there are no alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) because the carbonyls are directly attached to the benzene ring, which doesn't have any hydrogen atoms on the carbons connected to the oxygen. Without alpha hydrogens, there can't be any enol form, so benzoquinone doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each of these ketones has a carbonyl group, but again, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon in the ring. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (the alpha positions) are all part of the ring structure. Wait, no, in this case, the ring is fully substituted with ketones. Let me visualize it: each carbon in the ring is a carbonyl carbon, so the ring is 1,3,5-tricycliketone. So, each carbonyl carbon is attached to two ring carbons. That means there are no alpha hydrogens, just like in benzoquinone. Hence, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also doesn't have any alpha hydrogens and thus doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, so both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione don't show tautomerism? But the correct answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring. Each carbonyl is directly attached to the ring, so the adjacent carbons (alpha positions) are part of the ring, which are all carbonyls. So, there are no alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone can't tautomerize because there's no enol form possible.

Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each of these ketone groups is attached to the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to each ketone are also part of the ring. Hence, again, no alpha hydrogens. Therefore, neither compound shows tautomerism. So why is the correct answer cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Is there a difference in the structure that I'm missing? Maybe the number of rings or something else. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, so it's a bicyclic structure? Or is it just a substituted benzene? No, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups, so it's a molecule with a benzene ring and two carbonyls attached.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. Each of these ketones has a carbonyl, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, in both cases, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are either part of the aromatic ring or part of the cyclohexane ring, meaning no alpha hydrogens.

Wait, maybe in benzoquinone, the alpha positions are on the benzene ring. So, the carbons attached to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic system. In that case, even if there was a hydrogen, it's part of the aromatic ring and can't easily move to form an enol. So, again, no tautomerism.

So, why is the answer cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Maybe I'm missing something about the number of rings or the stability of the enol form.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can have some resonance or tautomerism that I'm not considering. Wait, benzoquinone is a quinone structure, which can undergo reduction and oxidation. But tautomerism specifically refers to keto-enol type shifts. Since benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens, it can't undergo enol formation. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens either.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the alpha hydrogens in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me draw its structure. It's a six-membered ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl. So, positions 1, 3, and 5 are ketones. That leaves positions 2, 4, and 6 as CH groups, right? So, each of those is attached to a carbonyl group.

Wait, no. Position 1 is a carbonyl, position 2 is CH, position 3 is carbonyl, position 4 is CH, position 5 is carbonyl, position 6 is CH. So, each CH is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Therefore, the CH groups have two carbonyl groups attached, meaning those CH groups are actually quaternary carbons? No, wait. Position 2 is connected to position 1 (carbonyl) and position 3 (carbonyl). So, positions 2, 4, 6 are all CH groups, each with two carbonyl groups attached.

Therefore, each CH group is adjacent to two carbonyls. So, each CH has two alpha hydrogens. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each CH would be a CH2 group, right? Because in a cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2. But in this case, three of the carbons are carbonyls, and the others are CH.

So, if it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then the structure is:

O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O

Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a six-membered ring where positions 1, 3, and 5 are carbonyl groups. So, each of those carbons is a carbonyl, and the others are CH.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CO

Wait, no, that wouldn't make it a ring. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-CH2-O=C

But that doesn't form a ring. No, I must be confusing it with something else.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where three of the carbons are replaced with carbonyl groups. So, for example:

Positions 1, 3, 5: carbonyl groups (O=C-)

Positions 2, 4, 6: CH groups.

So, each CH group is adjacent to two carbonyls.

Therefore, each CH has two alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but that would mean that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, right?

Each CH group is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, so those CH groups have alpha hydrogens. That means cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. But the correct answer says it doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the cyclohexane structure.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the CH groups have alpha hydrogens. In reality, if the cyclohexane ring is fully substituted with three ketones, then the remaining three carbons are CH, and each CH is adjacent to two carbonyl groups.

But in reality, each CH is only adjacent to two carbonyl groups, meaning each CH has two alpha hydrogens. So, that would allow for tautomerism because there are alpha hydrogens.

Wait, then why does the correct answer say cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism?

Maybe I'm confusing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not possible for the enol form to form because the structure is too rigid or something.

Wait, but in reality, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is known as a compound that can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in some reactions, it can form enolates, which suggests that it can tautomerize.

So, perhaps the answer is incorrect? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the structures again.

Benzoquinone: it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-CO. Wait, no, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, which is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as ketones at positions 1 and 4.

This structure has two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is attached directly to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which are sp2 hybridized. Therefore, those positions can't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are already part of the aromatic ring.

Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens and can't tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each of the remaining positions (2, 4, 6) has a CH group. So, each of these CH groups is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, meaning they each have two alpha hydrogens.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. So, why is the correct answer saying that it doesn't show tautomerism?

Wait, perhaps in this case, the compound is too rigid? Or maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would require a different geometry.

Wait, no, because in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the base structure is a chair or boat conformation. If an enol form is possible, it would require the hydroxyl group to form in a position where previously there was a carbonyl.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look up cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to confirm if it can tautomerize.

Wait, I can't actually look things up, so I have to go by my reasoning.

If a compound has alpha hydrogens, it can tautomerize. Since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens, it should be able to tautomerize.

So, then why is the correct answer cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens.

Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but arranged in a ring.

Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, positions 1, 3, 5 are carbonyls, so the positions are 1 (C=O), 2 (CH), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH), 5 (C=O), 6 (CH). So each CH has two adjacent carbonyls.

But in reality, in a six-membered ring with three carbonyls, each CH is only adjacent to one carbonyl?

Wait, no, in a ring, each CH is between two carbonyls. So, for example, position 2 is between 1 (C=O) and 3 (C=O). Similarly, position 4 is between 3 and 5, and position 6 is between 5 and 1.

Wait, so each CH is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Therefore, each CH has two alpha hydrogens.

So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens and can tautomerize. So, why is the correct answer saying it doesn't?

Wait, perhaps the compound is not able to tautomerize because the enol form would require more than one bond breaking, or it's too rigid. Or maybe because the enol would disrupt the ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is wrong.

Wait, no, let's think again. The question is about whether it shows tautomerism. So, tautomerism is possible if there's an enol form.

Wait, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each CH group is between two carbonyls. So, each of these CH groups can lose a proton and form a double bond with one of the adjacent carbonyls.

So, for example, the CH at position 2 can lose a proton and form a double bond between position 2 and 1, which would then create an enol form.

Wait, but position 1 is already a carbonyl. So, maybe forming a double bond between 1 and 2 would give a conjugated dienol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's not possible because the ring is too strained or because the double bond would not be in the right position.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is more stable in its keto form and doesn't tautomerize under normal conditions, but in theory, it can.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that in benzoquinone, the alpha positions are part of the aromatic ring, so no enol can form, whereas in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha positions are part of the ring, but maybe they can still form an enol.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the enol form is not possible because of the ring structure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated into the aromatic ring, making the structure very stable, and preventing tautomerism. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring isn't conjugated like that, so it can undergo tautomerism.

But, if both have alpha hydrogens, then both can tautomerize. So why is the correct answer saying only cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In benzoquinone, the structure is fully conjugated, with the two carbonyl groups part of the aromatic system. So, any enol form would disrupt this conjugation, which is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, the enol form is not possible, and benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring structure is not fully conjugated, as each carbonyl is isolated. Therefore, the enol form is possible because the conjugation isn't as strong. Hence, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize.

Wait, but that contradicts the correct answer. So maybe the correct answer is wrong?

Wait, maybe the question is about whether they show tautomerism under normal conditions or not. Maybe in practice, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize easily because the enol form is less stable or not formed under normal conditions.

But in theory, if it has alpha hydrogens, it can tautomerize. So, perhaps the answer is wrong. Or maybe I'm missing a point.

Wait, going back to the question: it says which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So, the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, meaning that it doesn't show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does. Wait, but I thought benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering. Maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should move on to part B for a moment and come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

So, optical isomerism, also known as stereoisomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's write its structure. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be where the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon of the propanoic acid.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when esterified,
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomers. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are called constitutional isomers, and those with the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements are stereoisomers. The question is asking about two things: tautomerism and optical isomerism.

First, part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does not show tautomerism. Hmm, I need to recall what tautomerism is. Tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen and changes in the double bonds, like in enols and keto forms. For example, compounds with carbonyl groups can tautomerize if there's an alpha hydrogen because the enol form is possible.

Looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, it's O=C-C6H4-C=O. Does benzoquinone have alpha hydrogens? The carbonyl groups are attached directly to the benzene ring, so the carbonyls are only connected to the ring. The ring's carbons are all bonded to two aromatic carbons, so there are no CH groups next to the carbonyl. That means there are no alpha hydrogens, so benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism. 

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That structure is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, each carbonyl is at each alternate carbon. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring. So, again, do these carbonyls have alpha hydrogens? The carbonyl groups are at C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbonyls is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, if there are three ketone groups, each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. Let me visualize it: positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, so each is a C=O. So, the adjacent carbons (2,4,6) would each have two single bonds. The structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, but in a ring, so each CH2 is part of the ring.

Wait, but each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups, but each CH2 group is part of the ring. So, each CH2 is attached to two other CH2 groups. In that case, the carbonyl groups don't have any hydrogen attached to the adjacent carbons because each is connected to two CH2 groups which are part of the ring. Therefore, each carbonyl doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are CH2, but those CH2s are connected to other carbons in the ring, not to the carbonyl's carbon. So, no alpha hydrogens on the carbonyl carbons. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also doesn't have alpha hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question says "the compound that does not show tautomerism." If both don't show tautomerism, then why is the answer A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Maybe I made a mistake in analyzing benzoquinone.

Let me check again. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. The carbonyl carbons are each connected to two benzene carbons. The adjacent carbons to the carbonyl are all aromatic, meaning they are each bonded to two other carbons. So, in benzoquinone, there are no CH groups adjacent to the carbonyls, hence no alpha hydrogens. So benzoquinone cannot tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. But the CH2 groups are in the ring, so they're each attached to two other CH2 groups. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two CH2 groups, but those CH2 groups don't have any hydrogens attached (well, they have two each, but those are part of the ring). Wait, no, each CH2 has two hydrogens. But for tautomerism, we need a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no. Tautomerism involves the movement of an alpha hydrogen. Alpha hydrogen is a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is a CH2 group, which has two hydrogens. Similarly, position 6 is a CH2 group. So, each carbonyl group is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each of which has hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens. That means it can undergo tautomerism, right? Because the enol form is possible.

Wait, so if it has alpha hydrogens, it can tautomerize. So, why is the answer cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Because benzoquinone cannot tautomerize, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can? So, the question is asking which one does NOT show tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot tautomerize, so it's the answer for part A.

Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me think again. Benzoquinone: no alpha hydrogens, so no tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: yes, alpha hydrogens, so it can tautomerize. So, the one that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. But the answer is given as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5, so the adjacent positions are 2,4,6. Each of those positions is a CH2 group. So, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. The hydrogens on the CH2 are alpha hydrogens because they are adjacent to the carbonyl. Therefore, yes, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize. So, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. But in the given answer, it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, either I'm missing something or the answer is incorrect? Or maybe I confused the structures.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone is para-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring, and in that case, the adjacent carbons are not CH groups but part of the ring. So, no alpha hydrogens. So, no tautomerism. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: if each ketone has two adjacent CH2 groups, so the CH2 groups are next to the carbonyl. Therefore, yes, alpha hydrogens. So, the answer for A is benzoquinone, but the given answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm.

Wait, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the adjacent carbons are all CH2 groups, and each CH2 is adjacent to two more CH2 groups, so the CH2 is not connected to any other carbonyl. So, in that case, the CH2 groups have two hydrogens each, so alpha hydrogens. Therefore, can undergo enol tautomerism. So, the only compound without tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So, perhaps the initial answer given is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again.

So, for tautomerism, the compound needs to have the ability to tautomerize, i.e., have an alpha hydrogen. If a compound doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, it cannot tautomerize. So, if both compounds don't have alpha hydrogens, neither can tautomerize.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, each attached to two aromatic carbons. The adjacent carbons are all part of the aromatic ring, which are all sp² hybridized, so they have only one hydrogen each. No, wait, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl in benzoquinone are each bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen. So, each adjacent carbon has one hydrogen. So, the carbonyl is at position 1, then position 2 has a hydrogen. So, position 2 has one hydrogen, but is that an alpha hydrogen? 

Wait, an alpha hydrogen is a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, yes, the hydrogen on position 2 is an alpha hydrogen. So, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, it can tautomerize. Wait, that changes things.

Hold on, so in benzoquinone, the carbonyl is at position 1, so position 2 is adjacent, has an H. Similarly, position 6 is adjacent to position 1, has an H as well. So, both positions 2 and 6 have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. So, both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. Hmm, but that's conflicting with the initial thought.

Wait, but wait, in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of an aromatic ring. So, is the hydrogen on those carbons considered alpha? Or is it that because those carbons are sp² hybridized, the hydrogen is not an alpha hydrogen? No, I think alpha position refers to being adjacent regardless of hybridization. So, any hydrogen on the carbon next to the carbonyl is alpha, regardless of whether it's sp² or sp³. So, in benzoquinone, even though the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring (sp²), their hydrogens are still alpha. So, benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has each carbonyl group adjacent to two CH2 groups, which have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, both compounds can tautomerize, so neither can be the correct answer for A. But the given answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are each bonded to two other carbons (in the aromatic ring), so they have only one hydrogen each. So, each adjacent carbon has only one hydrogen, but that is still an alpha hydrogen. So, benzoquinone can tautomerize. So, both can tautomerize, so neither is the correct answer. But that's conflicting with the given answer.

Wait, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are at 1,3,5, so each adjacent carbon is a CH2. So, each has two hydrogens, which are alpha hydrogens. So, yes, can tautomerize. So, why is the answer cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Or maybe the answer is referring to the possibility of keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring structure is such that the enol form is not possible because the ring would break. No, that doesn't make sense. The ring can adjust to form the enol. Hmm, perhaps it's because of the ring strain? No, cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring, which is not too strained.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing with another concept. Maybe in some cases, tautomerism is not observed due to stability or other factors. But generally, if a compound has alpha hydrogens, it can tautomerize. So, both can.

This is confusing. Maybe part A is about enol vs keto tautomer. Benzoquinone is a diketone, so it can tautomerize to the enol form. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize as well. So, why is cyclohexane the one that does not show tautomerism? Maybe I need to check another approach.

Wait, perhaps in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is such that each carbonyl is at 1,3,5 positions, so the ring is fully conjugated. So, maybe it's more stable in the keto form and doesn't tautomerize as readily? Or maybe it's a case of tautomerism where the molecule might not actually tautomerize in practice because the transition state is very high in energy. But I don't recall that being the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the presence of enol form. Maybe benzoquinone can't form an enol because of the ring structure, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. But that doesn't make sense because both can form enol.

Wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me count again.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two hydrogens. So, for each carbonyl, there are two alpha hydrogens on each adjacent CH2. So, three carbonyls, each with two alpha hydrogens on two sides, but each CH2 is shared between two carbonyls. So, the total number of alpha hydrogens is 6. So, yes, plenty of alpha hydrogens, so can tautomerize.

So, both compounds have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. Therefore, neither can be the answer. But the given answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the given answer is incorrect, but assuming the answer is correct, perhaps for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the adjacent carbons are not CH2 but something else, but no, it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketones. So, each carbonyl is at a position, making the adjacent positions CH2.

So, maybe I should accept that the answer is given as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, so perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both can tautomerize. Maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is such that it's not possible to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, no, each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH2 groups, which have hydrogens.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should move on to part B and see if that clarifies something.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents on a carbon atom. 

First, let's analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3

So, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to:

- A methyl group (from the ester, COOCH3)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two CH3 groups from the CH3 and the other side.

Wait, let's draw it:

The carbon chain is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3

So, the middle carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from the first CH3)
- One COOCH3 group
- One OH group
- One CH2 (from the adjacent carbon?)

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me represent it as:

The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

So, the central carbon is the second carbon, which has:

- One CH3 group (from the first carbon)
- One COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
- One OH group
- One H (since the hydroxyl is on the second carbon)

Wait, so the second carbon has four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, is that a chiral center? Because if all four groups are different, then it is chiral. So, CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Yes, these are four different groups, so the second carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. 

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the conjugated dicarboxylate.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this chemistry question about isomers, specifically constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. The question is asking why cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the correct answer for part A, which concerns tautomerism, and why methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the correct answer for part B, concerning optical isomerism.

First, let me recall the concepts involved here. Tautomerism refers to the isomerism in which parts of a molecule can be rearranged into another form by the movement of substituents, without breaking the molecular structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can rearrange into an enol form, which has an alcohol group.

On the other hand, optical isomerism, or stereoisomerism, arises when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning a carbon atom is bonded to four different atoms. This results in the molecule being able to exist in two mirror-image forms, called enantiomers. If a molecule has multiple chiral centers, it can have multiple stereoisomers, including the possibility of being meso compounds, which are not chiral because of an internal plane of symmetry.

Starting with part A: Why is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione the correct answer? The compound given is benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Let me sketch the structure in my mind. Benzoquinone is a six-membered aromatic ring with two ketone groups. Depending on the positions, it could be 1,4-benzoquinone or 1,2-benzoquinone. Wait, but the question says benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

So, benzoquinone would have two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. Wait, but a cyclohexane ring can't have three ketone groups unless it's a cyclic structure. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, making it a cyclic structure with alternating single and double bonds? Hmm, perhaps in a conjugated form.

Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. But in reality, a six-membered ring with three ketone groups would have the structure where each ketone is separated by one carbon. So, positions 1, 3, 5. That's every other carbon, so it's a 1,3,5-tricyclic compound? Or perhaps it's a triketone.

But in terms of tautomerism, tautomerism typically occurs when there's a possibility of rearrangement, such as in enol and keto forms. For a molecule to show tautomerism, it should have the capability to shift between different structural forms.

Considering benzoquinone: it's a fully conjugated aromatic compound. If it's 1,4-benzoquinone, then it's similar in structure to benzene but with two ketone groups. Does this allow for tautomerism? Well, in aromatic compounds, the structure is rigid, and the double bonds are delocalized. The aromatic system is stabilized, so there's not much incentive for tautomerism. The carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic system, so moving them around would break the aromaticity, but maybe in some cases, it can happen.

Wait, quinones are known for exhibiting tautomerism. For instance, 1,4-benzoquinone can tautomerize to form a dihydro form, adding hydrogen across one of the double bonds. But wait, is that correct? Actually, quinones are typically in the keto form. The enol form of quinones is less common because keto is more stable due to the conjugation.

But wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: that's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, each carbon in the ring is connected to a ketone. So, is this possible? Let me think. If it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, 5, each of those carbons would have a double bond to oxygen. So, the structure would be O=C-R-C(=O)-R-C(=O)-R, but in a ring. Wait, but for a six-membered ring, if three of the carbons are carbonyl groups, that actually would make the ring have alternating single and double bonds, but in such a way that each double bond is between a carbonyl carbon and a regular carbon.

But in reality, such a structure is not possible because each carbonyl group would require a double bond, but for three carbonyl groups in a ring, the ring would have to be fully conjugated with alternating double bonds. Wait, that would be like having a six-membered ring with three double bonds, but that might not be feasible because each double bond needs two adjacent atoms.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene, but with ketones. No, wait, a triketone would have three C=O groups. So, each carbonyl is a double bond to O, so each of those carbons would have two bonds. To form a ring, each carbonyl carbon would be connected to two other carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is similar to cyclohexenone but with three ketones. Wait, but cyclohexane is a saturated ring, so putting three ketone groups would require breaking the saturation. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have to have alternating double bonds between the carbonyl groups.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider if such a structure is possible. If you have a six-membered ring, each with a carbonyl group at positions 1, 3, and 5, then each of these carbonyls would be separated by a single bond. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but in a ring.

Wait, but that would require the ring to have alternating single and double bonds. So, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but arranged in a ring with double bonds between the carbonyls. So each O=C is connected to a CH2 group, and then the next O=C, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, maybe it's 1,3,5-cyclohexanetrione. So, positions 1, 3, 5 have ketone groups, and the other positions are CH2 groups. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but to make a ring, the last CH2 would have to connect back to the first O=C, but that would require four bonds, which isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fully conjugated triketone, like 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene-1,3,5-trione? But that doesn't make much sense either because the ring would need to have alternating double bonds, but each double bond is between a carbonyl and a regular carbon.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic compound with three carbonyl groups, each separated by a single bond. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but to form a ring, each CH2 would need to connect back to the previous O=C, forming a ring. But that would require the carbons to be connected as O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-O=C, but that creates a bridge or a cross structure, which is not possible in a single ring.

So, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a non-planar structure, or maybe it's not possible. Wait, but perhaps it is. If I imagine a six-membered ring where three of the carbons are carbonyl carbons, each with a double bond to O, and the other three are CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. But in that case, the ring would have alternating single and double bonds, but with each double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugated dienone or something. Wait, but three carbonyls would make it a triketone. Hmm. Now, thinking about tautomerism, in such a compound, can the carbonyl groups shift positions? For example, could a carbonyl move from one position to another by a hydride shift or a proton shift?

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are at 1, 3, and 5. If one of the CH2 groups could become a carbonyl, then the structure could tautomerize. But each carbonyl is at every other carbon, so shifting one would require breaking the ring. It's unclear if such a tautomerism is possible.

On the other hand, benzoquinone: 1,4-benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If it were to tautomerize, perhaps one of the ketones could become an enol. But given the aromaticity of the benzene ring, the enol form would disrupt the conjugation. However, quinones can undergo enolization because the enol form can still be aromatic due to resonance.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the aromatic system is too rigid. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because it's not fully conjugated? Wait, if it's 1,3,5-tricyclic, perhaps the ring isn't fully conjugated, allowing for tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Tautomerism is most common in compounds with hydrogen atoms that can shift, allowing the rearrangement. For example, enol and keto tautomerism involve the movement of a hydrogen. So, if a compound has alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group), it can show tautomerism.

So, let's check each compound. Benzoquinone: it has carbonyl groups, but are there alpha hydrogens? In benzoquinone, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are each attached to two oxygen atoms and two benzene carbons. Therefore, the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons (alpha positions) don't have hydrogen atoms. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is already bonded to three other carbons and one hydrogen. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the benzene ring and don't have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens and cannot show tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each carbonyl group is attached to a CH2 group. So, each carbonyl has an alpha carbon with two hydrogens attached. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens. If a proton can shift from one carbonyl to another, the compound can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but how? The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. The alpha hydrogens are on these CH2 groups. So, if one of the CH2 groups loses a hydrogen and gains it from another, can that form a different structure? Or maybe a hydride shift occurs, leading to a different arrangement.

But wait, in order for tautomerism, the molecule needs to be able to rearrange without breaking the ring. If a hydrogen moves from one alpha carbon to another, that could create a new carbonyl position. However, given the positions of the carbonyls at 1, 3, and 5, moving a hydrogen from position 2 (if it's a CH2) to position 4 might not lead to a different carbonyl arrangement because of the ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism by moving a hydrogen from one CH2 group to an adjacent carbonyl carbon, effectively shifting the double bond.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is separated by two CH2 groups. So, if a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups can shift to an adjacent carbonyl, it might create a new carbonyl position. But in a six-membered ring, moving a hydrogen from one CH2 to another might result in a different arrangement, but I'm not sure if that would disrupt the ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound can open up into a different structure, but that would not be tautomerism because it would involve breaking the ring.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should compare the two compounds. Benzoquinone has no alpha hydrogens, so no tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens, so it can show tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism, while benzoquinone cannot. So, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone, but the question says that the correct answer for A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That seems contradictory.

Wait, hold on. The question is asking for the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism, then it would not be the correct answer for A. Instead, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone, which cannot tautomerize because it lacks alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but the given answer is that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens in a way that allows tautomerism.

Wait, let me think again. If a compound has alpha hydrogens, it can show tautomerism. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, each of those CH2 groups has two alpha hydrogens. Therefore, in theory, those can shift. For example, a hydrogen from a CH2 group could move to become bonded to the adjacent carbonyl carbon, creating a new carbonyl group.

So, that would allow for tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism, while benzoquinone cannot because of the lack of alpha hydrogens.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone, so why is the answer saying that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says, "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)." So, A is the one without tautomerism, which would be benzoquinone, but the given answer says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl groups because all the alpha positions are occupied by other groups.

Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure would have CH2 groups between the carbonyls. So, for example, the structure would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but in a ring. So, the CH2 groups are between the carbonyls. Therefore, each CH2 has two hydrogen atoms, which are alpha hydrogens. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens and can show tautomerism.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone, since it lacks alpha hydrogens. So, why is the answer saying that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying whether benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens. Let me think again. Benzoquinone: structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, each ketone is attached to a carbon on the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons on the benzene ring have hydrogen atoms. So, are these considered alpha hydrogens?

Wait, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the carbonyls) are each bonded to two other benzene carbons and one hydrogen. So, these hydrogens are ortho to the carbonyl groups. But in terms of alpha carbons, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. In this case, the alpha carbon is part of the aromatic ring, so it might not have a hydrogen? Wait, no, in aromatic rings, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen. So, the alpha carbon is part of the aromatic ring, so it has one hydrogen.

Wait, does that count as alpha hydrogen? Because in alkenes and alkanes, the alpha carbons
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It asks which one does not show tautomerism, and the answer is supposed to be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Then, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, it asks which one shows optical isomerism, and the answer is supposed to be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. I need to understand why these answers are correct.

Starting with tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the rearrangement of a molecule into a different structural form without changing the molecular formula. The two types of tautomerism are enol-tautomerism and keto-enol tautomerism, which involve the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond between two carbons. 

Benzoquinone is a compound with the structure of a benzene ring with two ketone groups. I remember that benzoquinone can tautomerize. Specifically, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism by moving the double bond between the carbonyl carbons and the ring, converting between o-benzoquinone and p-benzoquinone. So, benzoquinone does show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That structure has three ketone groups attached to a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. I think about whether this compound can undergo tautomerism. Each carbonyl group is on a carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. For tautomerism to occur, there needs to be a possibility to rearrange a hydrogen and a double bond. But in a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each carbonyl is at a position that's already part of the ring. 

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at a meta position. For enol or keto-enol tautomerism, you typically need adjacent carbonyl groups or the ability to move a hydrogen between carbons that are connected or adjacent. In this cyclohexane structure, the carbonyl groups are separated by two carbons. That is, the carbonyl at position 1 is adjacent to the ring carbons at 2 and 6, which are not carbonyls. So, moving a double bond from one carbonyl to another might not be possible because the necessary adjacent hydrogen isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the molecule can achieve planarity to allow for tautomerism. But in 1,3,5-tricyclohexane, all the carbonyl groups are in fixed positions. I think that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because there's no adjacent hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon. Each carbonyl is on a carbon that's already part of the ring, and moving a hydrogen would require a neighboring carbon with a hydrogen, which isn't the case here.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone does. So, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, moving on to part B: optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, also known as stereoisomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, causing the molecule to have a stereocenter and thus the ability to exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the two compounds: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is a central carbon (the second carbon) attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), an ester group (O-CO-OCH3). Wait, let me draw that out. The formula is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four substituents: a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, a carboxylic acid methyl ester, and a hydrogen? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. 

The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoate part is CH2(COOCH3)CH3. But with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's clarify. The formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to (from left to right): CH3, a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group, and a carbonyl group as part of the ester. Wait, that's not possible because carbon 2 cannot have two carbonyl groups. Maybe I have the structure wrong.

Alternative approach: The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so its structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, in this case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the central carbon: in this case, the second carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) is attached to what groups?

Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the second carbon from the left is the CH2 connected to the hydroxyl. Wait, that's only two substituents. Maybe I need to number differently.

If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl, so it's connected to:

- One CH2(OH) group? No, wait, let's number the carbons.

Propanoate has three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the second, then the third. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: ?

Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2.

Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

Propanoate is O=C-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is HOCH2-C(COOCH3)-CH3? That would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- A hydroxyl group (-OH),

- A carboxylic acid ester group (COOCH3),

- A methyl group (CH3),

- A hydrogen.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to four different groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and H. That makes carbon 2 a chiral center because it has four different substituents. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, looking at dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which has a structure with two double bonds. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. When esterified, it becomes the dimethyl ester: CH2=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, dimethyl fumarate is (CH=CH) linked between two ester groups: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)? No, wait, that's not fumarate.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when we take the diacid and make the dimethyl ester, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3). So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3). In this structure, the double bond is between the two central carbons (CH=CH). Are these carbons each bonded to two ester groups and one double bond?

So, in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is connected to an ester group. Each of these carbons (let's call them carbons 2 and 3) have two ester groups and a double bond. So, structure is:

O
||O
C-OCH3 connected to CH=CH connected to another C-OCH3.

So, the carbons involved in the double bond each have two ester groups attached? Let me think.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

So, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to two ester groups. Wait, no. Each of the central carbons is connected to one ester group and one double bond. So, each of the central carbons is bonded to: an ester group, a double bond, and two other carbons (one from each side). Wait, no. Let me try:

The full structure would be:

(CH3O)CO-CH2-CH2-CO(CH3O). But that's not fumarate. Wait, fumarate is (CH2=CH) between two COOCH3 groups. So, it's (COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3)? No, that's not fumarate.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, when you make the dimethyl ester, each carboxylic acid becomes a methyl ester. So, the structure is (COOCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Therefore, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this case, the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons (2 and 3) is bonded to a COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups? No, wait, each of these central carbons is bonded to two CH groups because it's a double bond.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for dimethyl succinate, but for fumarate, it's COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, in fumarate, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to COOCH3, a double bond, and two CH groups? Wait, no.

Actually, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- Two CH groups (since it's a double bond between C2 and C3),

- And another CH2 group on each end? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3 connected to CH=CH connected to another C-OCH3.

So, the double bond is in the middle, each with an ester group. Therefore, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

- One ester group (COOCH3),

- Two hydrogens (because the structure is CH=CH),

- And the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3,

- Two CH2 groups,

Wait, maybe it's better to count the substituents.

Each double-bonded carbon (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2,

- Another CH2,

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's consider the actual structure.

The structure is:

O
||
C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-C-OCH3
||
O

No, that's succinate, not fumarate. For fumarate, the double bond is in the middle.

So, correct structure:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Therefore, each of the double-bonded carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- One CH2 group on one side,

- One CH2 group on the other side.

Wait, no. Each double-bonded carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2 on one side,

Wait, perhaps not. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: CH2=CH,

Wait, no. It's actually each double-bonded carbon (C2 and C3) has:

- One COOCH3 group,

- Two CH2 groups,

Wait, that can't be, because each double bond has two carbons, each with two substituents.

Wait, perhaps each double-bonded carbon is bonded to: COOCH3, H, and two CH2 groups? No, that can't be. Let me try again.

Wait, in the ester form, each carbonyl is O=C-OCH3. Then, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the structure is: O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, but for fumarate, it's O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, in fumarate, between the two carbonyl groups, there's a double bond.

Therefore, the double bond is between C2 and C3. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- One carbonyl group (O=C-OCH3),

- One CH group (since it's a double bond between C2 and C3),

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- For C2: COOCH3, CH2 (from the CH2=CH), but that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, which is succinate, and COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3 is fumarate.

So, in the fumarate, each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group,

- One CH group (as part of the double bond),

- And two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3,

- Two CH2 groups,

But that would mean each carbon is CH2, which is not correct because they are part of the double bond.

Wait, maybe each double-bonded carbon is bonded to:

- One COOCH3,

- One CH,

- And two CH2 groups? No, that doesn't make sense.

I think I need to clarify this. Let's consider each carbon in the double bond.

In fumarate, the structure is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, and COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3 for fumarate. So, in fumarate, C2 and C3 each have:

- One COOCH3 group,

- One double bond,

- And two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, that can't be because then each would have four bonds.

Wait, more accurately, each double-bonded carbon is bonded to:

- One ester group (COOCH3),

- Two CH2 groups.

But that would make each carbon have three substituents, but it's a double bond, so each should have two substituents on each side.

Wait, maybe it's that the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is bonded to an ester group and a CH2 group. So, each double-bonded carbon is CH2 connected to the ester.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead check whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. For optical isomerism, you need a chiral center, which requires four different substituents on a carbon.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric. The molecule has a central double bond with two ester groups on either side. So, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane of the double bond. Therefore, the groups on each side of the double bond are the same. So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two CH2 groups and one est
