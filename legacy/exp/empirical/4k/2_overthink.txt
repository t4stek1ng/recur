[overthinking]
Okay, let's try to figure out how much water is left to fill the tank. So, the tank can hold 18,000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B are working together over two days to fill it up. I need to break down their contributions each day.

First, let's get clear on what each person did on each day.

**Day 1:**
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. So, how much is that in gallons? Well, 1/4 of 18,000 is 4,500 gallons. So, Wanda pumped in 4,500 gallons on day one.
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda. So, Ms. B pumped 3/4 of 4,500. Let me calculate that: 4,500 * 3/4 = 3,375 gallons. So, Ms. B added 3,375 gallons on day one.

So, combined on day one, they put in 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

**Day 2:**
- Now, on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day one. She did 4,500 gallons on day one, so 2/3 of that is 4,500 * 2/3. Let me do that: 4,500 divided by 3 is 1,500, so 1,500 * 2 is 3,000 gallons. So, Wanda pumps in 3,000 gallons on day two.
- Ms. B, on the other hand, only pumps 1/3 of what she did on day one. She did 3,375 gallons on day one, so 1/3 of that is 3,375 / 3. Let me compute that: 3,375 divided by 3 is 1,125 gallons. So, Ms. B pumps in 1,125 gallons on day two.

So, together on day two, they add 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
Now, let's add up the water they've pumped over both days.

Day 1: 7,875 gallons
Day 2: 4,125 gallons
Total pumped: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Wait, so if they've pumped 12,000 gallons into the tank, how much is left to fill it? The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. Hmm. That doesn't match my calculation. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Let me read it again.

"A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full? Why the correct answer is: 12000?"

Wait, hold on. Maybe I misread something. The tank is being filled by pumping water into it, but the total pumped water is 12,000. So, if the tank is filled with 12,000 gallons, then it's not full yet because the capacity is 18,000.

But the problem says "How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?" which would be 18,000 - pumped gallons.

But according to my calculation, 12,000 gallons have been pumped, so 6,000 remain. But the correct answer is 12,000, so perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe they are pumping out water, or maybe it's not pumped into the tank but from it? Let me check the problem again.

It says, "to pump water from a pond to fill the tank." So, they are filling the tank by pumping water into it. So, the total pumped water is added to the tank. So, the amount remaining is 18,000 minus the total pumped. So, according to me, 12,000 pumped, so 6,000 remaining. But the answer is 12,000 remaining, meaning that 6,000 has been pumped.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the interpretation.

Wait, if the tank is being filled with 12,000 gallons, then it's not full, so 12,000 is remaining? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The capacity is 18,000, so 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000. So, 6,000 is remaining.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the total pumped.

Let me re-examine day one.

First day:

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. 1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. So, Wanda added 4,500.

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda. So, 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

But is Ms. B pumping out water or adding water? Wait, the problem says they are pumping water from a pond to fill the tank. So, both are adding water into the tank, right?

So, Wanda is filling 1/4, which is adding water, and Ms. B is pumping 3/4 as much as Wanda, so also adding water.

So, the total on day one is 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875.

On day two:

- Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on the previous day. So, 2/3 of 4,500 is 3,000. So, she pumps out 3,000 gallons on day two. But wait, is she pumping into the tank or out? No, the question says they are pumping water into the tank. So, if Wanda pumps, she is adding water. So, 3,000 gallons on day two.

Wait, but if the tank is being filled, why is she pumping on day two? Wait, no, she's still filling it. So, whether she's pumping into the tank or from another source? Wait, the wording is: "pumped water from a pond to fill the tank."

So, both Wanda and Ms. B are taking water from the pond and pumping it into the tank. So, on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank with water, meaning she added 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much, so she added 3,375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. So, previous day she added 4,500, so 2/3 is 3,000. So, she adds another 3,000. Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So, she added 3,375 on day one, so 1/3 is 1,125. So, she adds 1,125 on day two.

So, total water added on day one: 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875.

Total water added on day two: 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125.

Total water added over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Therefore, the tank has 12,000 gallons in it, so the remaining is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So, I must have misinterpreted something.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days."

So, maybe they are pumping water from the pond into the tank, but perhaps the wording is that they are each responsible for pumping a certain amount, but the contributions are being subtracted from the pond's water. Wait, no, the problem says "to fill the tank," so they are adding water to the tank.

Wait, hold on, maybe the problem is not that they are both adding water into the tank, but rather, one is filling the tank while the other is pumping out water? Let me read again.

"On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day."

Wait, hold on. So, on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4, so that is adding 4,500 gallons into the tank. Then Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. Wait, does that mean Ms. B pumped 3/4 of 4,500 gallons, which is 3,375 gallons, from the tank? Or from the pond?

Wait, the problem says they are pumping water from the pond to fill the tank. So, both are adding water into the tank. So, Wanda fills 1/4, Ms. B adds 3/4 as much. So, together, they add 1/4 + 3/4 = 1 tank on the first day.

Wait, that seems contradictory because 1/4 + 3/4 is 1, but the problem says Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda. So, if Wanda added 4,500, Ms. B added 3,375. So, total is 7,875, which is 7,875 / 18,000 = 0.4375, so 7/16 of the tank on day one.

Then on day two, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day. So, 2/3 of 4,500 is 3,000. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So, 1/3 of 3,375 is 1,125.

So, on day two, they add 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons. So, 12,000 gallons pumped into the tank, so 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 remaining.

Wait, so why is the correct answer 12,000? Maybe I have to reverse it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the tank's capacity is 18,000, but they are pumping water out of it, rather than into it? Wait, the problem says they are pumping water from a pond to fill the tank. So, it's from the pond into the tank.

But if 12,000 gallons are pumped into the tank, then the remaining is 6,000.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So, maybe I misread the problem?

Wait, perhaps on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda filled, meaning that Ms. B is removing 3/4 as much as Wanda added, so net water added is 1/4 - 3/4 = negative, which would be removing water. But that doesn't make sense because they are trying to fill the tank.

Wait, maybe the problem is that Wanda is filling the tank, and Ms. B is pumping water out. Wait, but the problem says they are both pumping water from a pond to fill the tank. So, perhaps both are adding water.

Wait, let me try to parse this again.

"On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day."

Wait, perhaps "pumped into the tank" is the key. So, Wanda is filling 1/4, and Ms. B is pumping 3/4 as much as Wanda pumped into the tank. So, if Wanda pumps into the tank 4,500 gallons, then Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that, which is 3,375 gallons. So, both are adding into the tank, but the rates are different.

So, on day one: Wanda adds 4,500, Ms. B adds 3,375. So, total added 7,875.

On day two: Wanda pumps 2/3 of her previous day's amount, which was 4,500, so 3,000. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her previous day's amount, which was 3,375, so 1,125. So, they add 3,000 and 1,125 on day two, for a total of 4,125.

So, total over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000. So, 12,000 gallons in the tank, meaning 6,000 remains.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So, maybe the question is asking how much is remaining to be pumped, not in the tank.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that Wanda and Ms. B are the ones who have to fill the tank by pumping, so the total amount they can pump is 12,000, so the remaining is 12,000 gallons which needs to be pumped.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think of it in terms of their pumping rates.

Wait, on day one, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 4,500 gallons. Then Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda filled, which is 3,375 gallons.

But perhaps the way they are working is that Wanda is filling the tank, and Ms. B is also filling it but with less.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around: Wanda is filling and Ms. B is emptying? No, the problem says they are pumping water from a pond to fill the tank, so both are adding water.

Wait, another thought: maybe the capacity is 18,000, and they have to pump 18,000 gallons in two days. So, if each day they pump a certain amount, and after two days, they have only pumped 12,000, so 6,000 is still needed. But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000 remaining.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find how much water they pumped in total, which is 12,000, so the remaining in the pond is 12,000 gallons. But the tank is only 18,000. So, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I need to model their rates.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote Wanda’s rate as W and Ms. B’s rate as M.

On day one:

Wanda filled 1/4 tank, which is 4,500 gallons. So, W = 4,500 gallons per day? Wait, no, because she only did this on the first day. Wait, perhaps their rates are constant.

Wait, maybe I should think of per hour rates, but the problem doesn’t specify time. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of daily contributions.

On day one:

- Wanda filled 1/4 tank: 4,500 gallons.

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda: 3,375 gallons.

So, on day one, together, they filled 7,875 gallons.

On day two:

- Wanda pumped 2/3 of her previous day’s amount. Her previous day she filled 4,500, so she pumps 2/3 of that into the tank? Wait, if she's pumping, is she emptying or filling? Wait, no, the problem says they are pumping water from the pond to fill the tank, so they are adding water. So, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on day one, so 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

Similarly, Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she did on day one, so 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

So, on day two, they add 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

Total over two days: 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Therefore, the tank has 12,000 gallons, so 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons remaining.

But the problem says the correct answer is 12,000, so perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking how much is remaining to be pumped, rather than the remaining capacity. So, if they have only pumped 12,000 gallons into the tank, then the remaining to be pumped is 6,000 gallons. But again, 12,000 is the total pumped, not the remaining.

Wait, now I'm confused because the problem says the correct answer is 12,000. So, maybe 12,000 is the amount remaining in the pond, not in the tank. If the tank is 18,000, and they pumped 12,000 into it, then 6,000 is in the tank, and 12,000 is in the pond. But the question is about the tank, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that on day one, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda did. So, net water in the tank is 1/4 - 3/4 = negative, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Wait, no, because they
