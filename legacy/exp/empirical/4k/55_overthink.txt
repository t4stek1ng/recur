Alright, so I came across this physics problem, and I want to try to figure it out step by step. Let me write down my thoughts as I go along.

The question is about a photon striking an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed in the process, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. We need to find the energy of the photon, with the options being A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc². The correct answer is given as B, 2mc², but I want to understand why.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. A photon is a particle of light with zero mass and energy. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency or wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

An electron has mass m and when it's at rest, its energy is purely its rest mass energy, which is mc². When the photon hits the electron, it transfers energy to it, causing the electron to become excited. But in this case, the photon is destroyed, creating a positron and two electrons. So, energy conservation must be at play here.

Let me outline what's happening step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The photon with energy E is moving towards an electron of mass m at rest. The electron has energy mc² because it's at rest.

2. **After Collision**: The photon is absorbed, and the electron-positron pair is created. So, the resulting particles are a positron (which has the same mass as an electron) and two electrons. Therefore, in total, we have three particles: two electrons and one positron, all moving with the same speed v.

Since all three particles are moving, their kinetic energies must be considered. Also, because the positron and electrons are moving, their rest mass energies will still contribute to the total energy.

Now, applying the conservation of energy and momentum.

**Energy Conservation**:
The initial total energy is the energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the electron.

E_initial = E_photon + mc²

After the collision, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic energies and rest energies of the three particles. Since they all move at the same speed v, their kinetic energies can be expressed using the relativistic kinetic energy formula. But wait, since they are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, should I use relativistic or classical kinetic energy?

The problem doesn't specify, but in particle physics, especially when dealing with pair production, we usually use relativistic energies because the speeds can approach c. However, since the options are given in terms of mc², which is a rest mass term, maybe we can model this with non-relativistic kinetic energy. Hmm, but that might be an oversight. Let me think.

If I use relativistic kinetic energy, the total energy of each particle would be:

E = γ mc²

where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But since all three particles have the same velocity v, their total energy would be 3γ mc².

But wait, the positron also has rest mass energy mc², same as the electrons. So, the total energy after the collision should be:

E_after = 3γ mc² + 2mc² (Wait, why 2mc²? No, each particle has rest mass energy mc², so three particles would have 3mc². But actually, positron has mc², and two electrons each have mc², so 3mc² in total. So E_after = 3γ mc² + 3mc²? Wait, no, the rest energy is already included in the γ mc² term. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The rest energy is mc² for each particle. When they are moving, their total energy is γ mc² each. So total energy after collision is 3γ mc². But their rest energy is also 3mc². So total energy is 3γ mc².

But the initial energy is E_photon + mc².

So,

E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc²

But we don't know γ yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the center of momentum frame. Since all particles move in the same direction, the frame is moving at velocity v with respect to the initial rest frame.

But perhaps it's simpler to consider momentum as well as energy.

**Momentum Conservation**:

The photon has momentum p = E/c.

After the collision, the total momentum is the sum of the momenta of the three particles. Since they all move at the same speed v, their momenta will be p = γ mv in the direction of motion.

Therefore, the total momentum after collision is 3γ mv.

So, from momentum conservation:

E_photon / c = 3γ mv

Therefore, E_photon = 3γ mv c.

Now, from energy conservation:

E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc².

Substituting E_photon from the momentum equation into the energy equation:

3γ mv c + mc² = 3γ mc²

Subtract 3γ mc² from both sides:

3γ mv c + mc² - 3γ mc² = 0

Factor out mc²:

mc² (1 - 3γ) + 3γ mv c = 0

Wait, maybe I need to express v in terms of γ or vice versa.

Since we have E_photon = 3γ mv c, and also E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc².

Wait, perhaps I need to write both equations:

From energy: E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc².

From momentum: E_photon = 3γ mv c.

Therefore, equate the two expressions:

3γ mc² - mc² = 3γ mv c

Let me factor out mc² on the left:

mc² (3γ - 1) = 3γ mv c

Divide both sides by c:

mc² (3γ - 1)/c = 3γ mv

Simplify:

mc² (3γ - 1) = 3γ mv c

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express v in terms of γ.

From the momentum equation:

E_photon = 3γ mv c => v = (E_photon) / (3γ m c).

But E_photon from energy equation is E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc².

So,

v = (3γ mc² - mc²) / (3γ m c) = [c² (3γ - 1)] / (3γ c) = c (3γ - 1)/(3γ)

Simplify:

v = c (1 - 1/(3γ))

Okay, so now I have expressions for v in terms of γ.

But I can also relate v and γ through the relativistic relation:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Let me set v = c (1 - 1/(3γ)) into this.

First, let me denote v = c (1 - 1/(3γ)).

So, v/c = 1 - 1/(3γ).

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - [1 - 1/(3γ)]² = 1 - [1 - 2/(3γ) + 1/(9γ²)] = 2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)

Therefore, γ = 1 / sqrt(2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²))

Let me square both sides:

γ² = 1 / [2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)]

Multiply numerator and denominator by 9γ² to eliminate denominators:

γ² = 1 / [ (6γ² - 1) / (9γ²) ] = 9γ² / (6γ² - 1)

So,

γ² (6γ² - 1) = 9γ²

Expand left side:

6γ⁴ - γ² = 9γ²

Bring all terms to one side:

6γ⁴ - γ² - 9γ² = 0 => 6γ⁴ -10γ²=0

Factor:

2γ²(3γ² -5)=0

Solutions: γ²=0 or 3γ²-5=0

γ=0 is trivial, so 3γ²=5 => γ²=5/3 => γ= sqrt(5/3)

So, γ=√(5/3)

So, now, going back to energy conservation:

E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc² = mc²(3γ -1)

We have γ=√(5/3), so:

E_photon= mc²(3√(5/3) -1)= mc²(√(15) -1)

Wait, that doesn't look like one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the options are  mc², 2mc², 3mc², 4mc².

Hmm, so either my approach is wrong or I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when substituting. Let me go back step by step.

From energy conservation:

E_photon + mc² = 3γ mc² => E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc².

From momentum:

E_photon = 3γ mv c => v = E_photon / (3γ mv c) ?? Wait, no:

Wait, E_photon = 3γ mv c => Solving for v: v = E_photon / (3γ m c).

E_photon is 3γ mc² - mc².

So,

v = (3γ mc² - mc²) / (3γ m c) = [c² (3γ -1)] / (3γ c) = c (3γ -1)/(3γ)

Which simplifies to v = c (1 - 1/(3γ))

That's correct.

Then, plug into γ:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - [ (3γ -1)/(3γ) ]² )

Let me compute 1 - [ (3γ -1)/(3γ) ]²:

Let me compute (3γ -1)/(3γ):

= 1 - 1/(3γ)

So squared:

(1 - 1/(3γ))² = 1 - 2/(3γ) + 1/(9γ²)

Therefore,

1 - [1 - 2/(3γ) + 1/(9γ²)] = 2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)

So,

sqrt(2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)) = 1/γ

So,

2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²) = 1/γ²

Multiply both sides by 9γ²:

6γ² -1 = 9

So,

6γ² =10 => γ²=10/6=5/3

Therefore, γ=√(5/3)

So, back to E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc².

Plug in γ=√(5/3):

E_photon= mc² (3√(5/3) -1) = mc² (√15 -1)

Hmm, so approximately √15≈3.872, so √15 -1≈2.872 mc². So, about 2.87 mc².

But the options are 1,2,3,4 mc². So, closest is 3 mc², but not exactly. That suggests that perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the particles are non-relativistic? Let me test that.

If I consider the kinetic energy as classical, KE = (1/2)mv².

So, energy conservation:

E_photon + mc² = 3*(1/2 mv²) + 3 mc²

Wait, no. Wait, each particle (two electrons and one positron) would have kinetic energy (1/2)mv², so total kinetic energy is (3/2)mv².

Plus their rest energy: 3 mc².

So,

E_photon + mc² = (3/2)mv² + 3mc²

Therefore, E_photon = (3/2 mv²) + 3mc² - mc² = (3/2 mv²) + 2mc²

From momentum, E_photon/c = 3mv (since each has momentum mv)

So, E_photon = 3mv c

Therefore,

3mv c = (3/2 mv²) + 2 mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3v c = (3/2 v²) + 2 c²

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction:

6v c = 3v² + 4 c²

Bring all terms to left:

3v² -6v c +4 c²=0

This is a quadratic in v:

3v² -6c v +4c²=0

Solve for v:

v = [6c ± sqrt(36c² - 48c²)] /6 = [6c ± sqrt(-12c²)] /6

Wait, discriminant is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, contradiction. So, non-relativistic assumption is invalid.

Therefore, we have to use relativistic energy.

But according to that, E_photon≈2.87 mc², which is close to 3 mc², but the exact value is sqrt(15) -1≈2.872 mc², which is approximately 2.87 mc².

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem is assuming something different?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the positron and the two electrons are all moving in the same direction, but with equal speeds, but maybe we need to consider their velocities differently?

Wait, is there another approach?

I remember that in pair production, the photon must have at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron because energy must be conserved. So, 2 mc².

Wait, but in this case, the photon is creating a positron and two electrons, so total rest mass is 3 mc², but since the photon is also providing the necessary energy, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the photon's energy is 2 mc².

Wait, maybe that's the way to think about it.

In the rest frame of the system (center of momentum frame), the total momentum is zero.

So, in that frame, the photon must have enough energy to create the rest mass of the particles.

Wait, but photons cannot be at rest, so perhaps in the center of momentum frame, the photon's energy is equal to the total rest mass energy.

But I need to formalize that.

Alternatively, let's think about the system after collision.

In the rest frame where the total momentum is zero, the photon must have energy equal to the rest mass energy of the produced particles.

Wait, that might not directly apply here because the photon is absorbed and then the particles move. But if we consider the invariant quantity, the square of the total four-momentum.

Wait, the invariant quantity is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, the four-momentum is (E_photon + mc², E_photon / c).

In the final state, the four-momentum is (3γ mc², 3γ m v).

So, invariance tells us that:

(E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 = (E_final)^2 - (p_final c)^2

So,

(E_photon + mc²)^2 - (E_photon)^2 = (3γ mc²)^2 - (3γ m v c)^2

Simplify the left side:

(E_photon + mc²)^2 - E_photon² = [E_photon² + 2 E_photon mc² + (mc²)^2] - E_photon² = 2 E_photon mc² + (mc²)^2

Right side:

(3γ mc²)^2 - (3γ m v c)^2 = 9γ² m² c^4 - 9γ² m² v² c² = 9γ² m² c² (c² - v²) = 9γ² m² c² ( (1 - v²/c²)c² ) = 9γ² m² c^4 (1 - v²/c² )

But from the energy relation, E_photon = 3γ mc² - mc²

So,

Left side: 2 E_photon mc² + (mc²)^2 = 2(3γ mc² - mc²) mc² + mc^4 = 2*3γ mc^4 - 2 mc^4 + mc^4 = 6γ mc^4 - mc^4

Right side: 9γ² m² c^4 (1 - v²/c² ) = 9γ² m² c^4 (1 - (v²/c² )) = 9γ² m² c^4 (1 - (1 - 1/γ² )) because 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ²

Wait, no, 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ², so:

Right side: 9γ² m² c^4 (1/γ² ) = 9 m² c^4.

Therefore, equating left and right:

6γ mc^4 - mc^4 = 9 m² c^4

Divide both sides by m c^4:

6γ -1 =9 m / m =9

Therefore,

6γ -1 =9

So,

6γ =10

γ=10/6=5/3≈1.666...

So, γ=5/3.

Thus, going back to E_photon =3γ mc² - mc² =3*(5/3) mc² - mc²=5 mc² - mc²=4 mc².

Wait, that's 4 mc². So, E_photon=4 mc².

But wait, that conflicts with previous calculation where I got sqrt(15)-1≈2.87 mc². That's confusing.

Wait, let me retrace.

Wait, in invariant equation:

(E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here about a photon striking an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The question is asking about the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc². It says the correct answer is B, 2mc², but I want to figure out why that is.

Let me start by recalling what I know about photons, electrons, and their interactions. A photon is a particle with no mass and travels at the speed of light, right? When a photon collides with an electron, which is initially at rest, it can transfer some of its energy to the electron. But in this case, instead of just transferring energy, the photon creates an electron-positron pair. So, the photon is destroyed in the process, and three particles move off: a positron and two electrons.

Hmm, so the initial setup is an electron at rest, and a photon comes in and hits it. After the collision, there are three particles moving in the same direction as the original photon. Since all three are moving at equal speeds, their kinetic energies must be equal. That makes sense because if they all have the same speed, their kinetic energies would be the same.

Now, I need to consider the conservation laws here. Since no external forces are acting on the system (assuming an isolated collision), both energy and momentum must be conserved.

Let me write down the conservation equations. The total energy before the collision is the energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the electron. The total momentum is just the momentum of the photon since the electron is at rest.

So, before collision:
- Total Energy (E₁) = Energy of photon (E_photon) + Rest energy of electron (mc²)
- Total Momentum (p₁) = Momentum of photon (p_photon) = E_photon / c, because for a photon, E = pc.

After collision:
- There are three particles: positron, electron, and electron.
- Each has the same speed, so their kinetic energies are equal.
- The rest energy of each electron is mc², and the positron also has a rest energy of mc².

Let me denote the kinetic energy of each particle as K. Since there are two electrons and a positron, the total kinetic energy after collision is 3K.

But wait, each particle has rest mass mc, so their total rest energy is 3mc². Therefore, the total energy after collision is 3mc² + 3K.

Since energy is conserved, E_after = E_before:
3mc² + 3K = mc² + E_photon

So, rearranging:
E_photon = 3mc² + 3K - mc² = 2mc² + 3K

Hmm, so E_photon is equal to 2mc² plus three times the kinetic energy of each particle. But I don't know K yet, so maybe I can find another equation using momentum conservation.

Total momentum before collision is p_photon = E_photon / c.

After collision, each particle has momentum p, so total momentum is 3p (since all three move in the same direction).

Therefore, momentum conservation:
3p = E_photon / c

But p for each particle is (gamma * m * v), where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is their velocity.

Since all three particles have the same speed v, their momenta are equal.

So, 3 * (gamma * m * v) = E_photon / c.

But I need to relate this to the kinetic energy K.

Recall that the kinetic energy K is related to the momentum p by:
K = (gamma - 1)mc²

And for a non-relativistic case, K = (1/2)mv², but since the particles might be moving at relativistic speeds, we need to use the full expression.

But this might get complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption here. If the kinetic energy is non-relativistic, then K ≈ (1/2)mv². But if it's relativistic, K = (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but I don't know if the particles are moving at relativistic speeds. The problem says they move off at equal speeds, so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a ratio or express E_photon in terms of the rest energies.

Let me see, from the energy equation:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3K

And from the momentum equation:

3p = E_photon / c

But also, each particle has momentum p = gamma mv.

So, let's express K in terms of p.

Since K = (gamma - 1)mc², and p = gamma mv

So, K = (gamma - 1)mc²

Therefore, E_photon = 2mc² + 3(gamma - 1)mc² = 2mc² + 3gamma mc² - 3mc² = (2 - 3)mc² + 3gamma mc² = (-mc²) + 3gamma mc² = 3gamma mc² - mc²

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can write gamma in terms of p.

We have p = gamma mv

So, gamma = p / (mv)

Similarly, K = (gamma - 1)mc² = (p / (mv) - 1)mc²

So, plugging back into E_photon:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3(p / (mv) - 1)mc²

Simplify:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3p/(mv) mc² - 3mc²

Which simplifies to:

E_photon = -mc² + 3p/(mv) mc²

Factor out mc²:

E_photon = mc²( -1 + 3p/(mv) )

But from the momentum equation, 3p = E_photon / c, so p = E_photon / (3c)

Plugging that into the equation above:

E_photon = mc²( -1 + 3*(E_photon / (3c)) / (mv) )

Simplify the expression inside:

= mc²( -1 + (E_photon / (c)) / (mv) )

= mc²( -1 + E_photon / (mcv) )

So, that gives:

E_photon = mc²( -1 + E_photon / (mcv) )

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me see:

E_photon = mc²( -1 + E_photon / (mcv) )

Divide both sides by mc²:

E_photon / mc² = -1 + E_photon / (mcv)

Let me denote E_photon = E, m = m_e, c = c, v = v

So:

E / mc² = -1 + E / (m_e c v )

So, E / mc² + 1 = E / (m_e c v )

Hmm, I can rearrange terms:

E / (m_e c v ) - E / mc² = 1

Factor out E/mc:

E/mc (1 / (c v ) - 1 / c² ) = 1

Wait, maybe factor differently.

Let me write it as:

E [ 1/(m_e c v) - 1/(m c²) ] = 1

Wait, E is the same on both sides.

Wait, maybe I need to express E in terms of v.

Wait, perhaps I can relate E_photon to the rest masses and the kinetic energies.

Alternatively, maybe this problem is designed such that the kinetic energy can be neglected or considered non-relativistic. Let me test that.

Assuming the particles move non-relativistically, so kinetic energy K = (1/2) m v².

Then, from energy conservation:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3*(1/2 mv²)

Momentum conservation:

3p = E_photon / c

And p = m v (since non-relativistic)

Thus, 3 m v = E_photon / c

So, E_photon = 3 m v c

But from energy conservation, E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2) m v²

So,

3 m v c = 2mc² + (3/2) m v²

Divide both sides by m:

3 v c = 2c² + (3/2) v²

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

6 v c = 4 c² + 3 v²

Rearrange:

3 v² - 6 v c + 4 c² = 0

This is a quadratic in v:

3 v² - 6 c v + 4 c² = 0

Let me solve for v:

v = [6c ± sqrt(36c² - 48c²)] / (2*3)

Simplify the discriminant:

sqrt(36c² - 48c²) = sqrt(-12c²) which is imaginary.

Uh-oh, that's a problem. That suggests that under the non-relativistic assumption, the equation has no real solution, meaning the assumption is invalid. Therefore, the particles must be moving at relativistic speeds.

So, I can't neglect the kinetic energy as non-relativistic. I need to use the full Lorentz factor.

So, going back to the previous equations:

E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

Wait, where did I get that? Let me check.

Earlier, I had:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3K

And K = (gamma - 1)mc²

So, E_photon = 2mc² + 3(gamma - 1)mc² = 2mc² + 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc² = (2 - 3)mc² + 3 gamma mc² = -mc² + 3 gamma mc²

So, E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc².

So that's equation one.

From momentum:

3 gamma m v = E_photon / c

So, 3 gamma m v = (3 gamma mc² - mc²)/c = 3 gamma m c - m c² / c = 3 gamma m c - m c

So, 3 gamma m v = 3 gamma m c - m c

Divide both sides by m:

3 gamma v = 3 gamma c - c

So,

3 gamma (v - c) = -c

Divide both sides by 3 gamma:

v - c = -c / (3 gamma)

So,

v = c - c / (3 gamma)

Hmm, interesting. So, velocity is less than c, as it should be.

Now, let's express gamma in terms of v.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

So, let's write v in terms of gamma:

v = c - c / (3 gamma) = c(1 - 1/(3 gamma))

So,

v = c(1 - 1/(3 gamma))

So,

v / c = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

Let me square both sides:

(v/c)² = [1 - 1/(3 gamma)]² = 1 - 2/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)

But from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), so let's square both sides:

gamma² = 1 / (1 - (v²/c²))

So,

1 - (v²/c²) = 1 / gamma²

Which gives:

v²/c² = 1 - 1 / gamma²

So,

(v/c)² = 1 - 1 / gamma²

But earlier, (v/c)² = 1 - 2/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)

Set equal:

1 - 2/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²) = 1 - 1 / gamma²

Simplify:

Subtract 1 from both sides:

-2/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²) = -1 / gamma²

Bring all terms to left side:

-2/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²) + 1 / gamma² = 0

Combine terms:

-2/(3 gamma) + (1 + 9)/(9 gamma²) = 0

Wait, 1/(9 gamma²) + 1 / gamma² = (1 + 9)/9 gamma² = 10/(9 gamma²)

So,

-2/(3 gamma) + 10/(9 gamma²) = 0

Multiply both sides by 9 gamma² to eliminate denominators:

-2 * 3 gamma + 10 = 0

Simplify:

-6 gamma + 10 = 0

So,

6 gamma = 10

gamma = 10 / 6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666...

So, gamma is 5/3.

Now, let's go back to E_photon.

We had E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

Plugging gamma = 5/3:

E_photon = 3*(5/3) mc² - mc² = 5 mc² - mc² = 4 mc²

Wait, that's not B. That's D. 4mc².

But the question says the correct answer is B. 2mc².

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Starting from E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

With gamma = 5/3

So, 3*(5/3) mc² = 5 mc²

Then 5 mc² - mc² = 4 mc²

So, E_photon = 4 mc²

But the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc²

So, according to my calculation, it's D.

But the question says the correct answer is B. So, I must have an error.

Wait, maybe my energy conservation was wrong.

Wait, going back.

The total energy after collision is the rest energy of the three particles plus their kinetic energies.

Each particle has rest energy mc² and kinetic energy K.

So, total energy after collision is 3mc² + 3K.

Total energy before collision is the photon's energy plus the electron's rest energy, which is E_photon + mc².

So, yes, E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + 3K

So, E_photon = 2mc² + 3K

Then, I used momentum.

Total momentum after collision is 3p, each p = gamma m v.

So, 3 gamma m v = E_photon / c

But then I also have:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3K, and K = (gamma -1)mc²

So, E_photon = 2mc² + 3(gamma -1) mc² = 2mc² + 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc² = - mc² + 3 gamma mc²

Wait, that's correct.

Then, from momentum:

3 gamma m v = E_photon / c

Divide both sides by m:

3 gamma v = E_photon / (mc)

But E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

So,

3 gamma v = (3 gamma mc² - mc²) / (mc)

Simplify RHS:

= 3 gamma c - c / m

Wait, wait that can't be. Because E_photon is in units of energy, so E_photon / (mc) would be (energy)/(mass * c). Hmm, actually, let's check units.

Wait, E_photon is energy, mc is mass times c. So, E_photon / (mc) has units of (energy)/(mass * c). But energy is mass * c², so E_photon / (mc) = (mass * c²) / (mass * c) ) = c.

So, 3 gamma v = c.

So, 3 gamma v = c

Hence, v = c / (3 gamma)

So, v = c / (3 gamma)

Earlier, I thought v = c - c / (3 gamma), but that was incorrect. It's actually v = c / (3 gamma)

So, that changes things.

So, v = c / (3 gamma)

Then, let's compute gamma.

From gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (c² / (9 gamma² c²)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 1 / (9 gamma²))

So,

gamma² = 1 / (1 - 1 / (9 gamma²))

Multiply numerator and denominator by 9 gamma²:

gamma² = 9 gamma² / (9 gamma² - 1)

So,

gamma² (9 gamma² - 1) = 9 gamma²

Divide both sides by gamma² (assuming gamma ≠ 0):

9 gamma² - 1 = 9

So,

9 gamma² = 10

gamma² = 10 / 9

gamma = sqrt(10)/3 ≈ 1.054

So, gamma is sqrt(10)/3.

Now, going back to E_photon:

E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

Wait, no, earlier I had:

E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

But actually, let's double-check.

From earlier:

E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

But let's see, that came from:

E_photon = 2mc² + 3(gamma -1)mc² = 2 mc² + 3 gamma mc² - 3 mc² = (2 - 3) mc² + 3 gamma mc² = - mc² + 3 gamma mc²

So, yes, E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc²

So, plugging gamma = sqrt(10)/3:

E_photon = 3*(sqrt(10)/3) mc² - mc² = sqrt(10) mc² - mc²

Which is approximately (3.16 - 1) mc² ≈ 2.16 mc²

But our options are 2 mc²
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've come across this physics problem, and I want to figure out why the correct answer is B, 2mc². Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem goes like this: A photon strikes an electron of mass m that's initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The question is asking about the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc². The correct answer is given as B, 2mc². Hmm, why is that?

Alright, let me start by recalling some basic concepts from particle physics and relativity. When a high-energy photon interacts with a matter particle, it can create an electron-positron pair. This process must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the electron is initially at rest, the photon must carry enough energy to create the rest mass energy of the two particles.

First, the rest mass energy of an electron is given by mc². Since we create two electrons (or rather, an electron and a positron), the total rest mass energy would be 2mc². But wait, the positron also has a rest mass energy of mc², so together, yes, 2mc². So, the photon must provide at least that amount of energy. But is that all?

Hold on, because the photon is also being destroyed in the process. So the energy of the photon is entirely converted into the rest mass energy of the produced particles, plus any kinetic energy they gain. But in this case, the problem states that the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, all three particles have the same kinetic energy. Since they have the same speed, their kinetic energies are the same.

Let me denote the speed of the particles as v, and the speed of the photon as c, which is much higher than v because photons travel at the speed of light. Before the collision, the photon's energy is entirely its rest mass energy, which is mc² (E_photon = pc, but since for a photon, E = pc, and the rest mass is zero, so E_photon = pc). Wait, no, actually, the rest mass of a photon is zero, so its energy is entirely kinetic. So, E_photon = pc.

After the collision, the photon is destroyed, so all its energy goes into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the particles. So, the total energy after the collision should equal the energy before the collision. That is, E_photon = (Rest energy of particles) + (Kinetic energy of particles).

The rest energy of the particles is 2mc² (since we have two electrons and a positron, all with rest mass m). The kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the three particles. Since they all move off at the same speed v, their kinetic energies are each (1/2)mv². So, the total kinetic energy is 3*(1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².

Thus, the total energy after the collision is 2mc² + (3/2)mv². But the energy before the collision was just E_photon. Therefore:

E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

So, if we could calculate v, we could find E_photon. But perhaps there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's consider conservation of momentum. Since the electron was initially at rest, the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the photon, which is E_photon/c (since for a photon, momentum p = E/c).

After the collision, the positron and two electrons are moving off with equal speeds v. So, their momenta are each (mv)/c, right? Because momentum p = mv/c for each particle.

So, the total momentum after the collision is 3*(mv)/c. Therefore, by conservation of momentum:

E_photon/c = 3*(mv)/c

Simplify both sides by multiplying by c:

E_photon = 3mv

Hmm, so from momentum conservation, E_photon is 3mv.

Now, let's go back to the energy conservation equation:

E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

But from momentum, E_photon = 3mv. So:

3mv = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Hmm, that's an equation we can try to solve for v. Let's rearrange:

3mv - (3/2)mv² = 2mc²

Factor out 3mv:

3mv(1 - (v/2)) = 2mc²

Divide both sides by 3m:

v(1 - v/2) = (2c²)/3

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation in terms of v. Let me write that as:

v - (v²)/2 = (2c²)/3

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:

2v - v² = (4c²)/3

Rearranged:

v² - 2v + (4c²)/3 = 0

Wait, actually, let's move everything to one side:

v - (v²)/2 - (2c²)/3 = 0

Multiply by 6 to eliminate denominators:

6v - 3v² - 4c² = 0

So, 3v² - 6v + 4c² = 0

Wait, no: 6v - 3v² - 4c² = 0 => -3v² +6v -4c²=0, multiply by -1: 3v² -6v +4c²=0

So, quadratic in v:

3v² -6v +4c² =0

Use quadratic formula:

v = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 48c²)]/(2*3) = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 48c²)]/6

Hmm, discriminant is 36 - 48c², which would be negative if c² is non-zero, which it is. So that suggests something is wrong because we can't have a negative discriminant in this context.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in setting up the equations.

Wait, let's go back. When considering energy and momentum conservation, perhaps I made a mistake in how I equated them.

Wait, no. Let me double-check:

From momentum: E_photon = 3mv

From energy: E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

So, setting them equal:

3mv = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Yes, that's correct.

Then, moving terms:

3mv - (3/2)mv² = 2mc²

Factor 3mv:

3mv(1 - v/2) = 2mc²

So,

v(1 - v/2) = (2c²)/3

Hmm, so the left side is v(1 - v/2). Let me let x = v, so:

x(1 - x/2) = (2c²)/3

So,

x - (x²)/2 = (2c²)/3

Multiply both sides by 2:

2x - x² = (4c²)/3

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

x² - 2x + (4c²)/3 = 0

Wait, no: it's 2x - x² - (4c²)/3 = 0 => -x² +2x - (4c²)/3=0 => x² -2x + (4c²)/3=0

Yes, so quadratic in x:

x² -2x + (4c²)/3=0

So, discriminant D = ( -2 )² - 4*1*(4c²/3) = 4 - (16c²)/3

Hmm, so discriminant is 4 - (16c²)/3. For real solutions, D must be ≥0:

4 - (16c²)/3 ≥0 => (16c²)/3 ≤4 => 16c² ≤12 => c² ≤12/16=3/4 => c² ≤0.75

But c² is 1 (in units where c=1), so 1 > 0.75, so discriminant is negative. That suggests no real solution for v, which is impossible because v must be a real number.

This must mean I messed up somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, is the assumption that all three particles (the two electrons and the positron) have the same speed correct? The problem says they move off at equal speeds. So, yes, same speed. So each has velocity v.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in energy conservation. Let me think about rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, the total rest mass after the collision is 2mc² (electron and positron each have mc²). Kinetic energy is (3/2)mv². So, energy before (photon) is energy after: E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv².

But the photon's energy is also E_photon = pc, and since the photon is destroyed, the momentum after is the sum of the momenta of the three particles. Each has momentum mv/c, so total momentum is 3mv/c. Therefore, E_photon/c = 3mv/c, hence E_photon = 3mv.

So, 3mv = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

So that's the same equation as before. So, same issue.

But since this leads to a quadratic with negative discriminant, that suggests that the assumption that all three particles have same speed is impossible? Or that the photon's energy cannot satisfy both energy and momentum conservation? That can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the conservation laws. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the kinetic energy is only (1/2)mv² for each particle, so three particles would have (3/2)mv². So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the photon's energy is related to its frequency or wavelength, but since it's a high-energy photon, frequency is high. But in the problem, the rest mass of the particles is 2mc².

Wait, another approach: Let me think in terms of invariant mass. The square of the total energy and momentum should be invariant.

Before collision: total energy is E_photon, total momentum is E_photon / c.

After collision: total energy is 2mc² + (3/2)mv², total momentum is 3mv/c.

So, the invariant is:

Before: (E_photon)^2 / c² - (E_photon)^2 / c² = 0. Wait, no.

Wait, the invariant is (total energy)^2 - (total momentum c)^2.

So, invariant squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

For the photon, E = pc, so (E)^2 - (pc)^2 = 0.

After collision, invariant squared is [2mc² + (3/2)mv²]^2 - [3mv]^2 c².

This should be equal to 0, since the same invariant applies.

So:

[2mc² + (3/2)mv²]^2 - [3mv c]^2 =0

Let me compute this:

First, expand [2mc² + (3/2)mv²]^2:

= (2mc²)^2 + 2*(2mc²)*(3/2 mv²) + (3/2 mv²)^2

= 4m²c⁴ + 6mc² mv² + (9/4)m²v⁴

Then, subtract [3mv c]^2:

= 9m²v²c²

So, entire expression:

4m²c⁴ + 6mc² mv² + (9/4)m²v⁴ -9m²v²c²=0

Let me factor m²:

m²[4c⁴ +6c²v² + (9/4)v⁴ -9v²c²]=0

Since m is not zero, we can divide both sides by m²:

4c⁴ +6c²v² + (9/4)v⁴ -9v²c²=0

Combine like terms:

4c⁴ + (6c²v² -9c²v²) + (9/4)v⁴=0

Which is:

4c⁴ -3c²v² + (9/4)v⁴=0

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators:

16c⁴ -12c²v² +9v⁴=0

Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of c². Let me set x = c²:

16x² -12x v² +9v⁴=0

So quadratic equation: 16x² -12x v² +9v⁴=0

Solve for x:

x = [12v² ± sqrt(144v⁴ - 4*16*9v⁴)]/(2*16)

Compute discriminant:

sqrt(144v⁴ - 576v⁴)=sqrt(-432v⁴)

Wait, that's imaginary again. That can't be right. Hmm.

So, same problem arises: the discriminant is negative, implying no real solution. That's impossible because we have a real physical scenario.

This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, which is that all three particles have the same speed v. Maybe that's not possible? Or maybe I need to approach this differently.

Wait, let me think about another approach. The problem says the photon is destroyed, creating an electron and a positron. But wait, the original question says it creates an electron-positron pair, so the products are an electron, a positron, and another electron? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, perhaps the initial electron is at rest, then the photon hits it and creates an electron-positron pair, so the initial electron is actually annihilated, and the photon's energy is split into the rest mass of an electron, a positron, and an additional energy? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, actually, no. When a photon interacts with an electron, it can cause the electron to emit an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron (mass m) is at rest, and after the collision, it becomes two electrons and a positron. But that's three particles: the original electron turns into two electrons and a positron? That doesn't make sense, because that would imply the original electron is somehow split into three particles. Wait, no, maybe it's the original electron (mass m) is scattered, and the photon creates an electron-positron pair. But then we have the original electron, plus an electron and a positron? So that's three particles in total: original electron, plus electron, plus positron. But then the original electron must have absorbed the photon's energy and emitted an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron is now moving with some kinetic energy, the emitted electron is moving, and the positron is moving. But the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. Hmm, so all three: the original electron, the emitted electron, and the positron, all moving at the same speed v.

But the original electron was initially at rest, so if all three are moving at the same speed v, then the original electron is now moving with speed v. So, maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the original electron is annihilated, but that doesn't make sense because we have the pair production. Wait, in pair production, a photon must interact with a nucleus or something, but in this case, the electron is at rest, so perhaps the process is a little different.

Wait, perhaps the original electron is just sitting there, and the photon creates an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron remains, but the photon is absorbed, and creates two more electrons and a positron? Wait, no, that would be three electrons and a positron, which seems odd.

Wait, perhaps the original electron is not present. Wait, the problem says a photon strikes an electron of mass m. So, the initial state is a photon and an electron at rest. After the collision, the photon is destroyed, and the products are an electron, a positron, and another electron. So, three particles: two electrons and a positron.

Wait, but that would imply that the original electron is somehow transformed into two electrons and a positron, which seems like a violation of conservation laws.

Wait, perhaps the original electron is still present, and the photon creates an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron is there, and we have two more electrons and a positron? No, that doesn't make sense because that would be three electrons and a positron. Hmm, I think I need to clarify.

Wait, let's look at the problem again: "A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon."

So, the initial state is a photon and an electron at rest. After the collision: the photon is gone, and we have a positron and two electrons moving off. So, the original electron must have been involved in the collision. Maybe the original electron is the one that is now moving with the positron and the other electron.

So, the products are three particles: two electrons and a positron, all moving at the same speed v. So, the original electron (mass m) is now split into three particles, each with mass m. That is, the original electron is somehow divided into two electrons and a positron, each with mass m.

Wait, that can't be, because then you have three particles each with mass m. That would imply that the total rest mass energy is 3mc², but in reality, the rest mass energy of the system is 2mc² (for two electrons and a positron). So, the original electron's rest mass is m, but after the collision, the system's rest mass is 2mc²? That seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is not conserved in this
[overthinking]
Okay, so I came across this physics problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

The problem says: A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The question is asking for the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc². The correct answer is given as B, 2mc². Hmm, I need to see why that is the case.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. When a photon interacts with an electron, it can transfer its energy to the electron, causing the electron to emit particles or change states. In this case, the photon is destroying itself by creating an electron-positron pair. So, the photon's energy is being used to create these two particles.

I remember from my studies that in such interactions, energy and momentum conservation must be satisfied. Also, the photon has no mass, so its energy is entirely electromagnetic, and it's always moving at the speed of light. The electron, on the other hand, has rest mass energy mc², and initially, it's at rest.

So, let's break it down. Let me denote:

- Photon energy: E_photon
- Electron rest energy: mc²
- Created particles: positron and two electrons, each with some kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, all three particles have the same speed. Let me denote the speed of each as v. Since they're moving along the initial direction of the photon, their momenta are in the same direction as the photon was traveling.

First, let's consider conservation of energy. The total energy before the collision is just the photon's energy, E_photon, because the electron is at rest, so its energy is just mc², but since the photon is about to interact, maybe its energy is what's being considered here.

Wait, no, the photon is striking the electron, so the total energy is the electron's rest energy plus the photon's energy. Hmm, no, wait. Before the interaction, the electron is at rest, so its energy is mc², and the photon has energy E_photon. So the total energy before is mc² + E_photon.

After the collision, we have two electrons and a positron. Each of them is moving with speed v, so their energies are each γmv², where γ is the Lorentz factor: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since they're moving at the same speed, all three have the same γ, so the total energy after is:

Total energy after = (γmv²) + (γmv²) + (γmv²) = 3γmv².

But wait, the positron also has a rest mass energy mc², same as the electron. So actually, each particle's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. So the total energy after the collision is:

Total energy after = (mc²) + (γmv² - mc²) + (mc²) + (γmv² - mc²) + (mc²) + (γmv² - mc²)

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think again.

Each electron and the positron will have their rest energy plus their kinetic energy. So, for each particle, energy is mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. Since all three have the same speed, their kinetic energies are the same. So the total energy after the collision is:

Total energy after = (mc² + K) + (mc² + K) + (mc² + K) = 3mc² + 3K.

But the total energy before the collision is the sum of the electron's rest energy and the photon's energy, which is mc² + E_photon.

So, setting energy conservation:

mc² + E_photon = 3mc² + 3K.

So, E_photon = 2mc² + 3K. (1)

Okay, that's one equation. Now, let's consider momentum conservation.

Before the collision, the photon is moving with momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, since for a photon, E = pc.

The electron is initially at rest, so its momentum is zero. So total initial momentum is E_photon / c.

After the collision, we have three particles moving off with speed v in the same direction. The momentum of each particle is γmv.

So, total momentum after is 3 * γmv.

Thus, momentum conservation gives:

E_photon / c = 3γmv. (2)

So, from equation (1):

E_photon = 2mc² + 3K.

From equation (2):

E_photon = 3c γmv.

So, putting equation (2) into equation (1):

3c γmv = 2mc² + 3K.

But K is the kinetic energy of each particle, which is (γ - 1)mc².

Because for a particle, kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc².

So, K = (γ - 1)mc².

Therefore, substituting into the previous equation:

3c γmv = 2mc² + 3(γ - 1)mc².

Let me write that out:

3c γmv = 2mc² + 3γmc² - 3mc².

Simplify the right-hand side:

2mc² - 3mc² + 3γmc² = (-mc²) + 3γmc² = mc²(3γ - 1).

So, equation becomes:

3c γmv = mc²(3γ - 1).

Let me solve for v in terms of γ or something.

But first, let's write it as:

3c γmv = mc²(3γ - 1).

Divide both sides by mc:

3c γ (v/m) = c²(3γ - 1).

Wait, maybe it's better to express γ in terms of v.

We know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Also, equation (2): E_photon = 3c γmv.

But E_photon is also equal to 3c γmv, so that's consistent.

Wait, perhaps if I express v in terms of γ.

From γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ², so v = c sqrt(1 - 1 / γ²).

Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me solve the equation we have:

3c γmv = mc²(3γ - 1).

Divide both sides by c:

3γmv = mc(3γ - 1).

Then, divide both sides by m:

3c γv = c(3γ - 1).

Wait, we have a c on both sides, so we can divide both sides by c:

3γv = 3γ - 1.

So, 3γv = 3γ - 1.

Let me write that as:

3γv - 3γ = -1

Factor out 3γ:

3γ(v - 1) = -1

So,

γ(v - 1) = -1/3

Hmm, that's an equation involving γ and v.

Also, we have from earlier:

From equation (2): E_photon = 3c γmv.

And from equation (1): E_photon = 2mc² + 3K = 2mc² + 3(γ - 1)mc² = 2mc² + 3γmc² - 3mc² = (3γ - 1)mc².

So, E_photon = (3γ - 1)mc².

But from equation (2), E_photon = 3c γmv.

So,

3c γmv = (3γ - 1)mc².

Which is the same equation we had before. So, now, we have:

3c γmv = (3γ - 1)mc²

Again, divide both sides by mc:

3c γ (v/m) = c²(3γ - 1)

Wait, perhaps I can write v = (c²(3γ - 1)) / (3c γm)

Simplify:

v = [c(3γ - 1)] / (3γm)

Hmm, okay, so now we have v expressed in terms of γ.

Also, recall that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, let me write γ in terms of v:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, substitute v from above into this equation.

Wait, this seems a bit involved, but let me proceed.

So, let me denote that v = [c(3γ - 1)] / (3γm)

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ

Thus,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / γ²

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1 / γ²

So, let's compute v²/c²:

v²/c² = [c²(3γ - 1)²] / (9γ²m²) / c²

Wait, actually, v is [c(3γ - 1)] / (3γm), so v² is [c²(3γ - 1)²] / (9γ²m²). Then, v²/c² is (3γ -1)² / (9γ²m²) * c² / c²? Wait, no.

Wait, sorry, let me recast it.

v = [c(3γ - 1)] / (3γm)

So, v² = [c²(3γ -1)^2] / (9γ²m²)

Then, v² / c² = (3γ -1)^2 / (9γ²m²) * c² / c²? Wait, no, v²/c² is just ([c(3γ -1)] / (3γm))² / c².

Which is [c²(3γ -1)^2] / (9γ²m²) / c² = (3γ -1)^2 / (9γ²m²)

So, from earlier,

v²/c² = 1 - 1 / γ²

So,

(3γ -1)^2 / (9γ²m²) = 1 - 1 / γ²

So, let me write that equation:

(3γ -1)^2 / (9γ²m²) = 1 - 1 / γ².

Hmm, that looks complicated, but let's try to solve for γ.

Multiply both sides by 9γ²m²:

(3γ -1)^2 = 9γ²m²(1 - 1 / γ²)

Simplify the right-hand side:

9γ²m²(1 - 1 / γ²) = 9γ²m² - 9m²

So,

(3γ -1)^2 = 9γ²m² - 9m²

Let me expand the left-hand side:

(3γ -1)^2 = 9γ² - 6γ + 1

So,

9γ² - 6γ + 1 = 9γ²m² - 9m²

Bring all terms to one side:

9γ² - 6γ + 1 - 9γ²m² + 9m² = 0

Hmm, this is getting messy. Let me factor common terms.

First, notice that the equation is:

9γ² - 6γ + 1 = 9m² γ² - 9m²

Let me rearrange:

9γ² - 9m² γ² -6γ + 1 + 9m² = 0

Factor out 9γ²:

9γ²(1 - m²) -6γ + (1 + 9m²) = 0

This seems complicated because of the m² term. Maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, let me think again about the setup.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says the photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, the three particles have the same speed. Hmm, but wait, the positron, electron, and another electron? So, is it two electrons and a positron all moving at the same speed? That might complicate things because the positron has the same mass as the electron, so their kinetic energies would be the same if they have the same speed.

But perhaps the energy and momentum can be handled in a way that considers the total.

Wait, another approach. Since the positron and electrons are moving at the same speed, their momenta are same, so the total momentum is 3 times the momentum of one particle.

Similarly, their kinetic energies are same, so the total kinetic energy is 3 times the kinetic energy of one.

So, perhaps I can write the total momentum as 3γmv and the total energy as 3(γmv² + mc²). Wait, but kinetic energy is (γ -1)mc².

So, total energy is 3( (γ -1)mc² + mc² ) = 3(γmc²). Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. For each particle, energy is mc² + K, where K = (γ -1)mc². So, each particle's energy is mc² + (γ -1)mc² = γmc². So, total energy is 3γmc².

But the initial total energy is mc² (rest energy of electron) + E_photon.

So, 3γmc² = mc² + E_photon.

Therefore, E_photon = 3γmc² - mc² = mc²(3γ -1).

Okay, that's the same as equation (1).

And total momentum is 3γmv.

But since the photon's momentum is E_photon / c, we have 3γmv = E_photon / c.

So, 3γmv = (mc²(3γ -1))/c.

Simplify:

3γmv = (3γ -1)mc² / c.

Divide both sides by m:

3γv = (3γ -1)c² / c.

So, 3γv = (3γ -1)c.

Then, solving for v:

v = [ (3γ -1)c ] / (3γ)

So, v = c(3γ -1)/(3γ) = c(1 - 1/(3γ)).

Wait, because (3γ -1)/(3γ) = 1 - 1/(3γ).

So, v = c(1 - 1/(3γ)).

Now, since v is less than c, which is fine.

Also, since γ is greater than 1, because particles are moving at speed v, so v ≠ 0.

Now, let's use the relation between v and γ.

We have γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's plug in v from above:

v = c(1 - 1/(3γ))

So, v = c - c/(3γ)

Thus, v² = [c - c/(3γ)]² = c²(1 - 2/(3γ) + 1/(9γ²))

So, v²/c² = 1 - 2/(3γ) + 1/(9γ²)

Therefore, 1 - v²/c² = 2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)).

But wait, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / γ.

Therefore,

1 / γ = sqrt(2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²))

Let me square both sides:

1 / γ² = 2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)

Multiply both sides by 9γ² to eliminate denominators:

9γ² * (1 / γ²) = 9γ² * [2/(3γ) - 1/(9γ²)]

Simplify left side:

9 = 9γ²*(2/(3γ)) - 9γ²*(1/(9γ²))

Simplify the right side:

First term: 9γ²*(2/(3γ)) = 9γ² * 2 / (3γ) = (9/3)*(2γ) = 3*(2γ) = 6γ

Second term: 9γ²*(1/(9γ²)) = 1

So, right side becomes 6γ - 1.

Therefore, equation is:

9 = 6γ - 1

So, 6γ = 10

γ = 10/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666...

Okay, so γ is 5/3. So, now we can find v.

From earlier, v = c(1 - 1/(3γ)).

So, plug γ = 5/3:

v = c(1 - 1/(3*(5/3))) = c(1 - 1/5) = c*(4/5) = (4/5)c.

So, v = 0.8c.

Now, having γ = 5/3, we can find E_photon.

From equation (1):

E_photon = mc²(3γ -1) = mc²(3*(5/3) -1) = mc²(5 -1) = 4mc².

Wait, but this contradicts the given correct answer of 2mc².

Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let's go back step by step.

We had:

Total energy after: 3γmc²

Total initial energy: mc² + E_photon

Therefore, E_photon = 3γmc² - mc² = mc²(3γ -1)

From momentum, we had:

E_photon = 3cγmv

And we related v to γ, leading
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a photon striking an electron and creating an electron-positron pair. I need to figure out why the correct answer is 2mc². Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says a photon with some energy hits an electron initially at rest. The photon is destroyed, and a positron and two electrons are created, all moving off in the same direction as the original photon. The question is about determining the energy of the photon, and the options are given from A to D.

Alright, so I remember that in particle physics, when a high-energy photon collides with a matter particle like an electron, it can create new particles. In this case, it's creating two electrons and a positron. Wait, actually, hold on. The question says an electron-positron pair, so that's two particles: one electron and one positron. But it says "the positron and two electrons," which is a bit confusing. So, does that mean in total we have three particles: the original electron, the positron, and another electron? Or is it two electrons and a positron?

Hmm, the wording is: "the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon." Hmm, so perhaps initially, there's one electron (the target), and then a photon strikes it, causing it to emit a positron and another electron. So in total, three particles: the original electron turns into two electrons and a positron? That seems a bit odd because charge would have to be conserved. Let me think about that.

The original electron has a charge of -e. The photon is neutral. So, after the collision, we have two electrons (each with charge -e) and a positron (with charge +e). So total charge would be (-e) + (-e) + (+e) = -e. Wait, that's just the same as before. So the original electron was at rest, and the photon had some energy. So, the total charge is conserved: one negative charge before, and two negatives and one positive after. So the net charge is -e, same as before.

But then, how about the energy? The photon is being destroyed, and energy is being converted into the kinetic energy of the three particles and their rest mass energies. So, the initial energy of the photon is converted into the kinetic energies of the two electrons and the positron, plus their rest mass energies.

Wait, but the rest mass energies of the particles: the original electron is at rest, so its rest energy is mc². The positron also has a rest mass energy of mc². The other electron also has mc². So in total, the rest energy would be 3mc². But since the original electron was at rest, maybe that's already included in the initial energy?

Wait, no, the initial energy is just the photon's energy, right? So the photon's energy is converted into the rest mass energies of the produced particles plus their kinetic energies.

But in the problem statement, it's said that the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. So, they all have the same speed. That might mean that we can consider their kinetic energies as equal, so each would have the same kinetic energy.

But let's get back to the conservation laws. We need to apply the conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the photon is initially moving in a certain direction, and the electron is at rest, the collision must conserve both energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial photon's energy as E. The initial momentum is just E/c in the direction of the photon, since the electron is at rest and has no momentum.

After the collision, we have three particles: two electrons and a positron, each moving with the same speed v. So, their momenta are all equal in magnitude, but their directions are the same as the initial photon. So, each particle has momentum p = gamma * m * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So, since all three particles are moving in the same direction, their momenta add up. Let's denote p as the magnitude of each momentum. So total momentum after collision is 3p = 3gamma m v.

The initial momentum was E/c. So, 3gamma m v = E/c. Let's note that equation as equation (1).

Now, for the energy conservation. The initial energy is just the photon's energy, E. The final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the particles plus their kinetic energies.

Each particle (two electrons and one positron) has rest mass energy mc². So, three particles: 3mc².

Their kinetic energies are (gamma - 1)mc² each. So, total kinetic energy is 3(gamma - 1)mc².

So, the total energy after collision is 3mc² + 3(gamma - 1)mc² = 3gamma mc².

Since energy is conserved, E = 3gamma mc². Let's note that as equation (2).

So, from equation (1): 3gamma m v = E/c

From equation (2): E = 3gamma mc²

So, substitute E from equation (2) into equation (1):

3gamma m v = (3gamma mc²)/c

Simplify right-hand side: (3gamma mc²)/c = 3gamma mc

So left-hand side: 3gamma m v

Therefore, 3gamma m v = 3gamma m c

Divide both sides by 3gamma m (assuming gamma ≠ 0 and m ≠ 0):

v = c

So, each particle is moving at speed of light? Wait, that can't be, because relativistic speeds are only approaching c, not equal to c. Hmm, that might suggest an issue with our assumption.

Wait, but in reality, when a photon collides with an electron, it can create a pair, but the speed of the produced particles can't actually reach c because that's a limit. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me go back. So, in equation (1): 3p = E/c, where p is the momentum of each particle, which is gamma m v.

In equation (2): E = 3gamma mc².

So, substituting equation (2) into (1):

3 gamma m v = (3 gamma mc²)/c

Simplify the right-hand side: 3 gamma mc² / c = 3 gamma m c

So:

3 gamma m v = 3 gamma m c

Divide both sides by 3 gamma m:

v = c

So, according to this, each particle is moving at speed c, but that's impossible because particles cannot reach c. So, perhaps this suggests that our initial assumption is wrong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that all three particles are moving at the same speed is leading to a contradiction, because when the speed approaches c, gamma becomes very large, which in turn causes the energy to be much higher. But maybe that's just the way it is in this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, let's think again. The original electron is at rest. So, its energy is just its rest energy, mc². The photon brings in energy E, so after the collision, the total energy is the photon's energy plus the original electron's rest energy? Wait, no.

Wait, the original electron is at rest, so its energy is mc². The photon has energy E. When the photon hits the electron, the total energy after collision is E + mc², but that energy is now distributed among the three particles.

So, the total energy after collision is E + mc² = 3 gamma mc².

Because each particle has energy gamma mc², and there are three particles: 3 gamma mc².

Similarly, the total momentum after collision is equal to the initial momentum.

The initial momentum is E / c, because the photon's momentum is E / c.

After collision, the momentum is 3 gamma m v, as each particle has momentum gamma m v, and they're all moving in the same direction.

So, equating the momenta:

3 gamma m v = E / c

And equating the energies:

E + mc² = 3 gamma mc²

So, from the energy equation:

E = 3 gamma mc² - mc² = mc²(3 gamma - 1)

From the momentum equation:

E = 3 gamma m v c

So, set equal:

mc²(3 gamma - 1) = 3 gamma m v c

Cancel m c from both sides:

(3 gamma - 1) = 3 gamma v

So, 3 gamma - 1 = 3 gamma v

So, solving for v:

v = (3 gamma - 1)/(3 gamma) = 1 - (1)/(3 gamma)

Hmm, so v is less than c because 1/(3 gamma) is positive, so v is 1 minus a positive number, so v < 1.

That makes sense because particles can't reach c.

So, now we have expressions for E in terms of gamma.

But how do we relate gamma and v?

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))

But v = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

So, let me write:

v = 1 - (1)/(3 gamma)

So, let's plug this into the expression for gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But v is 1 - 1/(3 gamma), so:

v = 1 - (1)/(3 gamma)

So, let's compute v²:

v² = [1 - (1)/(3 gamma)]² = 1 - (2)/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - [1 - (2)/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)]/c²

Wait, no, actually, let's compute 1 - v²/c²:

1 - v²/c² = 1 - [1 - (2)/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)] / c²

But wait, that seems messy. Maybe a different approach.

Let me express v in terms of gamma:

v = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

So, 1 - v = 1/(3 gamma)

Thus, 1/(3 gamma) = 1 - v

But from the energy equation, we had:

(3 gamma - 1) = 3 gamma v

Which we rearranged to get v = (3 gamma - 1)/(3 gamma) = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

So, same as above.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the relation between gamma and v.

We have:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Wait, no, actually:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma²

Thus, v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma²

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

But from earlier, we have v = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

So, setting them equal:

c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 1 - 1/(3 gamma)

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So, square both sides:

c² (1 - 1/gamma²) = [1 - 1/(3 gamma)]²

Expand the right-hand side:

[1 - 1/(3 gamma)]² = 1 - (2)/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)

So, left-hand side: c² (1 - 1/gamma²) = c² - c² / gamma²

So, equation becomes:

c² - c² / gamma² = 1 - (2)/(3 gamma) + 1/(9 gamma²)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

c² - c² / gamma² - 1 + (2)/(3 gamma) - 1/(9 gamma²) = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe it's better to make a substitution.

Let me denote x = 1/gamma. Then, gamma = 1/x, and since gamma > 1, x < 1.

So, substitute:

Left-hand side: c² - c² x² - 1 + (2)/(3) x - (1)/(9) x² = 0

So:

(c² - 1) - c² x² + (2)/(3) x - (1)/(9) x² = 0

Combine like terms:

(c² - 1) + (- c² - 1/9) x² + (2)/(3) x = 0

Let me write this as:

(- c² - 1/9) x² + (2/3) x + (c² - 1) = 0

Multiply all terms by -9 to eliminate denominators:

(c² + 1/9) * 9 x² - (2/3)*9 x - 9(c² - 1) = 0

Wait, no, let me think. Wait, actually, it's:

[ -c² - 1/9 ] x² + (2/3) x + (c² - 1) = 0

Let me factor out the negative sign from the first term:

- (c² + 1/9) x² + (2/3) x + (c² - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

(c² + 1/9) x² - (2/3) x - (c² - 1) = 0

So:

(c² + 1/9) x² - (2/3) x - (c² - 1) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me write it as:

A x² + B x + C = 0

Where:

A = c² + 1/9

B = -2/3

C = -(c² - 1) = -c² + 1

So, using quadratic formula:

x = [ -B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC) ] / (2A)

Plugging in:

x = [ 2/3 ± sqrt( ( -2/3 )² - 4*(c² + 1/9)*(-c² + 1) ) ] / (2*(c² + 1/9))

Compute discriminant D:

D = (4/9) - 4*(c² + 1/9)*(-c² + 1)

Compute the second term:

4*(c² + 1/9)*(-c² + 1) = 4*[ -c^4 + c² - (c²)/9 + 1/9 ]

= 4*[ -c^4 + (8/9)c² + 1/9 ]

= -4c^4 + (32/9)c² + 4/9

So, discriminant D:

D = 4/9 - (-4c^4 + 32/9 c² + 4/9)

= 4/9 + 4c^4 - 32/9 c² - 4/9

= 4c^4 - (32/9)c²

So,

D = 4c^4 - (32/9)c²

Factor out 4c²:

D = 4c²(c² - 8/9)

So,

sqrt(D) = sqrt(4c²(c² - 8/9)) = 2c sqrt(c² - 8/9)

But for sqrt to be real, c² - 8/9 >= 0

Which implies c² >= 8/9, which is true because c is the speed of light, so c² is much larger than 1.

So, now, back to x:

x = [ 2/3 ± 2c sqrt(c² - 8/9) ] / [ 2(c² + 1/9) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor out 2 in numerator:

x = [ 2(1/3 ± c sqrt(c² - 8/9)) ] / [ 2(c² + 1/9) ]

Cancel 2:

x = [ 1/3 ± c sqrt(c² - 8/9) ] / (c² + 1/9)

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I wonder if there's a better way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for gamma, I should think about the rest frame of the electron. Since the electron was initially at rest, maybe we can use the center-of-momentum frame or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared is equal to (E_total/c)^2 - (p_total)^2.

In the initial state, E_initial = E_photon + m c², since the electron is at rest. The momentum is E_photon / c.

In the final state, E_final = 3 gamma m c², and p_final = 3 gamma m v.

So, the invariant mass squared before and after should be equal.

So, invariant mass squared before collision:

(E_initial)^2 / c^2 - (p_initial)^2 = (E_photon + m c²)^2 / c² - (E_photon / c)^2

Similarly, invariant mass squared after collision:

(E_final)^2 / c² - (p_final)^2 = (3 gamma m c²)^2 / c² - (3 gamma m v)^2

So, set them equal:

(E_photon + m c²)^2 / c² - (E_photon / c)^2 = (3 gamma m c²)^2 / c² - (3 gamma m v)^2

Simplify left side:

[ (E_photon + m c²)^2 - E_photon^2 ] / c²

= [ E_photon^2 + 2 E_photon m c² + (m c²)^2 - E_photon^2 ] / c²

= [ 2 E_photon m c² + (m c²)^2
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a photon colliding with an electron, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is 2mc². Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that a photon strikes an electron of mass m that's initially at rest. This causes the electron to emit a positron and another electron. The photon is destroyed, and all three particles—the positron and the two electrons—move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The question is asking about the energy of the photon, with options A to D given as mc², 2mc², 3mc², and 4mc². The correct answer is supposedly B, 2mc². I need to understand why.

Alright, let's start by recalling some basic concepts from relativity. A photon has energy given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and λ is the wavelength. But when it interacts with matter, like an electron, the energy is also related to the rest mass energy of the electron. The rest mass energy of an electron is mc², which is about 0.511 MeV. Since the electron is initially at rest, the photon must provide enough energy to create the positron and the additional electron.

Wait, but creating a pair of electrons (or a positron and an electron) requires energy. Specifically, the threshold energy for pair production is 2mc² because you're creating two particles of mass m each. Is that right? Let me think. If you have a single electron, you need to create a positron and another electron, so that's two masses. So the minimum energy required should be 2mc². But is that the case here?

Hold on, the problem says that the photon is destroyed, which means it's completely absorbed. So the energy of the photon must be converted into the rest mass energy of the produced particles plus their kinetic energy. Initially, the electron is at rest, so it has energy mc². When the photon hits it, the total energy before the collision is the energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the electron. Then, after the collision, we have three particles: a positron and two electrons, all moving off with equal speeds.

Let me write down the conservation laws that apply here. We have conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. But since the photon is being destroyed, its energy is transferred into the kinetic energy of the particles and their rest masses.

So, the initial energy is the energy of the photon, let's call it E_photon, plus the rest energy of the electron, which is mc². The final energy is the rest energy of the positron (mc²) plus the rest energy of the two electrons (each mc², so 2mc²) plus the kinetic energy of all three particles. Since the positron and two electrons are moving off at equal speeds, their kinetic energies are the same. Let me denote the speed as v.

So, energy conservation gives:

E_photon + mc² = mc² + 2mc² + (1/2)mv² + (1/2)mv² + (1/2)mv²

Simplifying the right side: mc² is for the positron, and 2mc² is for the two electrons. Then, each has kinetic energy (1/2)mv², so three times (1/2)mv².

So:

E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + (3/2)mv²

Therefore, E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv².

But wait, the question is asking about the energy of the photon. So, E_photon is equal to 2mc² plus the kinetic energy of the three particles. Hmm, but why is the correct answer 2mc² then? Because if we consider that the photon's energy is the total energy minus the rest mass, but no, the rest mass is already included in the final energies.

Alternatively, maybe we need to use the concept of invariant mass or consider the center-of-momentum frame. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the total momentum as well. Initially, the photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, since for photons, momentum is E/c. The electron is initially at rest, so the total initial momentum is p_photon. After the collision, we have three particles moving off at the same speed v along the photon's direction. So their momenta are each p = (1/2)mv for each particle? Wait, no. The momentum of each particle is mass times velocity. Since they are moving along the same direction, their momenta add up.

So, the total momentum after the collision is 3*(mv) in the same direction as the photon. Therefore, momentum conservation gives:

p_photon = 3mv

But p_photon is also E_photon / c. So, E_photon / c = 3mv

Thus, E_photon = 3mv c

But from energy conservation, E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

So, substituting E_photon from the momentum equation into the energy equation:

3mv c = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Let me divide both sides by m to simplify:

3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Hmm, let's rearrange terms:

(3/2)v² - 3v c + 2c² = 0

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3v² - 6v c + 4c² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of v:

3v² - 6c v + 4c² = 0

Let me solve for v:

Using quadratic formula, v = [6c ± sqrt((6c)^2 - 4*3*4c²)] / (2*3)

Compute discriminant:

(6c)^2 - 4*3*4c² = 36c² - 48c² = -12c²

Uh-oh, negative discriminant, which would give complex roots. That can't be. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check my earlier steps.

I had E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv² from energy conservation.

From momentum, E_photon = 3mv c.

So, 3mv c = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Divided by m:

3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Then rearranged to:

(3/2)v² - 3v c + 2c² = 0

Wait, actually, bringing the 3vc to the right side:

(3/2)v² = 3v c - 2c²

Multiply by 2:

3v² = 6v c - 4c²

Bring all terms to left:

3v² - 6v c + 4c² = 0

Yes, same as before. The quadratic equation in v is giving a negative discriminant.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equations.

Let me go back.

After the collision, the positron and two electrons move off with equal speeds. So, their kinetic energies are each (1/2)mv², so total kinetic energy is 3*(1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².

But also, the rest energy is mc² for positron and 2mc² for electrons, so total rest energy is 3mc².

Hence, total energy after collision is 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

The initial energy is E_photon (energy of photon) plus the rest energy of the electron, which is mc².

So:

E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + (3/2)mv²

Thus:

E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

And from momentum, the photon's momentum is E_photon / c, which is equal to 3mv.

Therefore:

E_photon = 3mv c

So, setting equal:

3mv c = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Divide both sides by m:

3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, so 3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Let me write this as:

(3/2)v² - 3v c + 2c² = 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

3v² - 6v c + 4c² = 0

Which is the same quadratic.

But discriminant D = (6c)^2 - 4*3*4c² = 36c² - 48c² = -12c²

Negative discriminant, which suggests no real solution for v. That can't be right because the particles are moving off at some real speed.

So, maybe my mistake is in the assumption of the total kinetic energy or the rest energy?

Wait, maybe the rest energy isn't being considered correctly. The positron has rest mass energy mc², but is it the same as the electron? Yes, because positron has same mass as electron.

So, positron: mc², two electrons: 2mc². So total rest energy is 3mc².

Kinetic energy: (1/2)mv² each, so 3*(1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².

So, the total energy after collision is 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

Energy before collision: E_photon + mc².

Therefore, E_photon + mc² = 3mc² + (3/2)mv²

So, E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Momentum before collision: E_photon / c

Momentum after collision: 3mv

Therefore, E_photon / c = 3mv

So, E_photon = 3mv c

So, 3mv c = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Divided by m:

3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Which brings me back to the equation with negative discriminant.

Wait, this suggests that the quadratic equation has no real solution, which is impossible because particles do move off at some speed.

Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Instead of using conservation of energy and momentum, perhaps consider the invariant quantity, the square of the total energy-momentum vector.

In relativity, the invariant quantity is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = constant.

In the center-of-momentum frame, this would be the square of the total rest mass energy.

Let me compute the invariant before and after the collision.

Before the collision: the photon and the electron.

Total energy E_initial = E_photon + mc²

Total momentum p_initial = E_photon / c (since the electron is at rest, its momentum is zero)

So, the invariant is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 = (E_photon + mc²)^2 - (E_photon)^2

Compute this:

(E_photon + mc²)^2 - E_photon^2 = (E_photon^2 + 2 E_photon mc² + m²c^4) - E_photon^2 = 2 E_photon mc² + m²c^4

After the collision: three particles, all moving at speed v.

Total energy E_final = 3mc² + (3/2)mv²

Total momentum p_final = 3mv

So, the invariant is (E_final)^2 - (p_final c)^2

Compute this:

(3mc² + (3/2)mv²)^2 - (3mv c)^2

Let me expand the first term:

= [3mc²]^2 + 2*(3mc²)*(3/2 mv²) + (3/2 mv²)^2 - (3mv c)^2

Compute each part:

First term: 9m²c^4

Second term: 2*(3mc²)*(3/2 mv²) = 2*(9/2 m²c²v²) = 9 m²c²v²

Third term: (9/4)m²v^4

Fourth term: (9m²v²c²)

So, combining all terms:

9m²c^4 + 9m²c²v² + (9/4)m²v^4 - 9m²v²c²

Simplify:

9m²c^4 + (9m²c²v² - 9m²c²v²) + (9/4)m²v^4

The middle terms cancel out, so we have:

9m²c^4 + (9/4)m²v^4

So, the invariant after collision is 9m²c^4 + (9/4)m²v^4

Set this equal to the invariant before collision, which was 2 E_photon mc² + m²c^4

So:

9m²c^4 + (9/4)m²v^4 = 2 E_photon mc² + m²c^4

Simplify:

(9m²c^4 - m²c^4) + (9/4)m²v^4 = 2 E_photon mc²

So:

8m²c^4 + (9/4)m²v^4 = 2 E_photon mc²

Divide both sides by m²:

8c^4 + (9/4)v^4 = 2 E_photon c²

Rearrange:

2 E_photon c² = 8c^4 + (9/4)v^4

Divide both sides by 2:

E_photon c² = 4c^4 + (9/8)v^4

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I need to express v in terms of c.

Wait, let me see if I can find a relationship between v and c.

From earlier, from momentum:

E_photon = 3mv c

And from energy:

E_photon = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

So, 3mv c = 2mc² + (3/2)mv²

Divide both sides by m:

3v c = 2c² + (3/2)v²

Let me rearrange:

(3/2)v² - 3v c + 2c² = 0

Multiply by 2:

3v² - 6v c + 4c² = 0

Which is the same quadratic as before. Hmm, same discriminant:

D = ( -6c )² - 4*3*4c² = 36c² - 48c² = -12c²

Still negative. Hmm, that suggests no real solution, which can't be. So, I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe I should consider that the photon's energy is just enough to create the pair, ignoring the kinetic energy? But that seems incorrect because the problem mentions that the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds, implying they have kinetic energy.

Wait, but perhaps the rest mass energy of the initial electron is already part of the invariant, so maybe the photon's energy is just the difference?

Alternatively, think of it as the photon providing the necessary energy to create the pair. So, the energy required is 2mc². Therefore, the photon must have that energy. Maybe the rest of the energy goes into kinetic energy, but that would violate conservation of momentum.

Wait, but the initial system (photon and electron) is at rest? No, the electron is at rest, and the photon is moving, so the system isn't at rest. So, perhaps the center-of-momentum frame is different.

Wait, maybe let's think in the rest frame of the electron.

In the electron's rest frame, the photon comes in with some energy and momentum. The electron is at rest, so the total initial momentum is that of the photon. When the collision happens, the photon is absorbed, and three particles are produced, moving in the same direction.

But in the electron's rest frame, the photon's energy must be equal to the total rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the produced particles.

Wait, but in the rest frame of the electron, the photon has some energy E'. Let me calculate that.

In the electron's rest frame, the photon's energy E' must satisfy the threshold condition for pair production.

Wait, but pair production usually requires that the photon's energy in the rest frame of the electron is at least 2mc². Because, in that frame, the electron is at rest, and to create a positron and electron, the photon must supply at least 2mc².

So, if the photon has energy E' >= 2mc² in the electron's rest frame, pair production is possible.

But after the collision, three particles move off at equal speeds. So, the total momentum in the electron's rest frame must be equal to 3mv, since they all move in the same direction.

But the initial momentum in the electron's rest frame is E' / c (since the photon has momentum E' / c in this frame).

Therefore, E' / c = 3mv

Thus, E' = 3mv c

But in the rest frame of the electron, the energy of the photon is E' = E_photon + mc²?

Wait, no. In the rest frame of the electron, the total energy is E_photon + mc², but since the electron is at rest, the energy of the photon is E'. The total energy is the sum of the photon's energy and the electron's rest energy.

Wait, but in the rest frame, the initial energy is E_photon + mc², and the initial momentum is E_photon / c.

After the collision, the total energy is 3mc² + (3/2)mv², and the total momentum is 3mv.

Therefore, in the rest frame, the invariant E² - (p c)^2 is preserved.

So, the invariant before collision is (E_photon + mc²)^2 - (E_photon)^2

Compute:

= E_photon² + 2 E_photon mc² + mc⁴ - E_photon²


[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here where a photon strikes an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon gets destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The question is asking about the energy of the photon, and the options are A through D, with B being 2mc². I need to figure out why the correct answer is B.

First, let me try to visualize what's happening. We have a photon, which is a particle of light with no mass, and it's hitting an electron at rest. The electron is initially stationary, so it has zero kinetic energy. When the photon interacts with the electron, it somehow creates two more particles: an electron and a positron. The photon doesn't survive this interaction; it's destroyed.

After the collision, the positron and the two electrons move off at the same speed, all in the direction the photon was originally moving. So, the three particles—two electrons and one positron—all have the same velocity. Hmm, interesting. So, they all move together as if they're a combined system.

I think this is a problem involving conservation laws. Specifically, the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the photon is being destroyed and turned into these particles, energy must be conserved, and so does momentum.

Let me write down what I know.

1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before the collision should equal the total energy after the collision.
2. **Momentum Conservation**: Similarly, the momentum before should equal the momentum after.

Before the collision, there's the energy of the photon and the rest mass energy of the electron. The photon has energy E_photon, and the electron has rest energy mc². The total initial energy is E_initial = E_photon + mc².

After the collision, we have three particles: the original electron, the positron, and the second electron. All three are moving with the same speed, let's denote it as v. Therefore, their kinetic energies can be expressed using the relativistic kinetic energy formula. But wait, the problem mentions that they move off at equal speeds. It doesn't specify whether they are non-relativistic or relativistic. Since photons can have high energies, maybe we need to consider relativistic speeds here.

But let me think. For non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². For relativistic speeds, it's (gamma - 1)mc². Hmm, but if they are moving at equal speeds, but one is a positron and the others are electrons, maybe their masses are the same? Wait, the positron has the same mass as an electron, right? So, all three particles have the same mass, m.

Therefore, each of the three particles has the same kinetic energy if they are moving at the same speed. So, the kinetic energy for each is (gamma - 1)mc². Since there are two electrons and one positron, the total kinetic energy after the collision is 3*(gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, is that correct? Because in reality, the positron is the same mass as the electron, so yes, same mass. So, all three have the same kinetic energy.

But also, their rest masses contribute to the total energy. So, each particle's total energy is the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, which is (gamma)mc².

Therefore, the total energy after the collision is:

E_final = gamma*mc² + gamma*mc² + gamma*mc² = 3gamma*mc²

Wait, no, hold on. Let me be precise. The original electron is already at rest, so its initial energy is mc². After the collision, it's moving with speed v, so its energy is gamma*mc². The positron and the second electron are also moving with speed v, so each of their energies is gamma*mc². So, the total energy after the collision is:

E_final = gamma*mc² + gamma*mc² + gamma*mc² = 3gamma*mc²

But wait, that's not considering the initial rest mass energy of the original electron. Or is it? Hmm, no, wait. The original electron was at rest, so its energy was mc², and when it moves, its energy becomes gamma*mc². The positron and the second electron were created from the photon, so they didn't exist before. So, the total energy after the collision is the sum of the kinetic energies of the three particles plus their rest mass energies.

Wait, no. The rest mass energies of the particles are always mc² each. So, for each particle, their total energy is mc² + kinetic energy. So, yes, the total energy after collision is 3*(mc² + K), where K is the kinetic energy of each.

But before the collision, the total energy was E_photon + mc². So, setting them equal:

E_photon + mc² = 3*(mc² + K)

But K is (gamma - 1)mc² for each particle, so:

E_photon + mc² = 3*(mc² + (gamma - 1)mc²) = 3*(gamma*mc²)

Wait, so:

E_photon + mc² = 3gamma*mc²

Therefore, E_photon = (3gamma - 1)mc²

Hmm, but I don't know gamma yet. Maybe I can relate this to momentum.

So, let's consider the momentum before and after the collision.

Before collision: The photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc.

After collision: The three particles are moving with speed v, same for each. Therefore, their momenta are p = gamma*mv.

But since all three have the same speed, their momenta are equal. So, the total momentum after collision is 3*(gamma*mv).

But the initial momentum was p_photon = E_photon / c.

Since momentum is conserved:

E_photon / c = 3*gamma*mv

So, from this, we have E_photon = 3*gamma*mv*c

But we also have from the energy conservation that E_photon = (3gamma - 1)mc²

So, substituting E_photon from the momentum equation into the energy equation:

3*gamma*mv*c = (3gamma - 1)mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3*gamma*v*c = (3gamma - 1)c²

Divide both sides by c:

3*gamma*v = (3gamma - 1)c

So, 3gamma*v = 3gamma c - c

Let me rearrange:

3gamma*v - 3gamma c = -c

Factor out gamma:

gamma*(3v - 3c) = -c

Divide both sides by 3:

gamma*(v - c) = -c/3

Hmm, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, gamma is always positive. The right-hand side is negative, so (v - c) must be negative, meaning v < c, which is consistent with special relativity.

So,

gamma = (-c/3) / (v - c) = (c / 3) / (c - v)

So, gamma = c / [3(c - v)]

Now, let's go back to the energy equation:

E_photon = (3gamma - 1)mc²

We can write gamma as above:

gamma = c / [3(c - v)]

So, E_photon = [3*(c / [3(c - v)]) - 1]mc²

Simplify:

E_photon = [ (c / (c - v)) - 1 ] mc²

= [ (c - (c - v)) / (c - v) ] mc²

= [ v / (c - v) ] mc²

So,

E_photon = (v / (c - v)) * mc²

But from the momentum equation, E_photon = 3gamma mv c

But let's see if we can express E_photon in terms of v.

Alternatively, maybe we can write expressions in terms of beta, which is v/c.

Let me set beta = v/c, so beta < 1 because v < c.

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

Substituting back into E_photon:

E_photon = (3gamma - 1) mc²

But we also have from the momentum equation:

E_photon = 3gamma mv c

So, 3gamma mv c = (3gamma - 1) mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3gamma v c = (3gamma - 1)c²

Divide both sides by c:

3gamma v = (3gamma - 1)c

So,

3gamma v - 3gamma c = -c

Factor gamma:

gamma(3v - 3c) = -c

gamma = (-c) / (3v - 3c) = c / (3c - 3v) = c / [3(c - v)]

Which is the same as before.

Expressed in terms of beta:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So, c / [3(c - v)] = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

But let me express gamma in terms of beta:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = c / [3(c - v)]

But since beta = v/c, v = beta c. So,

gamma = c / [3(c - beta c)] = c / [3c(1 - beta)] = 1 / [3(1 - beta)]

So, gamma = 1 / [3(1 - beta)]

Therefore, substituting into E_photon:

E_photon = (3gamma - 1) mc²

= (3*(1 / [3(1 - beta)]) - 1) mc²

= (1 / (1 - beta) - 1) mc²

= ( (1 - (1 - beta)) / (1 - beta) ) mc²

= (beta / (1 - beta)) mc²

So,

E_photon = (beta / (1 - beta)) mc²

But also, E_photon = 3gamma mv c

But let's see if we can find beta in terms of the given.

Wait, we have:

E_photon = (beta / (1 - beta)) mc²

But we also have from the photon's energy:

E_photon = h f = 3gamma mv c

But perhaps we can express E_photon in terms of beta, as we have above.

Wait, but we also have that the three particles are moving at speed v, so their velocities are related to beta. So, maybe the total energy can be expressed in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the rest frame of the center of mass.

Wait, let me consider that after the collision, the three particles are moving together with the same speed. So, in that case, the center of mass is moving at that speed. But the photon initially is moving at speed c. So, perhaps the frame where the center of mass is at rest is moving at some speed relative to the photon's frame.

Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, another thought: Since all three particles are moving at the same speed after the collision, their combined system is like a single particle moving with velocity v. So, the total momentum is 3gamma mv, which is equal to the photon's momentum, E_photon / c.

So, E_photon = 3 gamma m v c

But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the invariant quantity in relativity, the rest mass energy, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, maybe I can use the relation between energy and momentum for the photon.

Photons have E = pc, so E_photon = p_photon c.

Then, from the conservation of momentum:

p_photon = 3 gamma m v

So, E_photon = 3 gamma m v c

But also, from energy conservation:

E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma m c²

So, combining these two equations:

E_photon = 3 gamma m v c

E_photon = 3 gamma m c² - mc²

So, set them equal:

3 gamma m v c = 3 gamma m c² - mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3 gamma v c = 3 gamma c² - c²

Bring all terms to one side:

3 gamma v c - 3 gamma c² + c² = 0

Factor gamma:

gamma (3 v c - 3 c²) + c² = 0

Factor 3c:

gamma (3 c (v - c)) + c² = 0

So,

3 c gamma (v - c) = -c²

Divide both sides by c:

3 gamma (v - c) = -c

So,

gamma (v - c) = -c / 3

Which is the same equation as before. So, we get:

gamma = c / [3(c - v)]

As before, which leads to gamma = 1 / [3(1 - beta)]

So, E_photon = (beta / (1 - beta)) mc²

But is there another way to find E_photon? Maybe considering that the rest mass energy is mc², and the photon is providing the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the created particles.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is just mc². The photon brings in E_photon. After the collision, the total rest mass remains the same because we created particles with the same rest mass as the original. Wait, we created two more electrons and a positron.

Wait, initial rest mass is just the electron: mc².

After collision, we have three particles: two electrons and a positron, each with rest mass mc². So, total rest mass energy is 3mc². But the system also has kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The initial electron was at rest, so its energy is mc². Then the photon comes in with E_photon. So, the total initial energy is mc² + E_photon, and the total final energy is the sum of the kinetic energies plus the rest masses.

But the total rest mass energy after is 3mc², and the total energy is 3 gamma mc² as I had before.

So, setting:

mc² + E_photon = 3 gamma mc²

Therefore, E_photon = (3 gamma - 1) mc²

Which is consistent with what I had earlier.

But we also have E_photon = 3 gamma mv c

So, 3 gamma mv c = (3 gamma - 1) mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3 gamma v c = (3 gamma - 1) c²

So, 3 gamma v = (3 gamma - 1) c

Which gives us gamma = c / [3(c - v)]

As before.

So, perhaps I need to express E_photon in terms of beta.

Given that gamma = 1 / [3(1 - beta)], and E_photon = (beta / (1 - beta)) mc².

Wait, so if I can find beta, maybe I can find E_photon.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the velocity of the center of mass.

After the collision, all three particles are moving at the same speed, so their center of mass is moving at that speed. The initial center of mass is moving at the photon's velocity, but the photon is massless, so the center of mass is tricky.

Wait, but before the collision, the system is the photon and the electron. The electron is at rest, so the center of mass is at the position of the electron. The photon is moving, so the center of mass velocity is a combination of the electron's rest frame and the photon's velocity.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, considering that after the collision, all three particles move at the same speed, so we can model the system as a single particle moving at speed v with mass 3m. Then, the photon's energy is converted into the rest mass energy of this system plus the kinetic energy.

But the photon's energy is E_photon, so in the center of mass frame of the three particles, the photon's energy must be enough to create the rest mass of the three particles plus their kinetic energy.

Wait, that might be a good approach. Let me think.

In the rest frame of the three particles, which is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, the photon's energy would be blueshifted.

In that rest frame, the photon's energy would need to equal the total rest mass energy of the three particles, which is 3mc², plus their kinetic energy. But in the rest frame of the three particles, their kinetic energy is zero, so the photon's energy in that frame should be 3mc².

Wait, that's an interesting thought. Because in the rest frame of the three particles, they are at rest, so their total energy is 3mc², and the photon must come in with that same energy.

But in the lab frame, where the photon is moving with energy E_photon, the rest frame of the three particles is moving at speed v. Therefore, the photon's energy in that frame is related to its energy in the lab frame by a Doppler shift factor.

So, the energy in the rest frame of the three particles is E'_photon = E_photon * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta is v/c. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the Doppler shift formula when moving from frame S (lab) to frame S' (moving at speed v relative to S) is:

E'_photon = E_photon * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

Because the photon is moving opposite to the direction of S' motion if S' is moving in the direction of the photon.

Wait, let me recall the Doppler effect in special relativity. The formula is:

E'_ = E * (gamma (1 - beta cos theta))

In the case where the photon is moving in the direction opposite to S', theta = pi, so cos theta = -1.

Therefore,

E'_ = E_photon * gamma (1 + beta)

So, E'_photon = E_photon *
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B, which is 2mc². Let me try to walk through my thought process step by step.

The problem states: A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was... with options given.

Hmm, I remember that when a photon interacts with matter, it can create particle-antiparticle pairs. In this case, the photon creates an electron-positron pair. The key here is conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the electron was initially at rest, the photon must be providing the necessary energy to create the pair. The total energy before the collision is just the energy of the photon because the electron is at rest. After the collision, we have three particles: a positron, an electron, and another electron. All three move off with equal speeds. So, their momenta will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction? Wait, no, they all move in the same direction as the initial photon. Hmm, maybe I need to think about how momentum and energy are conserved here.

Let me recall some formulas. The energy of a photon is given by E_photon = hc/λ or E_photon = pc, since for photons, E = pc. The rest mass energy of an electron is mc². Now, when the photon creates an electron-positron pair, the total energy after the collision must be equal to the energy of the photon before the collision. But wait, the photon is destroyed, so its energy is converted into the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies of the particles.

But hold on, the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, their kinetic energies are equal. Since they all have the same speed, their kinetic energies are the same. Let me denote their speed as v.

So, the total energy after the collision is the sum of the energies of the three particles. The positron and two electrons each have rest mass energy mc², and each has kinetic energy (1/2)mv². So, total energy after collision is 3mc² + 3*(1/2)mv². Since the photon's energy is entirely converted into this, that should equal the initial photon energy, which is E_photon.

But the problem is about what the energy of the photon was, so E_photon is equal to 3mc² + (3/2)mv². But wait, we don't know the value of v. Hmm, maybe I need another equation from conservation of momentum.

The initial momentum is just the momentum of the photon, since the electron is at rest. The photon's momentum is E_photon/c, which is (pc, since E = pc for photons). So, p_initial = E_photon/c.

After the collision, we have three particles: positron and two electrons, all moving with speed v. Since they all have the same speed, their momenta are each p = mv. But they are moving in the same direction as the initial photon, so the total momentum after the collision is 3mv.

Therefore, we have:

E_photon/c = 3mv.

But E_photon is also equal to the total energy after collision, which is 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

So, let me write that:

E_photon = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

But from momentum, E_photon/c = 3mv, so E_photon = 3mv c.

So, substituting E_photon from momentum into energy equation:

3mv c = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

Let me divide both sides by 3m to simplify:

v c = c² + (v²)/2.

Wait, let me rearrange terms:

v c - (v²)/2 = c².

Multiply both sides by 2:

2v c - v² = 2c².

Hmm, let me write this as:

-v² + 2v c - 2c² = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

v² - 2v c + 2c² = 0.

This is a quadratic in v. Let me write it as:

v² - 2c v + 2c² = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

v = [2c ± sqrt((2c)^2 - 8c²)] / 2

Simplify sqrt(4c² - 8c²) = sqrt(-4c²). Wait, that's imaginary. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check my steps again. I had:

E_photon = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

E_photon = 3mv c.

So, setting equal:

3mv c = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

Divide both sides by 3m:

v c = c² + (v²)/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, moving terms:

v c - (v²)/2 = c².

Multiply both sides by 2:

2v c - v² = 2c².

So, v² - 2v c + 2c² = 0.

Quadratic in v: discriminant is (2c)^2 - 4*1*2c² = 4c² - 8c² = -4c².

Negative discriminant, which suggests complex roots. That doesn't make sense because velocity can't be imaginary.

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, is the positron moving in the same direction as the electrons? The problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. So, all three are moving in the same direction. Hmm, but the initial momentum was in that direction as well.

Wait, but the positron is the result of the annihilation of the photon with the electron. Since the electron was at rest, the photon must have given enough energy to create both particles, and then the positron and the two electrons move off.

But wait, why two electrons? Because when the photon interacts with an electron, it can create an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron is transformed into a positron and an electron. So, that would give two electrons and a positron. So, in total, three particles: two electrons and one positron. So, they all have to move off with the same speed?

Wait, but if the original electron was at rest, and the photon gives it energy to create the pair, the total momentum of the system after the collision must equal the initial momentum of the photon.

But if all three particles move off with equal speed, their momenta are equal, so 3mv in the direction of the photon. So, the initial momentum was E_photon/c, which must equal 3mv.

Hence, E_photon = 3mv c.

But then, the energy conservation: the photon's energy is converted into the rest mass energy of the particles plus their kinetic energies.

But the rest mass energy of each is mc², so for three particles, it's 3mc². Plus, each has kinetic energy (1/2)mv², so total kinetic energy is 3*(1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².

Thus, E_photon = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

But we also have E_photon = 3mv c.

So, equate them: 3mv c = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

Divide both sides by 3m: v c = c² + (v²)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: 2v c - v² = 2c².

Rearranged: v² - 2v c + 2c² = 0.

Quadratic equation: v = [2c ± sqrt{(2c)^2 - 8c²}]/2 = [2c ± sqrt{4c² - 8c²}]/2 = [2c ± sqrt{-4c²}]/2.

Hmm, the discriminant is negative, which suggests no real solution. That can't be, because v must be a real number.

Wait, so maybe my assumption that all three particles have the same speed is wrong?

But the problem says they move off at equal speeds. Hmm, does that mean equal speeds but maybe opposite directions? Wait, but the problem states: "the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon."

So, same direction as the photon.

Wait, so same direction, same speed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the positron and one electron move in one direction, and the other electron moves in the opposite direction? But the problem says "along the initial direction of the photon," so same direction.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the conservation laws. Let's think again.

The initial energy is E_photon = pc.

The initial momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = pc.

After collision, we have three particles: positron, electron, electron.

Each has mass m, so rest energy 3mc².

Each has kinetic energy depending on their velocity.

But also, their momenta: each has momentum p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But all three have the same speed v, so same gamma. So total momentum is 3 gamma m v.

Which equals initial momentum: 3 gamma m v = p_photon = E_photon / c.

But E_photon is also equal to 3mc² + 3*(1/2)mv².

Wait, so E_photon = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

But also, E_photon = 3 gamma m c².

Wait, no, because for each particle, their total energy is gamma m c², so total energy is 3 gamma m c².

So, E_photon = 3 gamma m c².

So, from energy conservation:

3 gamma m c² = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

So, let's divide both sides by 3m:

gamma c² = c² + (v²)/2.

So, gamma c² - c² = v² / 2.

Factor out c²:

c² (gamma - 1) = v² / 2.

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, gamma - 1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) - 1.

Let me denote beta = v/c, so beta is less than 1.

Then, gamma - 1 = (1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)) - 1.

So, substituting back:

c² [ (1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)) - 1 ] = (beta² c²) / 2.

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)) - 1 = beta² / 2.

Let me write this as:

1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + beta² / 2.

Let me denote x = beta². So, 1 / sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + x / 2.

Square both sides:

1 / (1 - x) = (1 + x / 2)^2.

Expand the right side:

(1 + x / 2)^2 = 1 + x + x² / 4.

So,

1 / (1 - x) = 1 + x + x² / 4.

Multiply both sides by (1 - x):

1 = (1 + x + x² / 4)(1 - x).

Multiply out the right side:

1*(1 - x) + x*(1 - x) + (x² / 4)*(1 - x)

= (1 - x) + (x - x²) + (x² / 4 - x³ / 4)

Simplify term by term:

1 - x + x - x² + x² / 4 - x³ / 4.

Simplify:

1 + (-x + x) + (-x² + x² / 4) - x³ / 4.

So, 1 + 0 + (-3x² / 4) - x³ / 4.

So, 1 - (3x²)/4 - (x³)/4 = 1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

- (3x²)/4 - (x³)/4 = 0.

Factor out -x²/4:

- x²/4 (3 + x) = 0.

So, solutions are x = 0 or x = -3.

But x = beta², which is non-negative, so x = 0 is the only solution.

But x = 0 implies beta = 0, which would mean v = 0. But that would mean the particles are not moving, which contradicts the statement that they move off at equal speeds.

Hmm, seems like this approach leads to a contradiction. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, is the problem that I assumed all three particles have the same speed? Maybe they have the same speed, but different directions?

Wait, no, the problem says "move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon." So, same speed, same direction.

So, their velocities are equal, direction same as the photon.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the momentum would be additive, and we end up with 3mv, but earlier, when I tried to solve for v, the quadratic gave a negative discriminant. So, maybe I need to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the original electron is being annihilated? So, it's not that the photon is just transferring energy to the electron, but rather creating a new electron and a positron, while the original electron is destroyed.

Wait, so the initial electron is at rest, and the photon creates an electron-positron pair. So, the original electron is gone, replaced by a positron and an electron, each carrying away momentum.

But in that case, the total mass is still the same, since the original electron (mass m) is converted into two particles, each mass m. So, the total mass remains 2m? No, wait, no, wait. If you have an initial electron at rest, it's just one particle of mass m. After the collision, you have two electrons and a positron, each of mass m. So, the total mass is 3m? But mass is not conserved in that sense because energy is being converted into rest mass. Wait, no—mass is conserved because the rest masses are the same.

Wait, wait, the original electron is at rest, mass m. After the collision, we have a positron (mass m) and two electrons (each mass m). So, total rest mass is 3m, but the energy of the photon is being converted into kinetic energy and rest mass.

Wait, but energy is not conserved in the sense of rest mass, because the photon has energy which gets converted into kinetic energy and rest mass. So, the total energy after collision is more than the initial rest mass.

Wait, but the problem says the photon is destroyed, so the energy of the photon is converted into the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy of the particles. So, the total energy after collision is equal to the energy of the photon before collision.

But in that case, since the original electron is at rest, the rest mass energy is mc², and the photon's energy is E_photon. After the collision, the rest mass is 3mc², and the kinetic energy is the remaining energy. So,

E_photon = 3mc² + K,

where K is the total kinetic energy.

But also, momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum is E_photon/c, the total momentum after collision is 3mv, since all three particles have the same velocity v.

So, E_photon/c = 3mv.

Therefore, E_photon = 3mv c.

But we also have E_photon = 3mc² + K.

So, 3mv c = 3mc² + K.

But K is the total kinetic energy, which is 3*(1/2)mv² = (3/2)mv².

Thus,

3mv c = 3mc² + (3/2)mv².

Divide both sides by 3m:

v c = c² + (v²)/2.

Which is the equation I had before, leading to a quadratic with negative discriminant.

Wait, so maybe this scenario is impossible, meaning that the initial assumption that the photon can create the pair with all three moving at the same speed is invalid.

But the problem states that the photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, maybe the problem is correct, but my reasoning is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question because the total rest mass energy is 3mc², so the photon must have energy greater than or equal to that. But 2mc² is less than 3mc², so that can't be.

Wait, wait, wait, the rest mass is 3mc², but the kinetic energy is (3/2)mv², so the total energy is 3mc² + (3/2)mv². But if the photon's energy is 2mc², can that be enough?

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is assuming that the kinetic energies of the particles are equal, but not necessarily that their speeds are equal? Hmm, no, the problem says equal speeds.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the positron and one electron move in the opposite direction, while the other electron moves in the same direction? But the problem says they all move in the initial direction of the photon.

Alternatively, maybe the positron is moving in the opposite direction, but the two electrons move in the same direction as the photon.

Wait, but the problem says "the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon." So, all three are moving in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming non-relativistic speeds? Let me see.

If we assume that the kinetic energy is non-relativistic, so kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², then total energy is 3mc² + (3/2
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here about a photon striking an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon disappears, and the three particles—positron and two electrons—move off at equal speeds in the same direction as the original photon. The question is asking about the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc². The correct answer is supposed to be B, 2mc², but I want to figure out why.

Okay, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. When a photon interacts with an electron, it can transfer its energy to the electron, causing the electron to emit radiation or, in this case, create a pair of particles. The process described here is similar to the inverse Compton scattering, but instead of just scattering, it's creating a pair. Hmm, or maybe it's more like pair production. Wait, pair production usually refers to a photon creating an electron-positron pair out of the vacuum, but here the electron is already present. So maybe it's a variation of that.

In pair production, a photon with energy >= 2mc² is required because of conservation laws—energy and momentum. Since the photon doesn't have any rest mass, its energy and momentum must be conserved. When it creates the electron-positron pair, both of which have rest mass mc, the combined rest mass energy is 2mc². So the photon must have at least that much energy. Therefore, the minimum energy is 2mc², which matches the answer given.

But let me think through it step by step to make sure.

So, initially, the photon has energy E and momentum p = E/c (since momentum of a photon is E/c). The electron is at rest, so its energy is its rest energy, mc², and momentum is zero.

After the collision, there are three particles: the positron and two electrons. All move off at equal speeds v in the same direction as the photon. So, let's denote each particle's energy as gamma*v*(rest energy). But since each particle has the same speed, their gamma factors will be the same.

Let me denote the speed as v, so each particle's energy is gamma*mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since they are moving at the same speed, their gamma factors are equal.

Wait, but the positron and the two electrons: each has rest mass mc, so their energies are each gamma*mc².

So total energy after the collision is 3*gamma*mc².

Similarly, total momentum is 3*gamma*mv/c, where m is the mass of the electron. But wait, wait, in the initial state, the momentum is just the photon's momentum, p = E/c. In the final state, the total momentum is 3*(gamma*m*v). But since v is the same for each, it's 3*(gamma*m*v). So we can set up the conservation equations.

So, conservation of energy: E_photon = 3*gamma*mc².

Conservation of momentum: E_photon/c = 3*(gamma*m*v).

Now, from conservation of energy, we have E_photon = 3 gamma mc².

From momentum, E_photon/c = 3 gamma m v.

So let's take the ratio of momentum equation to energy equation:

(E_photon/c) / (E_photon) ) = (3 gamma m v) / (3 gamma m c²)

Simplify left side: 1/c

Right side: v / c²

So 1/c = v / c² => v = c.

Wait, that's interesting. So all particles move at speed v = c. But that can't be right, because nothing can go faster than c. Wait, so that suggests that the only way both equations can be satisfied is if v = c.

But then, gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - c²/c²) = 1/0, which is undefined. Hmm, that suggests a problem. So perhaps we are missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the particles cannot all move at speed c, so that suggests that we can't have all three particles moving at the same speed unless we have some other condition. Maybe the speeds are not equal, but wait, the problem says they move off at equal speeds.

Wait, maybe I made an incorrect assumption. Let me double-check.

Wait, if all three particles are moving at speed v, which is less than c, then gamma is finite, and we can have a consistent solution.

But wait, in our momentum and energy equations, substituting v in terms of E_photon, we get that v is c, which is a contradiction.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is that if the particles are moving at equal speeds, the only solution is that v = c, which is impossible because photons don't have mass, and particles can't go at speed c in that scenario.

Hmm, so maybe the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me think again.

When a photon collides with an electron, and creates a pair, the process is photon -> e+ + e- + photon? No, in this case, the photon is destroyed, so photon + e- -> e+ + e- + e-? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, actually, the initial setup is a photon hitting an electron at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed, and the three particles move off at equal speeds.

So, initial particles: photon (energy E, momentum E/c) and electron (energy mc², momentum 0).

Final particles: positron (energy gamma mc², momentum gamma mv/c), electron (same as positron?), and another electron (same as the first? Wait, hold on.

Wait, no. If the photon is absorbed by the electron, which then emits a positron and another electron, or perhaps the three particles are the two electrons and the positron.

Wait, in that case, the initial system is the photon and the electron. After the collision, the system becomes three particles: two electrons and a positron.

But if the photon is destroyed, so total energy after collision is equal to the initial energy, right? So initial energy: E_photon + mc².

Final energy: (2 electrons and 1 positron), each with energy gamma mc², so total 3 gamma mc².

So, E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma mc² => E_photon = (3 gamma - 1) mc².

Similarly, initial momentum: E_photon / c.

Final momentum: 3 gamma m v.

So, E_photon / c = 3 gamma m v => v = E_photon / (3 gamma m c).

But from energy, E_photon = (3 gamma - 1) mc².

So, substitute into v:

v = ( (3 gamma - 1) mc² ) / (3 gamma m c ) = (3 gamma - 1) c / (3 gamma )

Simplify: v = c (1 - 1/(3 gamma)).

But since v must be less than c, 1 - 1/(3 gamma) < 1, which is okay.

But also, from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is a function of v, which complicates things.

Wait, maybe we can relate gamma and v.

But perhaps another approach is to use the invariant quantity, the square of the total four-momentum.

In the initial state, the total four-momentum is the four-momentum of the photon plus the four-momentum of the electron.

The photon's four-momentum is (E/c, E/c, 0, 0), assuming it's moving along the x-axis.

The electron's four-momentum is (mc, 0, 0, 0).

So the total four-momentum is (E/c + mc, E/c, 0, 0).

In the final state, the four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the two electrons and the positron.

Each particle has four-momentum (gamma m c, gamma m v, 0, 0), assuming they are moving along the x-axis.

Since all three particles have the same speed v, their gamma factors are the same.

So, the total four-momentum is (3 gamma m c, 3 gamma m v, 0, 0).

The invariant mass squared is (E_total/c)^2 - (p_total)^2.

So, in initial state, it's ( (E_photon + mc²)/c )² - ( E_photon / c )².

In the final state, it's (3 gamma mc² / c )² - (3 gamma m v )².

Since the invariant mass squared must be the same in both cases.

So let's compute that.

Initial invariant mass squared:

[ (E_photon + mc²)/c ]² - (E_photon / c )²

= [ (E_photon + mc²)² - E_photon² ] / c²

= [ E_photon² + 2 E_photon mc² + (mc²)^2 - E_photon² ] / c²

= (2 E_photon mc² + m² c^4) / c²

= (2 E_photon m c² + m² c^4) / c²

= 2 E_photon m / c + m² c²

Final invariant mass squared:

[ (3 gamma m c² ) / c ]² - (3 gamma m v )²

= (3 gamma m c² )² / c² - (3 gamma m v )²

= 9 gamma² m² c^4 / c² - 9 gamma² m² v²

= 9 gamma² m² c² - 9 gamma² m² v²

Factor out 9 gamma² m²:

= 9 gamma² m² ( c² - v² )

But c² - v² = 1 / (gamma²), because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) => 1/gamma² = 1 - v²/c² => v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So, c² - v² = 1 / gamma².

Therefore, final invariant mass squared is:

9 gamma² m² * (1 / gamma² ) = 9 m².

So, invariant mass squared is 9 m².

Therefore, initial invariant mass squared must also be 9 m².

So, set initial invariant mass squared equal to 9 m².

From earlier, initial invariant mass squared is 2 E_photon m / c + m² c².

Set equal to 9 m²:

2 E_photon m / c + m² c² = 9 m².

Divide both sides by m²:

2 E_photon / (c m) + c² = 9.

Let me denote x = E_photon / (m c²), so E_photon = x m c².

Then 2 x / c * c m / m = 2 x + c² = 9.

Wait, actually, let's do substitution properly.

Wait, 2 E_photon m / c + m² c² = 9 m².

Divide both sides by m²:

2 E_photon / (m c) + c² = 9.

Let me set E_photon = k m c², so k is the multiple.

So, 2 k m c² / (m c) + c² = 9 => 2 k c + c² = 9.

So, 2k c = 9 - c² => k = (9 - c²)/(2 c).

But wait, this seems problematic because c is a constant, and the result would be k proportional to c, which is a dimension of velocity, but k is a pure number (since E_photon = k m c²).

Hmm, so perhaps I made a substitution error.

Let me go back.

Initial invariant mass squared: 2 E_photon m / c + m² c² = 9 m².

Divide both sides by m²:

2 E_photon / (c m) + c² = 9.

So, let me write 2 E_photon / (c m) = 9 - c².

Therefore, E_photon = ( (9 - c² ) / 2 ) * c m.

But this gives E_photon proportional to c, which is a problem because E_photon should have units of energy, which in natural units is same as mass times c². So, if E_photon is (something with c) * m c, that would be (c m c) = m c² * c? No, wait, E_photon is (9 - c²)/2 * c m, which is (9 - c²)/2 * m c. Hmm, but 9 - c² is unitless, so multiplied by m c, gives units of energy.

But in any case, this suggests that E_photon must be proportional to c times m, but given that, the only way for E_photon to have the correct units is that the term (9 - c²) would have to be unitless, which it is, and multiplied by c m, gives E_photon.

But since c² is a term with units of velocity squared, 9 is unitless, so 9 - c² would have units of velocity squared, which makes E_photon have units of velocity * mass, which is not correct. Therefore, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe an error in calculation when substituting the invariant masses.

Let me go back step by step.

In the initial state, the four-momentum is (E_photon + mc², E_photon, 0, 0) in (E, p_x, p_y, p_z).

Then, the invariant mass squared is (E_total/c)^2 - (p_total)^2.

So, E_total = E_photon + mc², p_total = E_photon / c.

So, invariant mass squared is ( (E_photon + mc²)/c )² - (E_photon / c )².

Compute that: (E_photon + mc²)^2 / c² - E_photon² / c².

Expand numerator: (E_photon² + 2 E_photon mc² + m² c^4) - E_photon².

So, 2 E_photon mc² + m² c^4, over c².

Thus, invariant mass squared is (2 E_photon m c² + m² c^4 ) / c² = 2 E_photon m / c + m² c².

That's correct.

In the final state, the invariant mass squared is (3 gamma m c² / c )² - (3 gamma m v )².

So, (3 gamma m c² )² / c² - (3 gamma m v )².

Compute each term:

First term: 9 gamma² m² c^4 / c² = 9 gamma² m² c².

Second term: 9 gamma² m² v².

So, total invariant mass squared is 9 gamma² m² (c² - v²).

But since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), 1 - v²/c² = 1 / gamma².

Therefore, c² - v² = c² (1 - v²/c² ) = c² / gamma².

Thus, invariant mass squared is 9 gamma² m² * (c² / gamma² ) = 9 m² c².

Wait, hold on, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, the invariant mass squared in the final state is 9 m² c².

Wait, earlier I thought it was 9 m², but that was incorrect. It should be 9 m² c².

So, set initial invariant mass squared equal to final invariant mass squared.

Thus,

2 E_photon m / c + m² c² = 9 m² c².

So, 2 E_photon m / c = 9 m² c² - m² c² = 8 m² c².

Therefore, 2 E_photon m / c = 8 m² c².

Multiply both sides by c / (2 m):

E_photon = (8 m² c² * c ) / (2 m ) = (8 m² c^3 ) / (2 m ) = 4 m c^3 / 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Energy can't be proportional to c^3, because in natural units, energy is in units of mc², which is m c². So, unless I messed up the units.

Wait, wait, no. Let me do the dimensional analysis.

E_photon should have units of energy, which is mass times velocity squared, so m c².

But here, E_photon = 4 m c^3.

Wait, but c^3 has units of velocity cubed, and m has units of mass. So, m c^3 has units of mass * velocity^3, which is not energy. That's incorrect.

So, that suggests that I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, going back to the invariant masses.

In the final state, invariant mass squared is 9 gamma² m² (c² - v² ). But c² - v² is a term with units of velocity squared, so 9 gamma² m² (velocity squared).

But invariant mass squared should have units of (mass)^2, so 9 gamma² m² (c² - v² ) must have units of mass squared.

But (c² - v² ) is (velocity squared), so gamma is unitless, so 9 gamma² m² (velocity squared) must be mass squared. Which implies that (velocity squared) must be (mass squared) / (m²), which is not possible. Therefore, I must have messed up in computing the invariant mass.

Wait, no, wait.

Hold on, in the final state, each particle has four-momentum (gamma m c, gamma m v, 0, 0 ). So, the sum is 3 gamma m c in energy, and 3 gamma m v in momentum.

But the invariant mass is sqrt( (E_total / c )² - (p_total )² ).

So, (E_total / c )² - (p_total )².

Which is (3 gamma m c² / c )² - (3 gamma m v
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B, which is 2mc². Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a photon with a certain energy hits an electron initially at rest. This interaction creates an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed in the process, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. We need to find the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc².

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when a photon interacts with matter, it can cause pair production, which is the creation of an electron-positron pair. But wait, pair production usually requires the presence of a nucleus or another particle to carry off the extra energy and momentum, right? Because, as far as I recall, in a vacuum, a photon alone can't produce an electron-positron pair because of conservation laws. But in this problem, the electron is at rest, so maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, actually, if an electron is at rest and a photon hits it, it can transfer some of its energy to the electron, but for pair production, we need to create two additional particles: a positron and an electron. So, the photon's energy must be sufficient to create these two particles. But I also remember that for pair production, the minimum energy required is 2mc², which is twice the rest mass energy of the electron because we need to create two electrons (one positron, which has the same mass as an electron, and one electron). So that would make sense why the answer is 2mc². But let me go through the problem again more carefully.

The photon strikes an electron at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the photon's initial direction. So the photon's energy is used to create these three particles? Wait, no, hold on—the original electron is there, and then we have a positron and another electron? Wait, actually, the original electron is struck by the photon, so it must have been promoted to a higher energy state. But then the problem says the photon is destroyed, so that implies the photon's energy is completely converted into the rest mass of the particles or their kinetic energies.

Wait, but if the original electron is at rest, and the photon hits it, then some of the photon's energy is absorbed by the electron, giving it kinetic energy, and the rest is used to create the positron and the second electron. So in total, the energy of the photon is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the positron and the second electron plus the kinetic energies of all three particles. But wait, the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, does that mean the two electrons (the original one and the new one) and the positron all have the same speed?

Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think. The original electron is at rest, so when the photon hits it, the electron can absorb some energy, giving it kinetic energy, and the photon's energy minus that absorbed energy is enough to create a positron and an electron. But the positron and the new electron will have some kinetic energy as well, right?

Wait, but the problem says that after the collision, the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So that means all three particles have the same velocity. So the original electron, which was at rest, is now moving with the same speed as the positron and the other electron. So that implies that their kinetic energies are all equal.

Okay, so if I think about conservation of energy and momentum here, because the photon is initially moving in a certain direction, but after the collision, all three particles are moving in the same direction with equal speeds. So the initial momentum of the photon is transferred entirely to the three particles.

But the photon has momentum equal to E/c, where E is the energy of the photon. So the initial momentum is E/c in the direction of the photon. After the collision, the total momentum is the sum of the momentum of each particle.

Each particle has mass m, so each has momentum p = gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor and v is the speed. Since all three particles are moving at speed v, their momenta are p = gamma*m*v each. Since there are three particles, the total momentum after the collision is 3*gamma*m*v.

But before the collision, the photon's momentum is E/c. So, setting these equal:

E/c = 3*gamma*m*v

But we also need to consider energy conservation. The total energy before the collision is just the energy of the photon, E_photon, because the electron is initially at rest, so its rest energy is mc², but if the photon is striking it, the rest energy of the electron would be part of the system's energy. Wait, but actually, when the photon interacts with the electron, the total energy is the sum of the photon's energy and the electron's rest energy. But wait, is that correct?

No, actually, when an electron is at rest, its energy is mc². When a photon hits it, the total energy before the collision is the photon's energy plus the electron's rest energy. After the collision, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three moving particles, which include their rest masses and their kinetic energies.

So, let's denote E_photon as the energy of the photon. The initial total energy is E_photon + mc² (since the electron is at rest, contributing mc²). The final total energy is the sum of the energies of the positron, the original electron (now moving), and the new electron (from pair production). Each of these has energy gamma*m*c², so total energy is 3*gamma*m*c².

Wait, but hold on, the positron has the same mass as the electron, so each particle's rest energy is mc². So the total rest energy is 3*mc². But since they are moving, each has kinetic energy as well, so the total energy is higher than 3*mc².

So, the initial energy is E_photon + mc², and the final energy is 3*gamma*m*c².

Therefore, we have:

E_photon + mc² = 3*gamma*m*c²

We can write this as:

E_photon = (3*gamma - 1)*m*c²

But we also have the momentum equation from before:

E_photon/c = 3*gamma*m*v

But I can express v in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1/gamma² = 1 - v²/c², which implies v = c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Alternatively, we can write v = (c²/gamma)*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, let's solve for v in terms of gamma:

From gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Substituting back into the momentum equation:

E_photon/c = 3*gamma*m*c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

So, E_photon = 3*gamma*m*c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

But we also have E_photon = (3*gamma - 1)*m*c² from the energy conservation.

So, set these equal:

3*gamma*m*c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = (3*gamma - 1)*m*c²

We can divide both sides by m*c²:

3*gamma*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 3*gamma - 1

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but let's try to solve for gamma.

Let me denote x = gamma to make it easier.

So, 3x*sqrt(1 - 1/x²) = 3x - 1

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

[3x*sqrt(1 - 1/x²)]² = (3x - 1)²

Which gives:

9x²*(1 - 1/x²) = 9x² - 6x + 1

Simplify the left side:

9x² - 9 = 9x² - 6x + 1

Subtract 9x² from both sides:

-9 = -6x + 1

Bring constants to one side:

-10 = -6x

Divide both sides by -6:

x = 10/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667

So, gamma is 5/3.

So, now, gamma = 5/3, so let's go back to the energy equation.

E_photon = (3*gamma - 1)*m*c² = (3*(5/3) - 1)*m*c² = (5 - 1)*m*c² = 4*m*c².

Wait, but that would mean E_photon is 4mc², which is option D. But the problem says the correct answer is B, 2mc². So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me check my steps.

First, I considered the initial momentum of the photon as E_photon/c, which is correct.

After the collision, the three particles have momentum 3*gamma*m*v each, so total momentum is 3*gamma*m*v. That's correct.

Then, I considered energy conservation. The initial energy is E_photon + mc², which is correct because the electron is at rest with energy mc².

The final energy is 3*gamma*m*c², which is considering that each particle has energy gamma*m*c² due to their motion. But wait, is that accurate? Each particle's total energy is gamma*m*c², right? So adding them up gives 3*gamma*m*c², yes.

So the equation is E_photon + mc² = 3*gamma*m*c².

Then, from momentum, E_photon/c = 3*gamma*m*v.

Expressing v in terms of gamma: v = c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Then, substituting into the momentum equation, we have:

E_photon = 3*gamma*m*c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

So E_photon is equal to both expressions:

3*gamma*m*c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = (3*gamma - 1)*m*c²

Divide both sides by m*c²:

3*gamma*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 3*gamma - 1

Then, square both sides:

9x²*(1 - 1/x²) = 9x² - 6x + 1

Which becomes:

9x² - 9 = 9x² - 6x + 1

Subtract 9x²:

-9 = -6x + 1

Then, -10 = -6x => x = 10/6 = 5/3.

Then, E_photon = (3*(5/3) -1)m*c² = (5 -1)m*c²=4mc².

Hmm, so according to this, the energy is 4mc², which is option D. But the correct answer is supposed to be B. 2mc². So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe my initial assumption about the total energy is incorrect. Because the original electron is being hit by the photon, so the total initial energy is E_photon + mc² (the electron's rest energy). After the collision, we have three particles moving, each with energy gamma*m*c². So total final energy is 3*gamma*m*c², which is correct.

But maybe I should also consider the annihilation of the photon. Wait, no, the photon is destroyed, so its energy is completely converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the particles. So that part is okay.

Wait, but hold on, when a photon hits an electron, the energy might not just be enough for pair production. Because in pair production, you need to conserve both energy and momentum. But in this case, since the electron is initially at rest, the photon must provide enough energy to create the two particles (electron and positron) and also provide the necessary momentum.

But wait, another thought: when an electron is at rest, and a photon hits it, the process is like Compton scattering, but here it's creating an electron-positron pair. So, the energy of the photon must be at least 2mc² because you need to create two particles each with rest mass mc². But in the problem, after the collision, all three particles (original electron, new electron, and positron) are moving at the same speed. So, their kinetic energies are non-zero, but also, the photon's energy is used to create their kinetic energy and their rest masses.

Wait, so maybe I need to set the photon's energy equal to the total rest mass of the two new particles plus the kinetic energy of all three particles. But no, actually, the original electron is already there, so its rest mass is counted in the initial energy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it differently.

Since all three particles move at the same speed, their kinetic energies are equal. So, the total kinetic energy is 3*(1/2)m*v², plus the rest energies, which are 3*mc². The total energy of the system is the initial energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the original electron (mc²), so:

E_photon + mc² = 3*(1/2)m*v² + 3*mc²

Simplify:

E_photon = 3*(1/2)m*v² + 2mc²

But the momentum of the system after collision is 3*gamma*m*v, which must equal the initial momentum of the photon, E_photon/c.

So, E_photon = 3*gamma*m*v*c

But from the energy equation:

E_photon = 3*(1/2)m*v² + 2mc²

So, set them equal:

3*gamma*m*v*c = 3*(1/2)m*v² + 2mc²

Divide both sides by m:

3*gamma*v*c = (3/2)v² + 2c²

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but let's express v in terms of gamma.

Again, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Let me substitute v:

3*gamma*(c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²))*c = (3/2)*(c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²))² + 2c²

Simplify each side.

Left side:

3*gamma*c²*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Right side:

(3/2)*c²*(1 - 1/gamma²) + 2c²

So, factor out c²:

Left: 3*gamma*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Right: (3/2)*(1 - 1/gamma²) + 2

Simplify the right side:

(3/2 - 3/(2gamma²)) + 2 = (3/2 + 2) - 3/(2gamma²) = (7/2) - 3/(2gamma²)

So, equation becomes:

3*gamma*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 7/2 - 3/(2gamma²)

Multiply both sides by 2gamma² to eliminate denominators:

6gamma³*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 7gamma² - 3

Hmm, this seems more complicated. I think my initial approach was better, but I ended up getting E_photon = 4mc², which contradicts the given answer.

Wait, maybe I should think about the system differently. Since the original electron is at rest, and after the collision, it's moving with the same speed as the positron and the new electron, then all three have the same velocity v.

So, the total momentum is 3mv gamma, which equals the photon's momentum, E_photon /c.

So, 3mv gamma = E_photon /c

Also, the total energy is E_photon + mc² = 3 (gamma mc²) = 3 gamma mc²

Therefore, E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma mc²

Subtract mc²: E_photon = (3 gamma -1) mc²

And from momentum: E_photon = 3 gamma m v c

So, 3 gamma m v c = (3 gamma -1) mc²

Divide both sides by m c:

3 gamma v = (3 gamma -1) c

Express v in terms of gamma: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

Substitute:

3 gamma c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = (3 gamma -1) c

Divide both sides by c:

3 gamma sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = 3 gamma -1

Square both sides:

9 gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) = 9 gamma² - 6 gamma +1

Simplify left side:

9 gamma² -9 = 9 gamma² -6 gamma +1

Subtract 9 gamma²:

-9 = -6 gamma +1

So, -10 = -6 gamma => gamma = 10/6 = 5/3

So, gamma =5/3

Therefore, E_photon = (3*(5/3) -1)mc² = (5 -1)mc²=4mc²

But that's D, but correct answer is B, 2mc². So, this still doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that the original electron is moving at the same speed as the others is incorrect? Because the original electron was at rest, the new pair's kinetic energy might be different. Alternatively, maybe only two particles are moving? Wait, the problem says that the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, three particles: original electron, new electron, positron.
