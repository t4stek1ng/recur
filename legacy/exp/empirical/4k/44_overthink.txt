[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about white light normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an index of refraction of 1.33. On top of this puddle, there's a thin layer of oil with an index of refraction of 1.5. The oil is 500 nm thick. The question is asking which wavelength of light is most strongly reflected. The options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember something about thin films and interference. Since there's a thin oil layer on top of water, it might cause some interference effects when light reflects off both surfaces—oil-water and water-air. But wait, the oil is on the surface of water, so the light first hits the oil, then goes into water, and then reflects back. Hmm, actually, I think it's a bit more involved.

Wait, let's visualize this. White light is coming down normally, so all the light rays are perpendicular to the surface. The first thing the light hits is the oil layer. Some of it reflects off the top of the oil, and some goes through the oil and reflects off the water. Then the rest goes through the oil and into the water and reflects off the bottom of the water (puddle). After that, some light might even go through the water and into the air, but I think the question is about the reflected light, so it's the light that bounced off the oil or the water.

I remember that when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift. So, in this case, the oil has a higher refractive index than air (since oil is on top of water, which has air on its other side). Wait, no. The oil is on top of water, so air is on the other side of the water. Let me get that straight.

So, the incident medium is air, right? The first reflection is at the oil-water interface. The oil has a higher refractive index than water? Wait, oil's refractive index is 1.5, and water's is 1.33. So actually, oil is denser than water. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because oil is less dense than water, but has a higher refractive index. So, oil (1.5) on top of water (1.33). So, when light goes from air to oil, it slows down, then from oil to water, it speeds up because water has a lower refractive index.

Wait, now I'm confused. So, for reflection at the oil-water interface, the light is going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), which is a lower index. So, when light reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, does it undergo a phase shift? Wait, no, it's the opposite. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift. When it reflects off a lower refractive index, it doesn't.

So, let's think: the first reflection is at the oil-water interface. The light is going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). Wait, no, that's not right. The light comes from air, hits oil, then goes into water. So, when light reflects off the oil (air to oil), it goes from lower to higher refractive index (n_air=1.0 to n_oil=1.5), so reflection at the air-oil interface will have a phase shift of π. Then, the transmitted light goes into oil, travels through oil, then hits water. So, oil to water is lower refractive index (n=1.5 to n=1.33). So, when light reflects off water, it goes from oil to water, which is a lower refractive index, so no phase shift.

Wait, but I think the reflection at the oil-water interface is from oil to water, so oil has higher n, so reflection here will have a phase shift of π.

Wait, now I'm getting tangled. Let me try again.

First, the light comes from air into oil. The first reflection is at the air-oil interface. Since oil has a higher refractive index than air, the reflection here will undergo a phase shift of π.

Then, the transmitted part goes through oil into water. Now, at the oil-water interface, the light is going from oil to water, which is lower refractive index. So, reflection at oil-water interface will have no phase shift because it's reflecting off a lower refractive index medium.

So, in total, the first reflection (air-oil) has a phase shift of π, and the second reflection (oil-water) has no phase shift. So, when these two reflected waves interfere, the one from oil-water will be in phase with the incoming wave, while the one from air-oil is out of phase.

Wait, but actually, the two reflected waves—let me clarify:

1. First reflection: air-oil (n=1.0 to 1.5). Since it reflects off a higher n medium, it has a phase shift of π.

2. Second reflection: oil-water (n=1.5 to 1.33). Since it reflects off a lower n medium, no phase shift.

But then, what about the light that goes through oil, into water, and reflects off water's surface. Wait, water is on the puddle, so the light goes through oil, then water, and reflects off the water. So, the reflection at the water's surface is between water and air, right? Because water is in contact with air. Wait, no, the puddle is water, on top is oil, and then air.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should draw a diagram mentally.

So, the setup is:

Air (n=1.0) → Oil (n=1.5) → Water (n=1.33). The oil is 500 nm thick.

So, light comes from air, hits oil, then hits water, and then maybe goes into the water and reflects, or goes into the water, comes out, but we are considering reflected light.

Wait, reflections happen at the interfaces: air-oil, oil-water, and water-air. But water is next to oil and air. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider all possible reflections:

1. At air-oil: light reflects here. This reflection has a phase shift of π because it's going from lower to higher n.

2. Then, light goes through oil, hits water, reflects back. At oil-water interface, reflecting from oil to water, which is lower n, so no phase shift.

3. Then, light goes through oil, into water, then reflects off water's surface, which is between water and air (n=1.33 to 1.0). That reflection is from higher to lower n, so it will have a phase shift of π.

Wait, but this reflection is from water's surface, right? So, when the light goes into water, it travels to the water's surface, reflects, and comes back through oil.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think in terms of two reflected waves: one from oil (air-oil interface) and one from water (oil-water interface). But actually, the light can reflect off both oil and water, and those two reflections interfere.

Wait, but actually, the light hits oil, part of it reflects off oil (air-oil) with phase shift π, another part goes through oil, hits water, reflects off water with phase shift π (because reflecting from water to air is lower n, so phase shift π). Then, both of these reflected waves interfere with each other.

But wait, the path length difference also comes into play. The wave that reflects off the oil travels a shorter distance, right? Because it just reflects off the oil, while the other wave goes through oil, into water, and then comes back. So, the path length difference is twice the thickness of the oil layer (because it goes down and up).

So, let's denote:

- Reflection 1: air-oil, amplitude A1, phase shift π.

- Reflection 2: oil-water, amplitude A2, phase shift π? Wait, no. When reflecting from oil-water, the light is going from oil to water, so lower n, so no phase shift.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:

When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index than the incident medium, it undergoes a phase shift of π. If it reflects off a lower refractive index, no phase shift.

So, air (n=1.0) to oil (n=1.5): reflection at air-oil interface, n increases, so phase shift π.

Oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33): reflection at oil-water, n decreases, so no phase shift.

Water (n=1.33) to air (n=1.0): reflection at water's surface, n decreases, so phase shift π.

But in this setup, is the light reflecting off the water's surface? Because the question is about the reflected light, which would be the light that didn't go through the oil and water.

Wait, the light comes from air, some reflects off oil, some goes through oil, then reflects off water, and then comes back through oil. So, the reflected light consists of two components: the one that reflected off oil (air-oil) and the one that went through oil and water and reflected off water.

So, the first reflection (air-oil) has a phase shift of π. The second reflection (oil-water) has no phase shift, but the light that goes through oil and water has an additional path length: twice the thickness of the oil layer. Because it goes through oil to water and then back through oil, so 2*d.

So, for constructive interference, the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength, and the phase shifts should be considered.

But wait, in this case, the two reflections (air-oil and oil-water) have different phase shifts. The air-oil reflection has a phase shift of π, and the oil-water reflection has no phase shift. So, when these two reflected waves interfere, the one from oil-water doesn't have a phase shift, and the one from air-oil does.

But also, the path difference between the two reflected waves is 2*d, where d is the thickness of the oil layer (500 nm). So, the total phase difference is due to path length and phase shifts.

So, let's write the condition for constructive interference:

The phase difference between the two waves should be an integer multiple of 2π.

The phase difference comes from two sources:

1. The path difference: 2*d, which corresponds to a phase difference of (2π/λ) * 2d.

2. The phase shifts upon reflection: the wave reflecting off oil has a phase shift of π, while the wave reflecting off water does not. Therefore, there is a total phase difference of π between the two waves.

So, the total phase difference is:

Δφ = (2π/λ) * 2d + π

For constructive interference, Δφ = 2π m, where m is an integer.

So,

(4π d)/λ + π = 2π m

Divide both sides by π:

(4 d)/λ + 1 = 2m

So,

(4 d)/λ = 2m - 1

Thus,

λ = (4 d)/(2m - 1)

Given that d = 500 nm, let's plug that in:

λ = (4 * 500)/(2m - 1) = 2000/(2m -1)

So, we can compute λ for different integer values of m:

For m=1:

λ = 2000/(2*1 -1) = 2000/1 = 2000 nm

That's in the infrared, which is not one of the options.

For m=2:

λ = 2000/(4 -1) = 2000/3 ≈ 666.67 nm

Hmm, 666.67 nm is approximately 667 nm, but the closest option is D. 650 nm.

Wait, but 666 nm is close to 650. Maybe m=2 is the first order, but let's try m=3.

For m=3:

λ = 2000/(6 -1) = 2000/5 = 400 nm

That's in the blue region, which is also not one of the options.

Wait, but hold on. Maybe I need to consider the phase shifts differently.

Wait, actually, the phase shift upon reflection at the oil-water interface. When the light reflects off oil-water, it goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). So, lower refractive index, so no phase shift. But the reflection at the water's surface is from water to air, which is a lower refractive index, so that reflection has a phase shift of π.

But in our case, the light that reflects off the water comes back through the oil layer. So, actually, both reflections (oil-water and water-air) have happened? Or is it only reflecting at oil-water?

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to clarify.

The two reflected waves are:

1. The first reflection at oil's surface (air-oil), which has a phase shift of π.

2. The second reflection is at the water's surface (oil-water). Wait, no, the second reflection is at the oil-water interface, so light goes from oil to water. Since it's reflecting off a lower refractive index medium, there's no phase shift. But wait, the light that goes through oil and reflects off water is actually going through two interfaces: oil to water and then water to oil again. So, maybe the reflection off water's surface (water to air) is part of the path.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look up the formula for thin film interference when there are two reflections.

I remember that for a thin film, the condition for constructive interference is 2nd = (m + 1/2)λ, but that depends on whether there's a phase shift or not.

Wait, let's think again. When you have a thin film with two surfaces, the condition for constructive interference is:

2nd = (m + 1/2)λ, if there is a phase shift between the two reflected waves.

OR

2nd = mλ, if there is no phase shift.

Wait, so in our case, the two reflections are:

1. Air-oil: phase shift of π.

2. Oil-water: no phase shift.

But another reflection occurs at the water's surface, but that's inside the water. Wait, no, the water is the substrate.

Wait, maybe the only reflections that matter are the ones on the top surfaces: air-oil and oil-water.

So, going back, if the two reflections have different phase shifts, then the condition is:

Phase shift due to reflection: π from air-oil, and 0 from oil-water.

So, net phase shift is π.

Path difference: 2*d.

So, the condition for constructive interference is when the total phase difference is 2π m.

Therefore,

2π m = (2π / λ) * 2d + π

So, simplifying:

2π m = (4π d)/λ + π

Divide both sides by π:

2m = (4d)/λ + 1

So,

(4d)/λ = 2m -1

Thus,

λ = (4d)/(2m -1)

So, plugging d=500 nm:

λ = (4*500)/(2m -1) = 2000/(2m -1)

So, for m=1: λ=2000/1=2000 nm

m=2: λ=2000/3≈666.67 nm

m=3: λ=2000/5=400 nm

None of these are in the options except maybe 667, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, the options are 500, 550, 600, 650 nm. So, 667 is closest to 650, but not exactly. Maybe 650 is the answer because it's the closest? But why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the phase shifts. Let me think again.

Wait, the reflection at oil-water: when light reflects off oil-water, it's going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). So, since it's reflecting off a lower refractive index medium, does it undergo a phase shift? No, because phase shift occurs when reflecting off a medium with higher n, not lower.

But wait, the reflection at water's surface: when the light goes through oil, water, and reflects off the water's surface, it's going from water (n=1.33) to air (n=1.0). That's a lower refractive index, so reflection at water's surface has a phase shift of π.

Wait, so in the second reflection (oil-water), the light reflects off oil-water, which is a lower n, so no phase shift. Then, it goes through oil, into water, and reflects off the water's surface (water-air), which is a lower n, so phase shift of π. Then, it comes back through oil.

So, in this case, the second reflected wave undergoes two phase shifts: none at oil-water, and π at water's surface.

Wait, but actually, is that reflection part of the same event? Because the light reflecting off the water's surface is different from the reflection at oil-water.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for thin film interference:

The condition for constructive interference is:

2nd = (m + 1/2)λ

if there is a phase shift of π between the two reflections.

Or,

2nd = mλ

if there is no phase shift.

In this case, we have two reflections:

1. At air-oil: phase shift of π.

2. At oil-water: no phase shift.

But then, the second reflection also involves a reflection at water's surface, which is another phase shift of π.

Wait, maybe we need to consider that the second reflection is actually from the water's surface, which is another interface. So, the reflection at oil-water is part of the second reflection
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about light reflection off a puddle of water with an oil layer on top. I need to figure out which wavelength of light is most strongly reflected. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when light hits a boundary between two different media, some of it reflects and some of it refracts. The reflection depends on the indices of refraction of the two media. The question is about white light, which contains all wavelengths, so I guess I need to consider how each wavelength behaves upon reflection.

There's a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33, and there's a thin layer of oil on top with an index of 1.5. The oil is only 500 nm thick. So, the light first hits the oil, then goes into the water. I need to figure out the reflection that happens at each interface: oil to air and oil to water.

Wait, but the question is about white light normally incident on the puddle. So, the light is coming from air, hitting the oil layer, then into the water. So, the first reflection is at the air-oil interface, and the second reflection is at the oil-water interface. Maybe the question is about the second reflection? Or both?

I think the question is asking about the most strongly reflected wavelength, which might be related to constructive interference. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase change of π (half a wavelength), whereas if it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase change.

So, let's think about each interface:

1. Air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5). Since oil has a higher refractive index, the reflected light undergoes a phase shift of π, which is equivalent to a half-wavelength shift.

2. Oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). Here, oil has a higher refractive index than water, so again, the reflection at this interface also undergoes a phase shift of π.

Wait, but phase shifts happen when reflecting off a denser medium. So, both reflections here are off denser media. So, each reflection causes a phase shift. Hmm.

But for constructive interference, the phase shifts should be considered. If the light reflects off two surfaces, each with a phase shift, the total phase shift is 2*(π) = π, which is equivalent to a full wavelength shift (since 2π is a full cycle). But a full wavelength shift would mean that the waves constructively interfere with themselves, meaning the reflected light is enhanced.

But wait, in thin film interference, when there are two reflections, each causing a phase shift, the total phase shift is 2*λ*(phase shift). Since each reflection gives a phase shift of π, that's equivalent to λ/2 shift each. So two reflections would give a total shift of λ.

Wait, phase difference is important here. So, when light reflects off two surfaces, each with a phase shift, the total phase difference is 2*(λ/2) = λ.

But for constructive interference, the phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π. So, λ is half of that. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in thin film interference, when there are two reflections, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus any phase shifts equals an integer multiple of 2π.

The path difference is 2*nt, where n is the refractive index of the film and t is the thickness.

In this case, the film is oil with n=1.5 and t=500 nm.

So, the path difference is 2*1.5*500 nm = 1500 nm.

But also, each reflection at a higher index medium causes a phase shift of π, so two reflections give a total phase shift of 2π, which is equivalent to 0 phase shift because it's a full cycle.

Therefore, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference equals an integer multiple of 2π*(the wavelength in the medium).

Wait, but the wavelength in the oil is λ0/n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. So, actually, the path difference is 2nt = mλ0/n, where m is an integer.

Therefore, 2*1.5*500 = m*(λ0/1.5)

Simplify:

1500 = m*(λ0/1.5)

Multiply both sides by 1.5:

2250 = m*λ0

So, λ0 = 2250/m

Therefore, the wavelengths in vacuum that satisfy this are λ0 = 2250/m, where m is an integer.

The smallest m is 1, giving λ0 = 2250 nm. But visible light only goes up to about 700 nm, so m=1 is too big because 2250 nm is in the infrared.

What about m=2? 2250/2 = 1125 nm. Still too big for visible light.

m=3: 750 nm, which is in the near-infrared, just beyond visible.

Wait, visible light is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So, 750 nm is infrared, so perhaps we need to look for the next possible m where λ0 is within the visible range.

But wait, since λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum, maybe when we consider the reflection in the oil, the actual wavelength in oil is λ = λ0 / n = λ0 / 1.5.

But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the condition for constructive interference in thin films differently.

For thin film interference, when there are two reflections:

- If both reflections are from higher to lower refractive index, then each reflection causes a phase shift of π, so the total phase shift is 2π (equivalent to 0)
- If one reflection is from higher to lower and the other is from lower to higher, only one phase shift
- If both reflections are from lower to higher, no phase shifts

In this case, both reflections are from higher to lower (air to oil and oil to water), so each reflection has a phase shift of π, so total phase shift is 2π, which is 0. So, we don't have to consider the phase shift for constructive interference; it's like no phase shift.

So, for constructive interference, the path difference has to be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film.

The path difference is 2nt, which is 2*1.5*500 nm = 1500 nm.

So, 1500 nm = m*(λ/n), where λ is the wavelength in vacuum, and n=1.5 is the refractive index of the oil.

So, 1500 = m*(λ/1.5)

Therefore, λ = (1500 * 1.5)/m = 2250/m

So, λ is 2250/m nm.

But in visible light, λ is between 400-700 nm.

Let's see for m=3: λ≈750 nm, which is infrared.

Wait, that's outside visible. Hmm, maybe I made a wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we should be considering the reflection within the oil and the reflection off the water. Maybe that's where the interference happens.

Wait, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, maybe it's considering both reflections.

Wait, another approach: the reflected light consists of two components: the light reflected at the top surface (air-oil) and the light reflected at the oil-water interface after going through the oil.

So, the light that reflects at the top surface is the first reflection, and the second reflection comes after the oil.

The path difference between the two reflected rays is 2nt, where n is the oil's refractive index and t is its thickness. Additionally, if the reflections cause a phase shift, we have to consider that.

At the air-oil interface, reflection happens from lower to higher index, so phase shift of π.

At the oil-water interface, reflection happens from higher to lower index (since oil is 1.5 and water is 1.33, so oil is higher). So, reflection at oil-water interface is from higher to lower, so another π phase shift.

Therefore, both reflected rays have undergone a phase shift of π, so the total phase shift between them is 2π, which is equivalent to 0, so they interfere constructively when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.

Wait, so for constructive interference, the path difference should be mλ, where m is integer.

The path difference is 2nt = 2*1.5*500 = 1500 nm.

So, 1500 nm = mλ.

Therefore, the wavelength λ is 1500/m nm.

We want λ to be in the visible range (400-700 nm).

So, let's see m=2: λ=750 nm (infrared, too big)

m=3: λ=500 nm (visible, green/yellow)

Wait, m=2: 750 nm is infrared, so perhaps m=3 is the first integer where λ is in visible.

But m=3 would mean λ=1500/3=500 nm.

Wait, but 500 nm is one of the options, option A. However, the correct answer is supposed to be D. 650 nm.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the wavelength inside the oil.

Wait, when light reflects off the oil-water interface, it travels through the oil twice (down and up), so the path is 2t long inside the oil. The wavelength in oil is λ/n, so the path difference is 2t = 2*500/1.5 = 1000/1.5 ≈ 666.666 nm.

So, 666.666 nm is the path difference.

But for constructive interference, the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light in oil.

So, 666.666 = m*(λ/1.5)

So, λ = 666.666 * 1.5 / m

Wait, that's not quite right.

Wait, let me think again. The optical path difference is 2nt. The optical path length is the physical path length multiplied by the refractive index. So, for the oil, the path is 2t, so the optical path is 2t*n.

So, the condition for constructive interference is that 2nt = mλ, where λ is the wavelength in vacuum.

So, 2*1.5*500 = 1500 = mλ

So, λ = 1500/m

So, for λ in visible, 400 <= λ <=700.

Let’s compute for m=2: λ=750 nm (infrared)

m=3: λ=500 nm

m=4: λ=375 nm (too low, ultraviolet)

Wait, so the only possible visible λ is 500 nm, which is option A.

But the correct answer is supposed to be D. 650 nm. So, I must have messed something up.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the actual reflected wavelengths from each interface.

Wait, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, so maybe it's considering the interference between the two reflections.

So, when light comes in, first reflection is at air-oil with a phase shift of π, then the transmitted light goes into oil, reflects off oil-water with another phase shift of π, and the two reflections interfere.

But for constructive interference, the path difference plus any phase shifts should result in a phase difference of 2π.

So, the path difference is 2nt, and the phase shifts from reflections give an additional π each, so total phase shift is 2π.

Therefore, the condition for constructive interference is 2nt = mλ, where m is integer.

Therefore, again 2*1.5*500 = 1500 = mλ

So, λ=1500/m

So, in the visible range:

m=2: λ=750 nm (infrared)

m=3: λ=500 nm (visible)

m=4: λ=375 nm (UV)

Hmm, so only λ=500 nm is in the visible. So, why is the correct answer 650 nm?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is about the reflected light from the oil-water interface only, not considering the first reflection.

Wait, the question says "the most strongly reflected wavelength." So, perhaps it's considering the second reflection, where the light goes through oil and reflects off water.

But the light reflecting off water would have a different phase.

Wait, reflection at oil-water: oil has higher refractive index than water, so reflection here causes a phase shift of π.

Similarly, reflection at air-oil causes a phase shift of π.

So, the two reflected rays (first and second) have each undergone a phase shift of π, so the total phase shift between them is 2π, meaning they are in phase.

Therefore, the light reflecting off oil-water is in phase with the first reflection, so they add constructively, enhancing the reflected light.

But wait, the path difference is 2nt, as before.

Wait, so the condition is that 2nt = mλ.

So, 1500 = mλ

So, λ=1500/m

Looking for λ in visible, m=3 gives 500 nm, which is option A.

But the correct answer is 650 nm, which is option D.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm not considering the fact that the light reflects off the water, and water has a different refractive index.

Wait, when the light reflects off the water, it's going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). So, oil is higher, so reflection here causes a phase shift of π.

But the first reflection is from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5), so phase shift of π as well.

Therefore, both reflected rays (first and second) have a phase shift of π, so total phase shift is 2π, which is same as 0.

Therefore, they can interfere constructively.

So, again, 2nt = mλ.

So, m = 1500/λ.

We have to find the wavelength λ that causes constructive interference.

But λ must be such that m is integer.

Wait, but in the options, we have 500, 550, 600, 650.

So, maybe the correct approach is to think in terms of the oil's thickness and the wavelength.

Wait, another thought: the oil layer is 500 nm, so for constructive interference, 2t = mλ/n, where n is the refractive index.

So, 2*500 = mλ/1.5

So, 1000 = mλ/1.5

Thus, λ = 1500/m

So, for m=2: λ=750 nm

m=3: λ=500 nm

m=4: λ=375 nm

So, again, only 500 nm is in the visible.

But 500 nm is option A, but the correct answer is D. 650 nm.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the reflection in the air-oil interface and the transmission through the oil and reflection in the oil-water interface.

So, there are two reflections: one at the top (air-oil), and one at the oil-water.

But for each reflection, we have to consider phase shifts.

First reflection: air to oil, phase shift of π.

Second reflection: oil to water, phase shift of π.

So, both reflections have a phase shift, so total phase shift is 2π.

But for the light that goes through the oil and reflects off water, the path it travels is 2t in oil.

So, the path difference is 2t, which is 1000 nm.

But the wavelength in oil is λ/n, so the path difference is 2t = 2t*(n/λ) = (2tn)/λ.

Wait, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus the phase shifts equals 2π.

So, in this case, the path difference is 2t = 1000 nm.

But also, the wavelength in oil is λ/n, so the number of wavelengths in the path is 2t / (λ/n) = 2tn/λ

But for constructive interference, 2tn/λ must be integer.

Wait, because each wavelength corresponds to 2π phase, so if the path difference is integer number of wavelengths, the phase difference is 2π*integer, which is 0, and they add constructively.

Therefore, 2tn/λ = m, where m is integer.

So, 2*1.5*500 / λ = m

So, 1500 / λ = m

So, λ = 1500/m

Which brings me back to the same equation.

Therefore, for λ=1500/m to be in visible, we need 400 <= λ <=700.

So, m=2: λ=750 (infrared)

m=3: λ=500 (visible)

m=4: λ=375 (UV)

So, only 500 nm is in the visible, which is option A.

But the correct answer is 650 nm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the phase shifts. If the first reflection is at air-oil, which causes a phase shift of π, and the second reflection is at oil-water, which also causes a phase shift of π, so total phase shift is 2π.

Therefore, the two reflected rays are in phase if the path difference is mλ, but if they are in phase, they add constructively.

Wait, but if the path difference is mλ, then the phase difference is 2πm, which is same as 0, so constructive.

But in this case, the path difference is 2t, which is 1000 nm.

Wait, but 1000 nm is the path difference. So, for constructive interference, this 1000 nm should be equal to mλ.

But λ is the wavelength in vacuum.

So, 1000 = mλ

Thus, λ=1000/m

So, visible range λ=400-700.

So, m=2: λ=500 nm

m=1: λ=1000 nm (infrared)

Wait, so again, only λ=500 nm is in the visible.

But the correct answer is 650 nm, so I must be making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the light is reflecting off the oil-water interface, so the path difference is 2t, but considering oil's refractive
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection on a puddle of water with a thin oil layer on top. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected. It gives me four options: 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm. The correct answer is supposed to be D, 650 nm, but I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me try to visualize the setup. There's a puddle of water, which has a higher refractive index than oil. The oil layer is thin, only 500 nm thick, and it's floating on top of the water. Now, when light hits this oil layer, part of it reflects off the top surface of the oil. Another part goes through the oil and reflects off the water surface beneath. Since the oil has a higher refractive index than water, there might be some interference happening here.

Wait, actually, hold on. The oil's refractive index is 1.5, and water's is 1.33. So oil is denser than water? Hmm, that's a bit counterintuitive because usually, oil and water don't mix, but oil is less dense. Maybe I'm confusing something. Wait, no, the refractive index doesn't directly correlate to density, but it does affect how light refracts.

So, when white light hits the oil layer, some reflects off the oil-water interface. The rest goes through the oil, reflects off the water, and then comes back through the oil to the air. These two reflected waves (from the top and bottom surfaces) will interfere with each other. Since the light is white, it contains all wavelengths, but the problem is about which specific wavelength is most strongly reflected.

I remember something about thin film interference. The condition for constructive interference depends on the thickness of the film and the refractive indices of the materials involved. The formula for the wavelength inside the film is λ = λ₀ / n, where λ₀ is the wavelength in vacuum and n is the refractive index. But here, we're dealing with reflected light, so the phase shift also matters.

Let me think step by step.

1. **Identify the interfaces:**
   - Air (n ≈ 1) to oil (n = 1.5).
   - Oil (n = 1.5) to water (n = 1.33).
   
2. **Determine which reflection causes a phase change:**
   - When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π (or 180 degrees). If it reflects off a medium with lower refractive index, there's no phase shift.
   
   - So, at the air-oil interface, light reflects from higher to lower (1 to 1.5 is higher), so no phase shift.
   - At the oil-water interface, light goes from oil (1.5) to water (1.33), which is lower. So reflection here is from a higher to lower index, so again, no phase shift? Wait, no, wait. No, when light reflects off a medium with lower refractive index, it doesn't undergo a phase shift. So both reflections (air-oil and oil-water) are from higher to lower? Wait, no. Wait, air has n=1, oil has n=1.5, so when light goes from air to oil, it's entering a medium with higher n, so reflection causes phase shift of π. But when it goes from oil to water, oil has higher n (1.5) than water (1.33), so when light reflects off water, it's going from higher to lower n, so no phase shift.

Wait, maybe I messed that up.

Wait, the rule is: if the light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift. So, at air-oil interface, light is going from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5). So reflection occurs at the interface where n increases, which causes a phase shift of π.

At the oil-water interface, light goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). So reflection occurs at the interface where n decreases. So no phase shift for that reflection.

So, the two reflected waves: one from air-oil (phase shift π), and one from oil-water (no phase shift). So when these two waves interfere, the phase difference due to the path length plus any additional phase shifts will determine if they constructively or destructively interfere.

But wait, for reflected light, the first reflection (air-oil) has a phase shift of π, while the second reflection (oil-water) has no phase shift. So the phase difference between the two reflected waves is π plus the phase difference due to the path length.

Let me write that down:

- Phase shift from reflection: π (for air-oil) - 0 (for oil-water) = π.
- Phase shift due to path length: The wave that goes through the oil has to travel an extra distance twice the thickness of the oil layer (once down and once up). So the path length is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil.

The wavelength in the oil is λ₀ / n_oil, where n_oil is 1.5. So the phase difference from the path length is (2π / λ₀) * (2t / n_oil).

Wait, is that right? The phase change per unit length in the medium is 2π / λ_medium. So the total phase change is 2π * (2t) / λ_medium.

Yes, so phase difference from path length is (4π t) / (λ₀ / n_oil) ) = (4π t n_oil) / λ₀.

Therefore, the total phase difference between the two reflected waves is π (from reflection) plus (4π t n_oil)/λ₀.

For constructive interference, this total phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π. So:

π + (4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2π m, where m is integer.

Divide both sides by π:

1 + (4 t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2m.

Let me solve for λ₀:

(4 t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2m - 1

λ₀ = (4 t n_oil)/(2m - 1)

But wait, λ₀ is the vacuum wavelength. However, in the problem, the options are given in nanometers, so I think we need to find which wavelength (in vacuum) would satisfy the condition for constructive interference.

Wait, but the question is about the reflected wavelength. Hmm, so maybe I need to think about the wavelengths of the reflected waves.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the condition for constructive interference is when the round trip phase shift is an integer multiple of 2π. So, the extra path length is 2t, and the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ₀ / n_oil.

So, the phase difference due to path length is (2π / λ_oil) * 2t = (2π * 2t)/λ_oil = (4π t)/λ₀ / n_oil.

Wait, same as before. So, total phase difference is π (from reflection) + (4π t)/(λ₀ n_oil).

For constructive interference, this must equal 2π m.

So:

π + (4π t)/(λ₀ n_oil) = 2π m

Divide both sides by π:

1 + (4 t)/(λ₀ n_oil) = 2m

Rearrange:

(4 t)/(λ₀ n_oil) = 2m - 1

So,

λ₀ = (4 t n_oil)/(2m - 1)

So, the wavelength in vacuum that causes constructive interference is λ₀ = (4 t n_oil)/(2m - 1)

Given that t is 500 nm, n_oil is 1.5. Let's plug in the numbers:

λ₀ = (4 * 500 nm * 1.5) / (2m - 1) = (3000 nm) / (2m - 1)

We need λ₀ to be a positive value, so 2m - 1 must be a positive integer. So m is integer ≥1, so 2m -1 ≥1.

So for m=1: λ₀ = 3000 /1 = 3000 nm (which is in infrared, not visible)
m=2: 3000 /3 ≈1000 nm (near infrared)
m=3: 3000 /5=600 nm (visible)
m=4: 3000 /7≈428 nm (visible)
m=5: 3000 /9≈333 nm
m=6: 3000 /11≈272 nm
m=7: 3000 /13≈230 nm
m=8: 3000 /15=200 nm
m=9: 3000 /17≈176 nm
m=10:3000/19≈157 nm

Wait, so the visible wavelengths are from m=3 (600 nm) down to m=4 (428 nm). So 600 nm is in the orange-red region, 428 is in blue-green.

But the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, which of the given options (500,550,600,650) falls into the 600 or lower nm for constructive interference.

Looking at the options, 600 nm is an option, but 650 is also there.

Wait, but hold on, is this the condition for constructive interference or destructive?

Wait, let me double-check. When light reflects off two surfaces, if both have phase shifts, or both don't, then the interference can be constructive or destructive. But in this case, one reflection has a phase shift (air-oil) and the other doesn't (oil-water). So the net phase difference is π plus the path difference phase.

So, when is this total phase difference equal to 2π m (constructive) or 2π m + π (destructive).

Wait, I think the formula is:

Total phase difference = phase from reflection + phase from path.

In this case, reflection gives π, and path gives (4π t n_oil)/λ₀.

So, for constructive interference, total phase difference should be 2π m:

π + (4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2π m

Which gives:

(4 t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2m -1

Thus, λ₀ = (4 t n_oil)/(2m -1)

So, given that, the wavelengths that satisfy this equation are λ₀ as above.

But the question is asking for the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, which wavelength among the options is closest to one of these constructive interference wavelengths.

Given that, the possible λ₀ values are 3000, 1000, 600, 428, etc. So 600 nm is one of them. So 600 nm is a wavelength that would experience constructive interference, hence more reflected.

But wait, 650 nm is not one of those. So why is 650 nm the correct answer? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the condition wrong. Maybe it's destructive interference?

Wait, no, because the question is about the most strongly reflected. So if it's constructively interfering, then more light would reflect, meaning more reflection. So higher reflection.

Wait, but if the phase difference is π, that would be destructive interference, right? Because π is half a wavelength, so destructive.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Let me think again.

When light reflects off two surfaces, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus the phase shift equals an integer multiple of 2π.

In this case, the path difference is 2t, but in the oil, so the wavelength is λ_oil = λ₀ / n_oil.

So the path difference in terms of wavelength is 2t / (λ₀ / n_oil) ) = (2t n_oil)/λ₀.

Additionally, one reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift of π, while the other reflection (oil-water) does not. So the total phase shift is π plus the phase shift from path difference.

The phase shift from path difference is (2π / λ_oil) * (2t) = (4π t)/λ₀.

Wait, no, because λ_oil = λ₀ / n_oil, so 2t / λ_oil = 2t n_oil / λ₀.

Thus, phase shift from path is (2π)(2t n_oil)/λ₀ = (4π t n_oil)/λ₀.

So, total phase shift is π + (4π t n_oil)/λ₀.

For constructive interference, this total phase shift should be equal to 2π m, where m is integer.

So:

π + (4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2π m

Subtract π:

(4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2π m - π = π(2m -1)

Divide both sides by π:

(4 t n_oil)/λ₀ = 2m -1

Thus, λ₀ = (4 t n_oil)/(2m -1)

Which is what I had before.

So, λ₀ is 3000/(2m -1). So, for m=3, λ₀=600nm.

So, 600nm is a wavelength that leads to constructive interference, meaning more reflection. So 600 nm is one of the options. But the answer is 650 nm. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the oil layer reflecting the light, but since oil has a higher refractive index than water, the reflection at the oil-water interface is less, so maybe the primary reflection is at the oil surface. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, the two reflected waves are: one from the oil surface, which is from higher to lower (air to oil), so reflection at oil surface is strong (because it's from higher to lower n, so reflection is not phase-shifted? Wait, no, reflection at higher n gives phase shift.

Wait, no, reflection from a medium with higher n causes a phase shift.

So, when light reflects off the oil surface, going from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5), so higher n, so reflection has a phase shift of π.

When light goes through the oil, reflects off the water, which has lower n (1.33), so reflection is from higher to lower, so no phase shift.

So, the two reflected waves: the first one (air-oil) has a phase shift of π, the second one (oil-water) has no phase shift.

Now, the path length difference is 2t, where t is 500 nm. The wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ₀ / n_oil = λ₀ /1.5.

So, the path difference is 2t = 1000 nm.

In terms of wavelengths, that is 1000 / (λ₀ /1.5) ) = (1500)/λ₀ wavelengths.

Each wavelength corresponds to 2π phase shift. So, phase shift due to path is (1500 / λ₀ ) * 2π.

Plus the phase shift from reflection is π.

Total phase difference: π + (3000 / λ₀ ) π.

Because (1500 / λ₀ ) * 2π is equal to (3000 / λ₀ ) π.

So, Total phase difference = π + (3000 π)/λ₀.

We want constructive interference, so total phase difference should be multiple of 2π.

So,

π + (3000 π)/λ₀ = 2π m

Divide both sides by π:

1 + 3000 / λ₀ = 2m

So,

3000 / λ₀ = 2m -1

Thus,

λ₀ = 3000 / (2m -1 )

Same as before.

So, possible λ₀ values:

m=1: 3000 nm (infrared)
m=2: 1500 nm (infrared)
m=3: 1000 nm (near infrared)
m=4: 750 nm (near infrared, just below visible red)
m=5: 600 nm (red light)
m=6: 500 nm (green light)
m=7: 428 nm (blue-violet)
m=8: 375 nm (UV)
m=9: 333 nm (UV)
...

So, for m=5, λ₀=600 nm
For m=6, λ₀=500 nm

So, the problem is giving options: 500, 550, 600, 650.

So, 600 is an option, so if λ₀=600 nm, that's constructively interfering.

But the correct answer is 650 nm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, another perspective: the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, we need to find the wavelength where the two reflections interfere constructively, causing more reflection.

But the oil layer is thin, so the effective thickness is 500 nm.

But wait, is the formula different when dealing with reflected light?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the reflected light from the oil-water interface, which is less dense, so it might reflect more? Hmm, but oil has higher n than water, so oil-water interface is from higher to lower, so reflection is less, but with phase shift?

Wait, but the reflection at oil-water interface is weaker because it's going to a lower n, so reflected light is weaker.

Whereas the reflection at air-oil interface is stronger because it's going to higher n.

So, perhaps the dominant reflection is from air-oil, unless there is constructive interference from the oil-water reflection.

But since the oil-water reflection is weaker, the total reflection is a combination of both.

Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about Brewster's angle or something else, but no, it's about thin film interference.

Wait, maybe instead of constructive interference, it's considering destructive interference. Because if the phase difference is π, then destructive.

Wait, let's see: if the total phase difference is π, then it's destructive.

So, set total phase difference = π.

So,

π + (4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = π

Which would imply:

(4π t n_oil)/λ₀ = 0

Which is impossible, so not destructive.

Alternatively, if the phase difference is π, it's destructive.

Wait,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and wavelengths. Let me try to understand what's going on.

Okay, the question says that white light is normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an index of refraction of 1.33. On top of this puddle, there's a thin layer of oil with a refractive index of 1.5. The thickness of this oil layer is 500 nanometers. The question is asking which wavelength of light is most strongly reflected, and the options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm. The correct answer is supposedly 650 nm, but I need to figure out why.

First, I remember that when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees, which effectively causes destructive interference. Conversely, when light reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift. So, if the reflection happens twice—once from the top surface and once from the bottom surface—it can lead to constructive or destructive interference depending on the path difference and phase shifts.

In this problem, we have three interfaces: air to oil, oil to water, and water to oil. Wait, actually, hold on. Since the oil is on top of the water, the light first hits the oil, then the water, and then the oil's bottom surface is actually in contact with the water. Hmm, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the oil is floating on the water, so the order of the layers is air (or oil), oil, water. No, actually, when light comes from above, it first hits the oil, then the water. So the reflection happens at the oil's surface (air-oil interface) and then again at the water's surface (oil-water interface). The light can also refract into the oil and then reflect off the water's surface from below.

Wait, maybe I need to visualize this. So, the setup is oil on top of water. The light comes from above, from the air, first hitting the oil. So two possible reflection points: air-oil interface and oil-water interface. Additionally, some light can enter the oil, reflect off the water, and then come back out. So that's the two reflection points and one transmission through the oil.

So, the light beam that reflects off the oil's surface (air-oil) and the one that goes through the oil, reflects off the water's surface, and then comes back out will interfere with each other.

This is similar to the famous soap bubble problem, where interference happens due to reflections at different interfaces.

I think this is a case of thin film interference. The condition for constructive interference is that the path difference plus any phase shifts should result in a whole number of wavelengths. For destructive interference, it's half a wavelength.

So, to calculate the path difference, we need to consider the thickness of the oil layer, the indices of refraction of the involved media, and the order of the interference.

Let me recall the formula for path difference. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift. If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, no phase shift occurs.

So, in this case, the first reflection is at the air-oil interface. Since oil has a higher refractive index than air (1.5 > 1), this reflection will have a phase shift of 180 degrees.

Then, the light that enters the oil layer, travels through it, reflects off the oil-water interface. Now, oil has a lower refractive index than water (1.5 < 1.33? Wait, hold on. Wait, no: 1.5 is higher than 1.33? Wait, 1.5 is about 1.5, and 1.33 is approximately 1.33. So oil (1.5) is higher than water (1.33), right? Because oil has a higher refractive index than water. So, when light reflects off the oil-water interface, it goes from a lower refractive index (oil) to a higher refractive index (water), so that reflection will also have a 180-degree phase shift.

Wait, wait, hold on. I think I confused something. Let me double-check. The problem says oil is floating on water. So oil is on top, so the layers are air, oil, water. So, the light first hits the oil, then the water.

So, when light reflects off the oil (air-oil interface), oil has a higher refractive index than air, so phase shift of 180 degrees.

Then, the light that enters the oil, goes through it, and reflects off the oil-water interface. At this point, oil has a lower refractive index than water (since oil is 1.5, water is 1.33). So, reflecting off a lower to higher refractive index, which means a phase shift of 180 degrees.

So, each reflection in this scenario undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees. So, both reflections (air-oil and oil-water) cause a phase shift. So, in total, they have each caused a 180-degree shift.

Additionally, the light that goes through the oil and reflects off the water has to travel an additional distance equal to twice the thickness of the oil layer (since it goes down and then comes back up). So, the path difference is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil.

But wait, in thin film interference, the path difference is 2nt, where n is the refractive index of the film. So, in this case, the oil has a refractive index of 1.5, so the path difference is 2 * 1.5 * t, which is 3t.

So, the total phase shift comes from the reflections and the path difference. Each reflection gives a 180-degree shift, so two reflections give a total of 360 degrees, which is equivalent to zero degrees because 360 is a full rotation.

But we also have a path difference of 3t, which is a physical path difference in addition to the phase shifts.

So, the condition for constructive interference is when the total path difference (including phase shifts) is an integer multiple of the wavelength.

But wait, the phase shifts from reflections are already taken into account as they contribute to the phase difference.

So, the formula for constructive interference is 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ, where m is 0, 1, 2, ... (for one phase inversion) or 2nt = mλ for zero phase inversions.

But in our case, both reflections cause a phase shift, so each reflection contributes a 180-degree shift, totaling 360 degrees, which is like no net phase shift. So, the two reflections don't add any extra phase shift beyond what is caused by the path difference.

So, considering that, the condition for constructive interference is 2nt = mλ, where m is an integer.

Similarly, for destructive interference, the condition would be 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ.

But wait, no, actually, the total phase shift from reflections is 2 * 180 = 360 degrees, which is like 0 degrees because it's a full rotation. So, it's equivalent to no phase shift.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of phase differences. When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it's a phase shift of 180 degrees. If it reflects off a lower refractive index, no phase shift.

So, at the air-oil interface, reflection occurs from higher to lower? Wait, no: oil has higher refractive index than air, so reflection at air-oil interface is from lower to higher, which is 180 degrees.

Wait, hold on, let me clarify this:

Wait, when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift. So, air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5): reflection is from lower to higher, so phase shift of 180 degrees.

Then, the transmitted light goes into oil, travels down, and at oil-water interface, oil has lower refractive index than water (since n_water=1.33, n_oil=1.5). So, at oil-water interface, reflecting from lower to higher: another 180-degree phase shift.

So, both reflections cause 180 degrees each, so total phase shift from reflections is 360 degrees, which is equivalent to 0 degrees because 360 is a full circle, so no net phase shift.

Then, the path difference is 2 * n_oil * t. So, 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = 1500 nm.

So, the path difference is 1500 nm. But we need to compare this to the wavelength of light in the medium, right?

Wait, no, the path difference is 2nt, and we compare this to the wavelength in vacuum or in the medium?

Wait, actually, the condition for constructive or destructive interference is based on the path difference relative to the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I should think in terms of the optical path, which is the physical path length multiplied by the refractive index.

So, the light goes through the oil layer of thickness t, so the physical path length is t. Then, the optical path is n_oil * t.

But in this case, when the light reflects off the water, it goes back up through the oil, so the total path is 2t, and the optical path is 2 * n_oil * t.

So, the optical path difference (OPD) is 2 * n_oil * t.

The OPD needs to be compared to the wavelength of light in the medium.

Wait, but the light that's reflecting off the oil-water interface has already gone through the oil, so the wavelength in the oil is shorter than in vacuum.

The wavelength in the oil is λ_oil = λ_vacuum / n_oil.

So, when calculating the condition for constructive or destructive interference, it's based on the ratio of OPD to the wavelength in the medium.

So, the condition for constructive interference is OPD = mλ_oil, where m is an integer.

Similarly, destructive interference is OPD = (m + 1/2)λ_oil.

But considering the phase shifts, which in this case, both reflections caused a phase shift of 180 degrees each, so the net phase shift is 360, which is equivalent to 0, so no additional phase shift.

Therefore, the condition is OPD = mλ_oil for constructive interference and OPD = (m + 1/2)λ_oil for destructive.

So, let me compute OPD:

OPD = 2 * n_oil * t = 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = 1500 nm.

Now, let's find the wavelength of the light in the oil:

λ_oil = λ_vacuum / n_oil.

But we don't know the wavelength in vacuum. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, but we can relate the wavelength in vacuum to the options given. Let's see, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, so the wavelength that causes constructive interference, which means OPD is integer multiple of λ_oil.

So, let's denote the wavelength in vacuum as λ, then in oil it's λ / n_oil.

But we don't know λ, but perhaps we can relate this to the options.

Wait, perhaps the light in question is white light, which contains all wavelengths, but the question is about the wavelength that is most strongly reflected, meaning the wavelength that causes constructive interference. So, we need to find the wavelength λ such that OPD = mλ_oil.

So, OPD = 2 * n_oil * t = m * (λ / n_oil).

So, 2 * 1.5 * 500 = m * (λ / 1.5).

Calculating the left side: 2 * 1.5 = 3, so 3 * 500 = 1500 nm.

So, 1500 = m * (λ / 1.5).

Then, solve for λ:

λ = (1500 * 1.5) / m = 2250 / m nm.

So, λ must be equal to 2250 / m for some integer m. Since λ has to be in the visible range, which is approximately 400 nm to 700 nm.

So, let's compute 2250 / m for m = 1,2,3,...

For m=1: λ=2250 nm, which is way beyond visible range.

For m=2: λ=1125 nm, still beyond.

m=3: λ=750 nm, which is near the upper end of visible light (red light is around 620-750 nm).

m=4: λ=562.5 nm, which is in green.

m=5: λ=450 nm, which is blue.

Wait, but the options given are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 650 nm. So, none of these are exactly matching 2250/m for integer m.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it another way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total phase shift.

Wait, the OPD is 2nt = 1500 nm.

But the condition for constructive interference is when the OPD is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium, considering any phase shifts.

Wait, but what is the relationship between the OPD and the wavelength?

Wait, another approach: the path difference between the two reflected rays (the one reflected at air-oil and the one that goes through oil and reflects at oil-water) is 2nt.

Additionally, we have to consider the phase shift from reflections.

Each reflection at a higher refractive index interface causes a phase shift of 180 degrees.

So, first reflection: air-oil, phase shift of 180 degrees.

Second reflection: oil-water, also a phase shift of 180 degrees.

So, total phase shift from reflections: 180 + 180 = 360 degrees, which is the same as 0 degrees.

Therefore, the net phase shift from reflections is 0.

Thus, the total phase difference comes only from the path difference.

So, for constructive interference, the path difference (which is 2nt) should be equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength in vacuum. Wait, or in oil?

Wait, the path difference is in oil, so the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ_vacuum / n_oil.

So, the condition is 2nt = mλ_oil, where m is integer.

So, 2 * 1.5 * 500 = m * (λ / 1.5).

So, 1500 = m * (λ / 1.5).

Rearranged: λ = (1500 * 1.5) / m = 2250 / m.

Same result as before.

Hmm, so if λ = 2250 / m, and m must be an integer. So, for m=3, λ=750 nm; m=4, 562.5 nm; m=5, 450 nm.

But none of these exactly match the options given.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the fact that when the phase shift is zero, the condition is 2nt = mλ, but when the phase shift is 180 degrees, the condition is 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ.

Wait, in this case, the net phase shift from reflections is zero, so it's as if there is no phase shift. So, it's 2nt = mλ.

Alternatively, if the net phase shift was π (180 degrees), then it would be 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ.

But here, since both reflections added a phase shift of 180 degrees, which is equivalent to no phase shift, as 360 is a full rotation.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it: when the reflections are both 180, the net phase shift is 0, so the condition is 2nt = mλ.

So, 2 * 1.5 * 500 = mλ.

So, 1500 = mλ.

So, λ = 1500 / m.

Now, looking at the options: 500, 550, 600, 650.

Wait, 1500 / m must be equal to one of these, so m = 1500 / λ.

So, m must be an integer such that λ is in the visible range.

Let's test the options:

A. 500 nm: m = 1500 / 500 = 3. So, m=3.

B. 550 nm: m=1500 / 550 ≈2.727, not integer.

C. 600 nm: m=1500 /600=2.5, not integer.

D.650 nm: m=1500 /650≈2.307, not integer.

Hmm, none of the options are integers. So, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to consider the phase shift in another way. Wait, when light reflects off the top surface (air-oil), it's phase shifted by 180 degrees. Then, the light that goes through and reflects off the oil-water interface is also phase shifted by 180 degrees. So, the two reflected waves have each undergone a phase shift of 180, so the total phase difference between them is 180 + 180 = 360 degrees, which is like 0 degrees.

So, the path difference is 2nt, and the phase difference from reflections is 0. So, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, but is that in the medium or in vacuum?

I think it's in the medium because the path is through the oil.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 2nt = mλ_medium, where λ_medium = λ_vacuum / n.

So, if we denote λ_vacuum as λ, then λ_medium = λ / n_oil.

So, 2nt = m*(λ / n_oil).

So, substituting n=1.5, t=500 nm:

2*1.5*500 = m*(λ /1.5).

Which is 1500 = (mλ)/1.5.

So, λ = (1500 *1.5)/m = 2250/m nm.

Again, same result.

But 2250/m must be equal to one of the options: 500,550,600,650.

So, 2250/m
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that white light is normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an index of refraction of 1.33. There's a thin layer of oil on top of the water, 500 nm thick, with an index of refraction of 1.5. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected, and the options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, or 650 nm. The answer is supposed to be 650 nm, but I need to understand why.

Hmm, okay. So this sounds like it's related to interference, specifically thin-film interference. When light hits a thin film, some of it reflects off the top surface, and some goes through, reflects off the bottom surface, and then exits back. These two reflected waves can interfere with each other, causing constructive or destructive interference.

Since the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, that means we're looking for constructive interference. That occurs when the path difference between the two reflected waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength. So, let's break it down.

First, let's consider the indices of refraction. The oil has a higher index of refraction than the water (1.5 vs. 1.33). When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, the reflected wave undergoes a phase shift of π (which is equivalent to half a wavelength). Conversely, when it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift. So, in this case, the first reflection (from the oil-water interface) will have a phase shift, and the second reflection (from the water-oil interface going back) will not.

Wait, hold on. The light first hits the oil layer. So, the first reflection is at the oil-water interface. Since oil has a higher refractive index than water, the reflection here will cause a phase shift of π. Then, some light goes through the oil, reflects off the water surface. Now, when it reflects off the water, since water has a lower refractive index than oil, does that cause a phase shift?

Wait, no. When reflecting off a medium with a lower index, there's no phase shift. So the reflection from the water-oil interface does not cause a phase shift. Hmm, so that's different. So, the first reflection (oil-water) has a phase shift, and the second reflection (water-oil) does not. So, the two reflected waves will have a phase difference due to the path traveled inside the oil and the different phase shifts.

Let me try to visualize it:

1. Incident light hits the oil layer.
2. Part reflects off the oil-water interface (call this reflection R1).
3. Part transmits through the oil, reflects off the water.
4. Then, this reflected light (reflection R2) goes back through the oil and exits.

So, the path length for the light that goes through the oil is twice the thickness of the oil layer (2 * 500 nm). Since the wavelength in oil is different from the wavelength in air, we need to calculate the actual path difference in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, so the wavelength in the oil is shorter than in air, because the index of refraction is higher. The wavelength in a medium is given by λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. So, in oil, the wavelength is λ0 / 1.5.

Therefore, the path difference (2 * 500 nm) is equal to 2 * (500 nm) * (1.5 / 1) because the oil's wavelength is shorter. Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it.

Actually, the path length in the oil is 2 * 500 nm, but in terms of the wavelength in oil, it's (2 * 500 nm) / (λ_oil) * λ_oil. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the phase difference caused by the path difference.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the phase change. So, when the light goes through the oil, it travels a distance of 2t (where t is 500 nm). The number of wavelengths this corresponds to in the oil is (2t) / λ_oil. Since λ_oil = λ0 / n_oil, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength, we can write this as (2t) * n_oil / λ0.

Similarly, the two reflections cause different phase shifts. R1 reflects off oil-water (higher index) so phase shift of π. R2 reflects off water-oil (lower index) so no phase shift. Therefore, the total phase shift between R1 and R2 is π from the reflection at oil-water, plus a phase shift from the path difference.

Wait, but the path difference is a physical distance, which translates to a phase difference. Since each wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 2π, the number of wavelengths traversed in the oil corresponds to the phase difference. So, if the path is 2t, the phase difference is (2t / λ_oil) * 2π.

But since the oil's wavelength is λ_oil = λ0 / n_oil, then (2t) / (λ0 / n_oil) ) = (2t * n_oil) / λ0.

Therefore, the phase difference from the path is (2 * t * n_oil / λ0) * 2π.

But wait, hold on. I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's think step by step.

1. When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. So, R1 (reflection from oil-water) has a phase shift of π.

2. R2 (reflection from water-oil) reflects off a medium with lower refractive index, so no phase shift.

3. The light going into the oil travels a distance of 2t, which is 1000 nm.

4. This distance corresponds to how many wavelengths in the oil? Since the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ0 / n_oil.

So, the number of wavelengths is (2t) / λ_oil = (1000 nm) / (λ0 / 1.5) ) = (1000 * 1.5 / λ0 ) = 1500 / λ0.

Each wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 2π, so the total phase difference from the path is (1500 / λ0) * 2π.

But we also have the phase shift from the reflection. R1 has a phase shift of π, and R2 does not. So the total phase difference between R1 and R2 is:

Phase difference = (phase difference from path) + (phase difference from reflections)

Which is (1500 / λ0) * 2π + π - 0.

Wait, but actually, when R1 reflects, it has a phase shift of π, but R2 reflects off a medium with a lower index, so no phase shift. So the relative phase shift between R1 and R2 is the phase shift from the path plus the phase shift from R1.

But actually, in interference, we have to consider the total phase difference between the two reflected waves. So R1 has undergone a phase shift of π, and R2 has not. Additionally, R2 has traveled an extra path of 2t inside the oil, which will cause a phase difference based on the number of wavelengths that path corresponds to.

So, to have constructive interference, the total phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π. So:

Phase difference = (path difference in oil / wavelength in oil) * 2π + phase shift due to reflections.

But wait, path difference is 2t, which is 1000 nm, and wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ0 / 1.5.

So, the path difference in terms of wavelengths is (2t) / λ_oil = (1000 / (λ0 / 1.5)) ) = (1500 / λ0).

Each wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 2π, so the phase difference from the path is (1500 / λ0) * 2π.

Additionally, R1 has a phase shift of π, and R2 has no phase shift. So the total phase difference between R1 and R2 is:

Phase difference = (1500 / λ0) * 2π + π.

We want this total phase difference to be an integer multiple of 2π for constructive interference. So:

(1500 / λ0) * 2π + π = 2π * m, where m is an integer.

Let's simplify this equation.

Divide both sides by π:

(1500 / λ0) * 2 + 1 = 2m

Which simplifies to:

(3000 / λ0) + 1 = 2m

So, 3000 / λ0 = 2m - 1

Which implies:

λ0 = 3000 / (2m - 1)

So, the wavelength in vacuum λ0 is equal to 3000 divided by an odd integer.

Wait, so that equation gives us possible values for λ0. Since we're dealing with white light, which has a range of wavelengths, but the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. That suggests that there is a specific wavelength for which the phase difference is exactly an integer multiple of 2π, making constructive interference.

But wait, in this case, the equation is 3000 / λ0 = 2m -1, so λ0 = 3000 / (2m -1). So, for m=1, λ0=3000 nm. For m=2, λ0=1500 nm. For m=3, λ0=1000 nm. For m=4, λ0=750 nm. For m=5, λ0=600 nm. For m=6, λ0=500 nm. For m=7, λ0≈428 nm. Wait, but considering visible light, which is approximately 400-700 nm.

So, in the visible range, we have possible λ0 values at 600 nm, 550 nm, 500 nm, 750 nm is beyond visible.

Wait, but 750 nm is infrared, which is outside the visible spectrum. So, the possible constructive interference wavelengths in the visible range would be 600 nm, 550 nm, 500 nm. Wait, but 550 nm and 500 nm are in the visible range as well.

But hold on, let's see:

Wait, let me plug m=5: λ0=3000/(2*5 -1)=3000/9≈333.33 nm, which is UV.

m=4: 3000/(8-1)=3000/7≈428.57 nm, which is still UV.

m=3: 3000/5=600 nm, visible.

m=2: 3000/3=1000 nm, IR.

m=1: 3000/1=3000 nm, IR.

Wait, so in the visible range, m=3 gives λ0=600 nm, m=4 gives λ0≈428.57 nm, which is UV, and m=5 gives λ0≈333 nm, also UV.

Wait, so in the visible range, the only possible λ0 is 600 nm.

But hold on, the problem says "the most strongly reflected wavelength." So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's another condition here. When light reflects off a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift, but in thin-film interference, sometimes the top reflection can have a phase shift and the bottom reflection can have another, so their combination can lead to either constructive or destructive interference.

Wait, let me recall the formula for thin-film interference. The condition for constructive interference is:

2n t cosθ = (m - 1/2) λ

But in this case, θ is 0, since light is normally incident (θ=0).

But wait, that's for the case where one reflection causes a phase shift and the other doesn't.

Wait, maybe I should recall the condition for constructive interference in thin films.

If the light reflects off two surfaces, and if one reflection causes a phase shift and the other doesn't, the condition for constructive interference is:

2nt = (m + 1/2) λ

Wait, is that right?

Wait, no, another source I recall says that when there is a phase change of π upon reflection at one surface and not the other, the condition for constructive interference is 2nt = (m - 1/2) λ. Hmm, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's refer to the general thin-film interference formula.

When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. So if, for example, the first reflection is from a higher index to a lower index, there's no phase shift. If it's from a lower to higher, there's a phase shift.

In this problem, the oil (n=1.5) is on water (n=1.33). So, light first hits oil, which has a higher refractive index than water. So, reflection at oil-water interface (first reflection) is from higher to lower, so no phase shift? Wait, hold on: when light goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), it's going to a lower refractive index. So, the reflection occurs when entering a lower refractive index medium, meaning the reflection is from a higher to lower, so there's no phase shift upon reflection. Wait, but actually, the phase shift occurs when reflecting off a medium with higher refractive index.

Wait, let me get this clear: when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there is no phase shift.

So, the light is first incident on oil. At the oil-water interface, it reflects. Since oil (1.5) is higher than water (1.33), no phase shift for this reflection? Wait, no, the reflection is at the interface between oil and water, so when light comes from air (n=1) into oil (n=1.5), then at the oil-water interface, it's going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), which is lower. So, reflection occurs when going from oil to water, which is a lower refractive index. So, no phase shift for that reflection (R1).

Then, the transmitted light goes into the oil, reflects off the water surface. So, at the water-oil interface, light is going from water (n=1.33) to oil (n=1.5), which is higher. So, reflection here is from a lower to higher refractive index, which causes a phase shift of π (R2).

Therefore, R1 has no phase shift, R2 has a phase shift of π. Additionally, the light that went through the oil travels an extra distance of 2t, which is 1000 nm.

Now, the path difference in the oil is 2t = 1000 nm. The wavelength of light in oil is λ_oil = λ0 / n_oil = λ0 / 1.5.

The number of wavelengths in the oil is (1000 nm) / (λ0 / 1.5) ) = (1500 / λ0).

Each wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of 2π, so the phase difference due to the path is (1500 / λ0) * 2π.

But also, R2 has a phase shift of π relative to R1. So, the total phase difference between R2 and R1 is:

Phase difference = (1500 / λ0) * 2π + π.

We want constructive interference, so the total phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π:

(1500 / λ0) * 2π + π = 2π * m, where m is an integer.

Let's divide both sides by π:

1500 / λ0 * 2 + 1 = 2m

So:

3000 / λ0 + 1 = 2m

Which can be rewritten as:

3000 / λ0 = 2m - 1

Therefore,

λ0 = 3000 / (2m - 1)

So, λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. We are looking for λ0 in the visible spectrum, which is approximately 400 nm to 700 nm.

So, let's compute possible values:

For m=1: λ0=3000/(2*1-1)=3000/1=3000 nm (Infrared, outside visible)

m=2: λ0=3000/(4-1)=3000/3=1000 nm (Infrared)

m=3: λ0=3000/5=600 nm (Visible)

m=4: λ0=3000/7≈428.57 nm (UltraViolet)

m=5: λ0=3000/9≈333.33 nm (UltraViolet)

So, the only λ0 in the visible spectrum is 600 nm. So, 600 nm is the wavelength that would cause constructive interference, leading to strong reflection.

Wait, but the options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 650 nm. So, 600 nm is an option (C). But the correct answer is supposed to be 650 nm. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the phase shift?

Wait, let's re-examine the phase shifts.

When light reflects at the oil-water interface (R1), it's going from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), which is a lower index. So, reflection occurs at a lower index, so no phase shift.

When light goes through the oil, reflects at the water-oil interface (R2), it's going from water (n=1.33) to oil (n=1.5), higher index. So, reflection here is from a lower to higher index, thus there's a phase shift of π.

Therefore, R1 has no phase shift, R2 has a phase shift of π. So, in terms of phase difference between R2 and R1, it's π, plus the phase difference from the path.

But when light goes through the oil and comes back, the path is 2t=1000 nm. The wavelength
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about white light normally incident on a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33. There's a thin oil layer, 500 nm thick, on top of the water. The oil has an index of refraction of 1.5. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected, and the options are A. 500 nm, B. 550 nm, C. 600 nm, and D. 650 nm. The correct answer is supposed to be D, 650 nm, but I need to understand why.

Alright, so I remember something about thin film interference. When light hits a thin film, some of it reflects off the top surface, and some goes through and reflects off the bottom surface. These two reflected waves interfere with each other, causing constructive or destructive interference. The wavelength of the reflected light depends on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction of the materials involved.

I think the key here is to use the concept of constructive interference for the reflected light because that's when the reflection is strongest. For constructive interference, the path difference between the two reflected waves should be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film. The formula for the path difference is 2nt, where n is the index of refraction of the film and t is its thickness.

But wait, hold on. Since the light is coming from air (assuming the puddle is air, which it is because water is next), the first reflection is at the air-oil interface. The second reflection is at the oil-water interface. The wavelengths of light in air, oil, and water will be different because the speed of light changes with the medium.

I recall that the wavelength in a medium is given by λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since the difference is negligible). So, the wavelength in oil is λ0 / 1.5, and in water, it's λ0 / 1.33.

Now, for the path difference: the first reflected wave travels back through the oil layer and then into the air. The second reflected wave goes through the oil layer from the back and then back into the air. So, the path difference is actually 2t*(n_air + n_oil) or something? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think again. The first reflection is at the oil surface: some light reflects off the oil. The rest goes through the oil, reflects off the water, and then comes back. So, the first reflection has traveled a distance in air equal to twice the thickness of the oil layer: 2t. The second reflection has traveled 2t through the oil, but the wavelength in oil is shorter than in air.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the phase change upon reflection. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π. If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift. So, in this case, the first reflection is air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5), so there's a phase shift of π. The second reflection is oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), which is a higher refractive index? Wait, no. Wait, oil is 1.5, water is 1.33. So, oil has a higher refractive index than water. So, when light goes from oil to water, it's reflecting off a lower refractive index medium. Therefore, the second reflection will not have a phase shift.

So, the first reflection (air-oil) has a phase shift of π, and the second reflection (oil-water) has no phase shift. So, the two reflected waves are out of phase by π.

But wait, the path difference also contributes to the phase difference. So, let's compute that. The first reflection goes through 2t in air, which is just 2t. But the second reflection goes through 2t in oil, which is a medium where the wavelength is λ_oil = λ0 / 1.5. So, the path difference is 2t in oil, which is equivalent to a path of 2t * (1.5 / λ0). But in terms of phase, the number of wavelengths is (2t * 1.5) / λ0.

So, the total phase difference is the path difference in terms of wavelength plus the phase difference due to reflection. Since reflection from oil gives a phase shift of π, but reflection from water doesn't. So, the first reflection has a phase shift of π, and the second reflection has none. So, the relative phase shift between the two is π.

So, in terms of constructive interference, we want the total phase difference to be an integer multiple of 2π. So, if the path difference is (2t * 1.5) / λ0, and we add the π phase shift, then the total phase difference is (2t * 1.5) / λ0 + π.

For constructive interference, this should be equal to 2π * m, where m is an integer. So,

(2t * 1.5) / λ0 + π = 2π * m

Solving for λ0,

(2t * 1.5) / (2π * m - π) = λ0

Wait, perhaps it's better to write:

Total phase difference = (2t * 1.5 / λ0) + π = 2π * m

So,

2t * 1.5 / λ0 = 2π * m - π

Factor π,

2t * 1.5 / λ0 = π (2m - 1)

Divide both sides by π,

2t * 1.5 / λ0 = 2m - 1

Then,

λ0 = (2t * 1.5) / (2m - 1)

But t is given as 500 nm. So,

λ0 = (2 * 500 nm * 1.5) / (2m - 1)

That's,

λ0 = (1500 nm) / (2m - 1)

Now, m is an integer, so let's compute possible λ0 values:

For m=1:

λ0 = 1500 / 1 = 1500 nm. That's way longer than the options given, so it's not relevant.

For m=2:

λ0 = 1500 / 3 ≈ 500 nm.

For m=3:

λ0 = 1500 / 5 = 300 nm.

Wait, but the options are all around 500-650 nm. So, wait, perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Another way to think about it is using the formula for the reflected wavelength when there's a thin film. The formula is:

λ_reflected = 2 * n * t / (m)

Wait, no, not exactly. Because the wavelength in the film is different.

Wait, I think the formula for constructive interference is when 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ, where λ is the wavelength in vacuum. But wait, is that right? Or is it that the path difference is 2nt, but the wavelength in the film is λ/n, so the number of wavelengths that fit into 2nt is 2nt / (λ/n) = 2n t / λ.

Wait, so the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film. But since we have phase shifts, we have to consider that.

Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. When light reflects off a thin film, the condition for constructive interference is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)λ, where m is an integer.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. The path difference is 2nt. The wavelength in the film is λ/n, so the number of wavelengths in the path difference is 2nt / (λ/n) = 2nt * n / λ.

But for constructive interference, this number should be an integer. So,

2nt * n / λ = m

Thus,

λ = 2ntn / m

But wait, but also, we have to consider phase shifts. If the reflection from the first and second surfaces causes a phase shift, then we have to adjust m accordingly.

Wait, in this problem, the first reflection is air to oil, which is a higher refractive index, so it causes a phase shift of π. The second reflection is oil to water, which is a lower refractive index, so it doesn't cause a phase shift. Therefore, the two reflections have a relative phase shift of π.

So, the total phase difference is the path difference plus the relative phase shift. The path difference is 2nt, which in terms of phase is 2nt * (2π / λ_film). So, the phase difference is (2nt * 2π / λ_film) + π.

For constructive interference, the total phase difference should be 2π * m, where m is integer.

So,

(2nt * 2π / λ_film) + π = 2π * m

Divide both sides by π:

(2nt * 2 / λ_film) + 1 = 2m

So,

4nt / λ_film + 1 = 2m

But λ_film is the wavelength in the film, which is λ0 / n, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength.

So, substituting,

4nt / (λ0 / n) + 1 = 2m

Simplify:

4nt * n / λ0 + 1 = 2m

So,

(4n²t) / λ0 + 1 = 2m

Therefore,

λ0 = (4n²t) / (2m - 1)

So, λ0 = (2n²t) / (m - 0.5)

Hmm, so that's the formula I should use.

Given:

n = 1.5, t = 500 nm, and we need to find λ0.

So,

λ0 = (2*(1.5)^2*500) / (m - 0.5)

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 2*(1.5)^2*500

1.5 squared is 2.25. Multiply by 2: 4.5. Multiply by 500: 4.5*500=2250 nm.

So, λ0 = 2250 / (m - 0.5)

Now, let's find m such that λ0 is in the given options: 500,550,600,650.

So,

m - 0.5 must be 2250 / λ0

So, let's compute for each option:

Option A: 500 nm

m - 0.5 = 2250 / 500 = 4.5

So, m = 5

So, λ0 = 500, which would correspond to m=5.

But wait, let's check if this is a maximum reflection.

But wait, I thought constructive interference occurs when the condition is met, but depending on the phase shifts, sometimes it's for destructive.

Wait, no. Wait, in this case, because there was a phase shift of π between the two reflected waves, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference is (m - 0.5)λ0, not mλ0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me try to think differently. When you have two reflected waves, one with a phase shift and one without, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference is (m + 0.5)λ0, so that when you add the phase shift, it becomes mλ0.

Wait, let's think about it. The first reflection has a phase shift of π, the second doesn't. So, if the path difference is (m + 0.5)λ0, then the total phase difference is (m + 0.5)λ0 in terms of path, but since the second reflection doesn't have a phase shift, it's equivalent to path difference of (m + 0.5)λ0, but with the first reflection having π phase difference.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for constructive interference when one reflection is phase-shifted:

The condition is 2nt = (m + 0.5)λ, where λ is the wavelength in air.

Wait, but no, that's not the case.

Wait, actually, the general formula is:

For a thin film with refractive indices n1, n2, the condition for constructive interference is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)λ, where λ is the wavelength in the medium between the film and the substrate.

But in our case, the film is oil (n=1.5) and the substrate is water (n=1.33). So, the wavelength in the film is λ_film = λ0 / 1.5, and in water it's λ_water = λ0 / 1.33.

Wait, but the path difference is 2t in the oil. So, in terms of wavelength in oil, the path difference is 2t, which corresponds to how many wavelengths? It would be 2t / (λ0 / 1.5) = 3t / λ0.

But in terms of phase, each wavelength corresponds to 2π. So, the phase difference from the path is (3t / λ0) * 2π.

But also, there's a phase shift of π from the first reflection.

So, total phase difference is (3t / λ0) * 2π + π.

For constructive interference, this should equal 2π * m, where m is integer.

So,

(6π t) / λ0 + π = 2π m

Divide both sides by π:

6t / λ0 + 1 = 2m

So,

6t / (2m - 1) = λ0

Hence,

λ0 = (6t) / (2m - 1)

So, that's the formula.

Given t = 500 nm, so:

λ0 = 6*500 / (2m - 1) = 3000 / (2m - 1)

So, we need λ0 to be one of the options: 500, 550, 600, 650.

Let's compute 3000 / (2m -1) and see which one it matches.

Let me find m such that λ0 is approximately one of these.

Compute for each option:

Option A: 500

3000 / (2m -1) = 500

So, 2m -1 = 3000 / 500 = 6

So, 2m =7, m=3.5. Not integer. So, not possible.

Option B: 550

3000 / (2m -1)=550

2m -1=3000/550≈5.4545

Not integer.

Option C:600

3000 / (2m -1)=600

2m -1=5

2m=6, m=3. Integer.

So, m=3 gives λ0=600 nm.

Option D:650

3000/(2m -1)=650

2m -1=3000/650≈4.615

Not integer.

Wait, that's conflicting. So according to this, when m=3, λ0=600 nm, which is option C. But the given answer is D, 650 nm. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the phase difference calculation.

When light reflects off the oil (higher index from air), there's a phase shift of π.

Then, when it goes through the oil and reflects off water (lower index), no phase shift.

So, the two reflected waves have a relative phase difference of π.

Additionally, the path difference is 2t in oil, which corresponds to a phase difference of 2π*(2t / λ_film).

Since λ_film = λ0 / n= λ0 /1.5.

Therefore, phase difference from path is 2π*(2t / (λ0 /1.5))= 2π*(3t / λ0).

So, total phase difference is 2π*(3t / λ0) + π.

For constructive interference, total phase difference should be 2π*m.

Therefore,

2π*(3t / λ0) + π = 2π*m

Divide both sides by π:

2*(3t / λ0) +1 = 2m

Simplify:

6t / λ0 +1 =2m

So,

6t / (2m -1) = λ0

So, yes, same as before.

Given t=500,

λ0=6*500/(2m -1)=3000/(2m -1)

So, to get λ0=650,

3000/(2m -1)=650

2m -1=3000/650≈4.615. Not integer.

So, m would need to be about 2.307, which is not integer.

But for λ0=600,

3000/(2m -1)=600

2m -1=5

m=3, integer. So that's valid.

But the correct answer is supposed to be D, 650. So, maybe my formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the reflection from the back as a phase shift when it's going from lower to higher index.

Wait, let me think again. When light reflects off the oil (n=1.5) into water (n=1.33), it's going from higher to lower refractive index, so no phase shift. So, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around. Let me check another source in my mind. So, when light reflects off a medium, if it's going from low to high n, reflection causes phase shift of π; if it's going from high to low, no phase shift.

So, in our case, first reflection: air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5): low to high, so phase shift π.

Second reflection: oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33): high to low,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection on a puddle of water with an oil layer on top. I need to figure out which wavelength of white light is most strongly reflected. Hmm, okay, let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says white light is normally incident on a puddle of water. The index of refraction of water is 1.33. There's also a thin layer of oil on top, 500 nm thick, with an index of refraction of 1.5. The question is asking which wavelength of light is most strongly reflected, and the options are A. 500 nm, B. 550 nm, C. 600 nm, D. 650 nm. The correct answer is supposed to be D, 650 nm, but I need to understand why.

I remember that when light hits a boundary between two media, some of it reflects, and some of it refracts into the second medium. The reflection depends on the indices of refraction of the two media. I think this has to do with something called "constructive interference" for certain wavelengths.

Oh, right! It's about the concept of Brewster's angle and polarization, but this seems a bit different because there's an oil layer on top of water. So, maybe I need to consider multiple reflections here.

Wait, actually, I think this is about the phenomenon where certain wavelengths interfere constructively when reflecting off multiple surfaces, leading to a strong reflection. So, if we have a thin film, like the oil layer on water, the light can reflect twice: once from the top surface of the oil (oil-water interface) and then again from the bottom surface of the oil (oil-air interface). These two reflected waves can interfere with each other.

For constructive interference, the path difference between the two reflections should be an integer multiple of the wavelength. But, the path difference also depends on the thickness of the oil layer and the indices of refraction of the oil and water.

Let me recall the formula for the condition of constructive interference in thin films. The path difference is 2 * n * t * cos(theta), where n is the index of refraction of the film (oil, in this case), t is the thickness of the film, and theta is the angle of incidence. But since the light is normally incident, theta is 0 degrees, so cos(theta) is 1. Therefore, the path difference is 2 * n * t.

But wait, for reflection, there's also a phase change. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift. So, if light reflects off the oil (n=1.5) going into water (n=1.33), since 1.5 > 1.33, there is a phase shift of pi on the first reflection. Then, when it goes back through the oil to the air interface, it reflects again. Now, reflecting off oil (n=1.5) going into air (n=1), since 1.5 > 1, there is another phase shift of pi. So both reflections have a phase shift.

Hmm, so does that mean both reflected waves undergo a phase change? Then, when they interfere, would that affect the condition for constructive interference?

Let me think. When a wave reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift. So, if the first reflection (oil-water) causes a phase shift, and the second reflection (oil-air) also causes a phase shift, then each reflected wave has a phase shift of pi. So, when they recombine, the total phase shift would be 2*pi, which is equivalent to no net phase shift. Therefore, the path difference is the main factor for constructive interference.

So, for constructive interference, the condition would be 2 * n * t = m * lambda, where m is an integer, and lambda is the wavelength in vacuum.

But wait, the question is about which wavelength is most strongly reflected, so we need the wavelength where constructive interference occurs, which would be when 2 * n * t is an integer multiple of the wavelength in vacuum.

But another thought: is it 2 * n * t = m * lambda, or is it 2 * n * t = (m + 1/2) * lambda, considering the phase shifts?

Wait, no, because both reflections cause a phase shift of pi, so that's a total phase shift of 2*pi, which is equivalent to no phase shift. So, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength. So:

2 * n * t = m * lambda

But here, we need to relate lambda to the wavelength in the medium. Wait, no, lambda here is the wavelength in vacuum. Because the path difference is a physical distance, it's in terms of the medium's thickness, so we need to make sure the units match.

Alternatively, sometimes, the condition is given as 2 * n * t = m * lambda_0, where lambda_0 is the vacuum wavelength.

But actually, in thin film interference, the general condition for constructive interference (bright reflection) is:

2 * n * t cos(theta) = (m + 1/2) * lambda_0

But considering the phase shifts, if both reflections cause phase shifts, then the condition becomes 2 * n * t cos(theta) = m * lambda_0.

Wait, maybe I confused something here.

Let me double-check. When both reflections cause a phase shift, the net phase shift is 2 * 180 degrees, which is equivalent to no phase shift. So, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.

But the path difference is 2 * n * t * cos(theta). So, 2 * n * t * cos(theta) = m * lambda.

Since theta is 0 degrees, cos(theta) is 1, so it's 2 * n * t = m * lambda.

But lambda is in vacuum, right? So if we know n, t, we can find the wavelength lambda that satisfies this condition.

Wait, but in terms of wavelengths in the medium, we can also relate. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the wavelength in the medium.

Wait, hold on. The thickness t is in the oil, so the wavelength in oil is lambda_0 / n, where lambda_0 is the vacuum wavelength. So, the condition can also be written as 2 * t = (m * lambda_0) / n.

Which is the same as 2 * n * t = m * lambda_0.

So, the formula is 2 * n * t = m * lambda_0.

But in our case, n is the oil's refractive index, which is 1.5, and t is 500 nm.

So let's plug in the numbers.

n = 1.5

t = 500 nm

So 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = m * lambda_0

Which is 1500 nm = m * lambda_0

Therefore, lambda_0 = 1500 nm / m

But we need m to be an integer.

Wait, but we can't have lambda_0 being less than the wavelength in vacuum, but in this case, the reflected wavelengths are given as options, so perhaps we need to find the smallest m such that lambda_0 is in the range of visible light.

The visible spectrum is from about 400 nm to 700 nm.

So, if we take m=1, then lambda_0 = 1500 nm, which is 1500 nm / 1000 nm = 1.5 microns, which is outside the visible spectrum.

For m=2, lambda_0 = 1500 / 2 = 750 nm. Still outside.

m=3: 1500 / 3 = 500 nm. Also outside.

Wait, that can't be. So, if m increases, lambda_0 decreases. So, m=5: 1500 / 5 = 300 nm, which is UV.

But our options are all in the 500-650 nm range, which is in the red part of the visible spectrum.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe I didn't consider that the reflection occurs at two interfaces: oil-water and oil-air. So, perhaps I need to consider the interference of the two reflections, but the phase shifts might affect the condition.

Wait, as I thought earlier, both reflections cause a phase shift of pi, so when they recombine, the net phase shift is 2 pi, which is equivalent to no phase shift. Therefore, the condition is constructive when the path difference is integer multiples of lambda_0.

But if I plug in, for m=1, lambda_0 = 1500 nm, which is not visible.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the wavelength in the oil? Because the light travels through the oil twice, once going down and once going up. So the path in oil is 2t.

Wait, but 2t is 1000 nm, which is 1 micron. If I consider the wavelength in oil, which is lambda = lambda_0 / n.

So, the wavelength in oil is lambda = lambda_0 / 1.5.

So, if the path is 1000 nm, which is 1 micron, then 1 / (lambda / 1.5) = 1000 nm.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it.

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to use the formula for the constructive interference condition considering the phase changes.

When both reflections cause a phase shift, the condition is 2nt = (m + 1/2) * lambda_0. Wait, no, that is for destructive interference when there is a phase change. Wait, no, let me recall.

The general formula is:

If there is a phase change on reflection at both surfaces, then constructive interference occurs when 2nt = m * lambda_0.

If there is a phase change at one surface and not the other, then constructive interference occurs when 2nt = (m + 1/2) * lambda_0.

Wait, so in this case, both reflections cause a phase change because the oil is on top of water, and oil has higher refractive index than water? Wait, no.

Wait, the oil is on top of water, so when light goes from air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5), no phase change because n increases. Then, when it goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), n decreases, so reflection causes a phase change of pi. Then, when it reflects back from water to oil, n increases again, so another phase change. Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the first reflection is at the oil-water interface. When light goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33), since 1.5 > 1.33, reflection causes a phase shift of pi. Then, it refracts into water and travels through it, hits the bottom of the oil, which is oil-water interface again? Wait, no.

Wait, hold on, actually, the second reflection is from the oil-air interface. Wait, no, oil is on top of water, so the oil is between air and water.

Wait, let me think. The thin film is oil on top of water. So, the two surfaces are oil-water and oil-air.

So, when light comes from air (n=1) into oil (n=1.5), reflection occurs at the oil-air interface. Since n increases, reflection causes a phase shift of pi.

Then, it refracts into oil, travels down to the oil-water interface, and reflects back. So, at oil-water interface, light goes from oil (n=1.5) to water (n=1.33). Since n decreases, reflection causes a phase shift of pi.

So, both reflections (air-oil and oil-water) cause a phase shift of pi. So, both reflected waves have undergone a phase shift of pi. Therefore, when they recombine, the net phase shift is 2 pi.

Therefore, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.

So, the path difference is 2 * n_oil * t, where n_oil is 1.5 and t is 500 nm.

So, 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = 1500 nm.

So, 1500 nm = m * lambda_0

So, lambda_0 = 1500 nm / m

But since we are dealing with visible light, lambda_0 should be between 400 nm and 700 nm.

So, let's solve for m.

If m=1: lambda_0 = 1500 nm (not visible, infrared)

m=2: 750 nm (not visible, near-infrared)

m=3: 500 nm (visible, green)

m=4: 375 nm (UV)

But the options given are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 650 nm, all in the visible range.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, wait, maybe the path difference is actually 2 * n_oil * t, but considering the wavelength in the oil. Or maybe it's different.

Wait, another approach: the light reflects off the oil-water interface and then off the oil-air interface. The two reflected waves travel different paths.

The first reflection is at the oil-water interface, and the second reflection is at the oil-air interface.

The path difference between the two reflected waves is 2 * n_oil * t, because the wave goes through the oil twice (down and up).

But, since both reflections cause a phase shift of pi, the net phase shift is 2 pi, so when they interfere, it's as if they didn't have any phase shift. So, for constructive interference, the path difference must be an integer multiple of lambda_0.

So, 2 * n_oil * t = m * lambda_0

But 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = 1500 nm = m * lambda_0

Therefore, lambda_0 = 1500 / m

For m=1: 1500 nm (infrared)

m=2: 750 nm (near-infrared)

m=3: 500 nm (green)

m=4: 375 nm (UV)

Hmm, all of these are outside the visible range except when m=3, which is 500 nm. But 500 nm is visible, in the green range.

Wait, but the options include 500 nm as option A. So, why is the correct answer 650 nm?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation or misunderstood the setup.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is not about the constructive interference but about the most strongly reflected wavelength.

Wait, in thin films, sometimes when the wavelength satisfies the condition for constructive interference, the reflection is enhanced. Otherwise, it's weak.

But according to the calculation, the only wavelength that would have constructive interference is 500 nm, which is option A.

But the answer is D, 650 nm. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the Brewster angle as well. But Brewster's angle is for polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence, but here we are dealing with normal incidence, so Brewster's angle is 90 degrees, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for reflection coefficient.

Wait, reflection coefficient at each interface is (n2 - n1)/(n1 + n2). So, at oil-water interface, it's (1.33 - 1.5)/(1.5 + 1.33) = (-0.17)/(2.83) ≈ -0.06. So, reflection is about -6%.

At oil-air interface, it's (1 - 1.5)/(1 + 1.5) = (-0.5)/2.5 = -0.2, so reflection is about -20%.

But that's just the reflection coefficients; reflecting multiple times in the film might lead to interference.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the phase shift upon reflection and the path difference.

So, when light enters oil from air, reflection at oil-air interface causes a phase shift of pi. Then, it refracts into oil, travels down, reflects off water, which is a phase shift of pi again, then refracts back into oil, then reflects off oil-air again, another phase shift of pi.

Wait, no, the second reflection is off water, which is oil-water interface.

Wait, the light goes from oil to water: reflection at oil-water interface. Since n_water < n_oil, reflection causes a phase shift of pi.

Then, it refracts into water, travels through water, reaches the water-air interface, but wait, the oil is on top, so the reflection is at oil-water.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the path.

Wait, the oil is on top of water, so the light comes from air, hits oil, reflects off oil-water, goes into water, reflects off water-air, then comes back up through oil, and refracts back into air.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, no, if the oil is on top of water, the oil is the top layer, so the light comes from air, hits oil, reflects off oil-water interface, goes into oil, reflects off oil-water again? Wait, no, oil is only on the top. So, oil is between air and water.

Wait, light comes from air, hits oil at oil-air interface, reflects with a phase shift of pi. Then refracts into oil, travels down to oil-water interface, reflects off oil-water interface with another phase shift of pi, then refracts back into oil, travels up, and then refracts back into air at oil-air interface.

So, the two reflections that interfere are the ones at oil-water and oil-air.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the first reflection is at oil-water, and the second reflection is at oil-air, after the light has traveled through oil and water.

So, the two reflections are:

1. At oil-water: reflection R1
2. At oil-air: reflection R2

But wait, after the first reflection, the light goes into oil, then into water, then back into oil, then into air.

Wait, actually, the two reflections are both at oil-water and oil-air? No.

Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Air (n=1) -> Oil (n=1.5) -> Water (n=1.33)

When light comes in:

1. Hits oil-water interface:
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. It involves a puddle of water, a thin layer of oil on top, and I need to find out which wavelength of white light is most strongly reflected. The options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm. The answer is said to be D, 650 nm. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me visualize the setup. There's white light normally incident on a puddle of water. Above this water is a thin layer of oil. So, the order of materials from top to bottom is: air (assuming the question isn't considering the first medium as something else), then oil, then water.

Wait, no, actually, the light is coming from air (since it's white light normally incident), it hits the oil layer, which is on top of water. So the sequence is: air (n=1), then oil (n=1.5), then water (n=1.33). Got it.

The question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. Hmm, reflection can occur from multiple interfaces here. Specifically, when light hits the oil and the water, it can reflect off both. But I think the main reflection that affects the color would be from the oil-water interface because the oil has a higher refractive index than water. Wait, no, actually, oil has a higher refractive index than water? Let me check: oil is 1.5, water is 1.33. So oil is higher. So when the light goes from oil to water, it's going from higher to lower refractive index, which means it will refract towards the normal, and also, some light will reflect at that interface.

But also, the light first hits the oil, which is on top of the water. So when the light first enters the oil, some of it reflects off the oil's top surface (oil-air interface). But since oil has a higher refractive index than air, the reflection at oil-air interface will be less because the reflection coefficient is (n_air - n_oil)^2. Since n_oil > n_air, the reflection is minimal. So the main reflection we need to consider is the reflection that happens at the oil-water interface.

Wait, but how does the oil layer affect the reflection? It's like a thin film, right? So this is similar to the soap bubble experiment or thin film interference.

In thin film interference, the reflection at the top and bottom surfaces of the film can interfere with each other. The condition for constructive interference depends on the difference in path lengths and the phase changes upon reflection.

So, in this case, the oil layer is the film. Let's denote the thickness of the oil layer as t = 500 nm. The refractive indices are n_air = 1.0, n_oil = 1.5, n_water = 1.33.

When light hits the oil, it reflects off the oil-air interface. Since n_air < n_oil, the reflection here is partial, but because it's going from higher to lower refractive index, the reflected wave undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees (π radians). Then, the transmitted light goes into the oil, travels down to the oil-water interface, reflects there. Now, at the oil-water interface, n_oil > n_water, so again, reflection occurs. Since it's going from higher to lower refractive index, another phase shift of 180 degrees occurs.

Then, the reflected light from the oil-water interface travels back up the oil, exits into air, and the path length is 2t (down and up the oil layer). Additionally, there are two phase changes: one upon reflection at oil-water interface and another upon reflection at oil-air interface, each of 180 degrees. So total phase change is 2 * 180 = 360 degrees, which is equivalent to 0 degrees because 360 is a full cycle.

Wait, but in thin film interference, when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift. So, when light goes from oil to water, which is lower refractive index, the reflection at oil-water interface is from higher to lower, so it does not undergo a phase shift. Wait, hold on, I might be getting this mixed up.

Actually, the phase shift occurs upon reflection when the light goes from a lower refractive index to a higher one. So, if light is in medium 1, hits medium 2, if n2 > n1, then reflection causes a phase shift of 180 degrees. If n2 < n1, no phase shift.

So, in our case, oil is on top, water is below. So when light from air (n=1) hits oil (n=1.5), since 1.5 > 1, reflection here will have a phase shift of 180 degrees.

Then, the transmitted light goes into oil, then hits water. Since n_water=1.33 < n_oil=1.5, so reflection here is from higher to lower, so no phase shift.

So, the reflection that occurs at oil-water interface does not have a phase shift, while the reflection at oil-air interface does have a phase shift.

Therefore, when these two reflected waves meet, the one reflected from oil-water has zero phase shift, and the one from oil-air has a phase shift of 180 degrees. So, their path difference is 2t in terms of distance, but also, the phase difference due to reflection is 180 degrees.

Wait, the path difference is 2t because the light goes down the oil layer, reflects off water, and comes back up. So, the actual path length is 2t. However, since light travels at a speed v in a medium, the time taken is (2t)/v, which translates to a phase difference of (2π / λ) * (2t / v) = (4π t)/(λ v) but considering the medium, which is oil, the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ_air / n_oil.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's recall the condition for constructive or destructive interference in thin films.

The condition for constructive interference (maxima) is when the path difference plus the phase difference due to reflection is an integer multiple of the wavelength. Similarly, destructive interference is when it's a half-integer multiple.

The path difference is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil. The phase difference due to reflection is determined by the number of phase inversions. Since reflection at oil-air causes a 180-degree shift, and reflection at oil-water does not. So, total phase difference due to reflection is 180 degrees.

But wait, in the context of thin film interference, the phase difference upon reflection is a factor that can be considered as a half-wavelength shift if there's an odd number of phase inversions.

So, every time there's a reflection from a medium with higher refractive index, it introduces a phase shift of 180 degrees. So, in this case, the reflection at the oil-water interface is from oil (higher) to water (lower), so no phase shift. The reflection at the oil-air interface is from air (lower) to oil (higher), so it has a phase shift of 180 degrees.

Therefore, the total phase difference is 180 degrees (from oil-air reflection) plus the phase difference from the path length.

The path difference is 2t, so the phase difference is (2π / λ_air) * 2t. But since the light is traveling through oil, the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ_air / n_oil. Therefore, the phase difference from the path is (2π / λ_oil) * 2t = (2π n_oil / λ_air) * 2t.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the total phase difference and set it to an integer multiple of 2π for constructive interference.

So, total phase difference is due to path and reflection:

Δφ = (2π / λ_air) * (2t) + (π) * (number of phase inversions)

But the phase inversions: at oil-air reflection, it's 180 degrees, which is π. At oil-water reflection, no inversion. So total phase inversions are π.

Wait, but phase inversions are actually per reflection. Each reflection that causes a phase shift contributes π. So, we have one reflection that causes a phase shift (oil-air) of π. The other reflection (oil-water) does not cause a phase shift, so it adds 0. So total phase shift due to reflection is π.

Additionally, the path difference contributes a phase shift. The light goes down 2t in oil, so the optical path is 2t * n_oil, since the oil has refractive index n_oil.

Therefore, the phase shift from the path is (2π / λ_air) * (2t n_oil) = (4π t n_oil) / λ_air.

So total phase difference is:

Δφ = (4π t n_oil) / λ_air + π.

We want constructive interference, so:

Δφ = 2π m, where m is an integer.

So:

(4π t n_oil) / λ_air + π = 2π m

Divide both sides by π:

(4 t n_oil) / λ_air + 1 = 2 m

So:

(4 t n_oil) / λ_air = 2 m - 1

Thus,

λ_air = (4 t n_oil) / (2 m - 1)

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the units. Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.

Wait, actually, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference plus the phase shift from reflection equals an integer multiple of 2π. So, the total phase shift is 2π m.

The phase shift from the path is (2π / λ_air) * 2t * n_oil, because the optical path is 2t * n_oil, and the wavelength in air is λ_air.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. The phase shift due to traveling a distance d is (2π / λ) * d, where λ is the wavelength in the medium. But in this case, the light is traveling through the oil, so the wavelength in oil is λ_oil = λ_air / n_oil. So, the phase shift due to the path is (2π / λ_oil) * 2t = (2π n_oil / λ_air) * 2t.

So, correct, phase shift from path is (4π t n_oil) / λ_air.

Then, the phase shift from reflection is π (only from oil-air interface). So, total phase shift is:

(4π t n_oil)/λ_air + π = 2π m.

So, dividing by π:

4 t n_oil / λ_air + 1 = 2m.

Thus,

4 t n_oil / (2m - 1) = λ_air.

We are looking for which wavelength λ_air is most strongly reflected, which corresponds to the condition where the denominator 2m - 1 is a divisor of 4 t n_oil.

Given that t = 500 nm, n_oil = 1.5, so let's plug in the numbers:

4 * 500 nm * 1.5 = 3000 nm.

So, 3000 nm = λ_air * (2m - 1).

Therefore, λ_air = 3000 / (2m -1).

We need λ_air to be in the visible range, which is roughly 400 nm to 700 nm.

So, let's see which divisors (2m -1) of 3000 nm fall into that range.

Compute 3000 / (2m -1) = λ_air.

We need λ_air to be between 400 and 700 nm.

So, 3000 / λ_air = 2m -1 => λ_air must be such that 3000 / λ_air is an odd integer.

Let me find m such that 3000 / (2m -1) is in 400-700.

Compute 3000 / 700 ≈ 4.285, so 2m -1 must be less than or equal to 4.285, so 2m -1 <=4, so m=1: 2*1 -1=1, so λ=3000 nm, which is way beyond visible.

m=2: 2*2-1=3, so λ=1000 nm, still infrared.

m=3: 2*3 -1=5, so λ=600 nm. That's within the visible range.

m=4: 2*4 -1=7, λ≈428.57 nm, which is just within the lower end of visible light (blue-ish).

m=5: 2*5 -1=9, λ≈333.33 nm, which is ultraviolet.

Wait, but the problem says "white light", which typically refers to the visible spectrum, 400-700 nm.

So, m=3 gives λ=600 nm, which is in the visible range.

m=4 gives λ≈428.57 nm, also in visible.

So, both these wavelengths could be in the visible spectrum.

But the question is asking for the most strongly reflected wavelength, which would correspond to the one with the smallest denominator (i.e., the smallest 2m -1) that gives a visible wavelength.

Between m=3 and m=4, m=3 gives a larger λ (600) and m=4 gives a smaller λ (~428.57). So, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the condition.

Wait, the condition I used was for constructive interference, but in reality, some wavelengths might produce destructive interference, so maybe I need to check both constructive and destructive conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the wavelength for which the path difference and reflection phase shift lead to destructive interference?

Wait, no, let me think again.

In thin film interference, when light reflects off two surfaces, the total reflection can either add or cancel out depending on the conditions.

In this case, the reflection at oil-water (which is n_high to n_low, so no phase shift) and the reflection at oil-air (n_low to n_high, so phase shift of 180 degrees).

So, the light that reflects off oil-water travels back up through the oil, which is the same path as the one going down (distance 2t) but with a phase shift of 0 at oil-water, and a phase shift of 180 at oil-air.

So, the two reflected waves (from oil-water and oil-air) will interfere.

The one from oil-water has a phase shift of 0, travels distance 2t.

The one from oil-air has a phase shift of 180 degrees, travels distance 2t.

So, the difference in phase between these two is:

Δφ = (2π / λ_air) * 2t + (π - 0) = (4π t / λ_air) + π.

Wait, but for the reflection from oil-air, the phase shift itself is π, regardless of the path. So, the total phase difference between the two reflected waves is:

(4π t / λ_air) + π - 0 = (4π t / λ_air) + π.

We can think of this as the path difference (which is 2t in terms of medium, but in air it's (2t n_oil) / n_air * 2π / λ_air) plus the phase shift of π.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reflective interference.

Let me consider the general condition for constructive and destructive interference in thin films.

The formula is:

2n t cosθ = (m + 1/2) λ for destructive interference,

and

2n t cosθ = m λ for constructive interference.

But in our case, the angle of incidence is normal, so cosθ = 1.

But in our case, we also have phase shifts upon reflection. So, the condition is a bit different.

When both reflections cause a phase shift of 180 degrees, the net effect is a phase shift of 0 (because 180 + 180 = 360, which is equivalent to 0). When one reflection causes a phase shift and the other doesn't, the net phase shift is 180 degrees.

In our scenario, reflection at oil-water doesn't cause a phase shift (since n_oil > n_water), and reflection at oil-air does cause a phase shift of 180 degrees. So, the net phase shift between the two reflected waves is 180 degrees.

Therefore, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference causes an additional 180 degrees (π) phase shift, resulting in a total of 2π m, which is constructive.

Wait, no, actually, in thin film interference, if the two reflected waves have a net phase shift of 0, they add constructively. If they have a net phase shift of π, they add destructively.

Wait, let me recall: when both reflected waves have the same phase, they add constructively. When they have a phase difference of π, they cancel each other (destructive). So, the formula is:

Phase difference = (2π / λ) * (path difference) + phase difference due to reflection.

If phase difference is 2π m, constructive.

If phase difference is π, destructive.

In our case, the path difference is 2t (oil thickness, multiplied by refractive index if the light is moving through a medium, but here we are considering the path in air? Wait, no, the path is through oil.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the optical path length. The light that goes down and up the oil layer has an optical path length of 2t n_oil.

So, the phase difference from the path is (2π / λ_air) * 2t n_oil.

Then, the phase difference from reflection is π (since one reflection caused a phase shift, the other didn't). So, total phase difference is:

Δφ = (4π t n_oil) / λ_air + π.

For constructive interference, Δφ = 2π m, so:

(4π t n_oil)/λ_air + π = 2π m.

Divide both sides by π:

4 t n_oil / λ_air + 1 = 2 m.

So,

4 t n_oil / (2m - 1) = λ_air.

So, same as before. So, with t=500 nm, n_oil=1.5,

[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says, "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33. There's a thin layer of oil, 500 nm thick, floating on the surface of the puddle. The oil has an index of refraction of 1.5. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected, and the options are A. 500 nm, B. 550 nm, C. 600 nm, D. 650 nm. The explanation says the correct answer is D, 650 nm. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is."

Alright, so let's break this down. I remember that when light hits a boundary between two media, some of it reflects, and some of it refracts into the other medium. This problem involves multiple interfaces: air to oil, oil to water, and maybe even oil to water. But since the oil is on top of the water, the light first travels through air, hits the oil, then the water.

But the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. I think this has to do with interference. When light reflects off multiple surfaces, the waves can interfere with each other, either constructively or destructively, which affects the overall reflection. This is called interference reflection.

So, for thin films, like the oil layer here, we can have two reflected waves: one from the top surface (oil-air interface) and another from the bottom surface (oil-water interface). These two waves can interfere. Depending on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction, the interference can be either constructive or destructive.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, we need to find the wavelength that results in constructive interference, meaning the reflected waves add up, making the reflection stronger.

To find the condition for constructive interference, I remember the formula involving the thickness of the film, the indices of refraction, and the wavelength in a medium. The formula is:

2n1t = (m + 1/2)λ

But wait, is that for constructive or destructive? Let me think. When the path difference between the two reflected waves is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths, you get destructive interference, right? So maybe the condition for destructive is 2n1t = (m + 1/2)λ, and constructive is when it's an integer multiple? Hmm, actually, I might be mixing it up.

Let me recall: when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, you get constructive interference. But since the light is going through the film twice (once going down, once coming up), the total path difference is 2n1t, where n1 is the refractive index of the film, and t is the thickness.

But the wavelength inside the film is different from the wavelength in air because of the refractive index. So, the wavelength in the film is λ/n1. Therefore, when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film, you get constructive interference.

So, the condition is:

2n1t = mλ

Where m is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

But wait, that would be for constructive interference. For destructive, it would be:

2n1t = (m + 1/2)λ

Right. So, in this problem, we have a layer of oil (n1 = 1.5) on water (n2 = 1.33). The light comes from air (n_air ≈ 1) first.

So, when white light is incident on the oil, part of it reflects off the air-oil interface, and part refracts into the oil and reflects off the oil-water interface. These two reflected waves interfere.

Wait, but actually, when light comes from a medium with a lower refractive index to a higher one, it reflects with a phase change. When it goes from higher to lower, it doesn't have a phase change. So, reflecting off oil (n1=1.5) from air (n_air=1) would have a phase change. Reflecting off water (n2=1.33) from oil (n1=1.5) would not have a phase change because 1.5 > 1.33.

So, the first reflection (air-oil) has a phase change of π, while the second reflection (oil-water) does not. Therefore, when these two waves interfere, their phase difference is π plus the phase difference due to the path.

Wait, so let me think about this step by step.

1. The incident light comes from air (n_air=1) with a wavelength λ0 in air.
2. It hits the oil (n1=1.5). Part of it reflects back into air. This reflection occurs at a higher refractive index (n_air < n1), so there is a phase change of π (or λ/2, equivalent).
3. The rest of the light refracts into the oil and travels down to the water interface. At the oil-water boundary, part of it reflects back into oil. Since oil is higher refractive index than water (n1 > n2), this reflection does not have a phase change.
4. The light that reflects off the oil-water interface travels back up through the oil, then exits into air.

So, we have two reflected waves: one from the top (air-oil) and one from the bottom (oil-water). The path difference between these two waves depends on the thickness of the oil layer and the refractive indices.

The first reflection (air-oil) doesn't travel through the oil, so its path is zero. The second reflection (oil-water) travels down the oil (distance t), reflects, and then comes back up (distance t). So the total path length is 2t.

But because the light is traveling through the oil, the wavelength inside the oil is λ1 = λ0 / n1. So, the number of wavelengths in the path is (2t) / λ1 = (2t n1) / λ0.

But wait, I think it's more precise to consider the phase change due to the path. Each wavelength corresponds to 2π phase change. So, the phase difference due to the path is (2t n1 / λ0) * 2π.

Additionally, the two reflections have different phase changes: one has a π phase change (air-oil reflection), the other doesn't (oil-water reflection). So, the total phase difference between the two waves is the phase difference from the path plus the phase difference from the reflections.

So, total phase difference = (4π t n1 / λ0) + π.

Because the reflected wave from oil-water doesn't have a phase change, so only the first reflection has a phase change of π.

Wait, let me make sure. The first wave (air-oil reflection) has a phase change of π when it reflects. The second wave (oil-water reflection) does not have a phase change because it's reflecting off a lower refractive index medium. So, the second wave doesn't change phase, while the first does.

So, the two waves have a phase difference of π between them, in addition to any phase difference from the path.

So, the total phase difference is (4π t n1 / λ0) + π.

For constructive interference, the total phase difference should be an integer multiple of 2π. So:

4π t n1 / λ0 + π = 2π m

Where m is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

We can divide both sides by π:

4 t n1 / λ0 + 1 = 2 m

So, rearranged:

4 t n1 = (2 m - 1) λ0

Therefore,

λ0 = (4 t n1) / (2 m - 1)

Hmm, so λ0 is the wavelength in air that corresponds to constructive interference. But the question is asking about the most strongly reflected wavelength. Which would be the wavelength in air that is constructively interfered.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. It's asking for the "most strongly reflected wavelength," which could refer to the wavelength in air or the wavelength in oil. But in the context of thin films, when we talk about the reflected wavelength, it's usually referring to the wavelength in the medium, but I think here it refers to the wavelength in air, since the question gives the options as 500 nm, etc., which are typical wavelengths in air.

Wait, no, actually, hold on. The oil layer is 500 nm thick. So, the options are for the wavelength in air? Or in oil? Hmm, it's not entirely clear.

Wait, the question says: "the most strongly reflected wavelength is." So, in the context of thin films, the wavelength being referred to is usually the one in the medium. Because the interference depends on the wavelength in the medium.

But the options are just numbers without units, but given that 500 nm is the thickness, so perhaps these are wavelengths in air? Because 500 nm is the thickness, so 500 nm in air would correspond to a wavelength longer than that.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me double-check.

The oil has a thickness of 500 nm. So, if the question is about the reflected wavelength, it can refer to the wavelength in air or in oil.

But the options are A. 500 nm, B. 550 nm, C. 600 nm, D. 650 nm.

If 500 nm is the thickness, but the wavelength in oil is λ1 = λ_air / n1. So, 500 nm would be the thickness, but the wavelength would be something else.

Wait, the question says "the most strongly reflected wavelength is". So, if the film is acting as a thin film, the reflected wavelength would be the wavelength in air, but the condition for constructive interference is based on the wavelength inside the film.

But perhaps it's better to think about this in terms of the wavelength in the film. So, we need to compute the wavelength in air that would result in constructive interference when reflecting off the oil layer.

From the equation I derived earlier:

λ0 = (4 t n1) / (2 m - 1)

Where:

- λ0 is the wavelength in air
- t is the thickness of the oil (500 nm)
- n1 is the refractive index of the oil (1.5)
- m is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...)

So, plugging the values in:

λ0 = (4 * 500 nm * 1.5) / (2 m - 1)

Compute numerator: 4 * 500 * 1.5 = 4 * 750 = 3000 nm

So,

λ0 = 3000 / (2 m - 1) nm

We need λ0 to be a wavelength corresponding to one of the options: 500, 550, 600, 650 nm.

So, let's see for m =1,2,3,...

For m=1:

λ0 = 3000 / 1 = 3000 nm, which is way larger than the options.

For m=2:

λ0 = 3000 / 3 ≈ 1000 nm, still not among the options.

For m=3:

λ0 = 3000 / 5 = 600 nm. That's option C.

Wait, but the correct answer is D, 650 nm. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check.

Earlier, I set up the condition for constructive interference as 4 t n1 / λ0 + 1 = 2 m, which leads to λ0 = 4 t n1 / (2 m -1). But let's reconsider the phase difference calculation.

So, when two waves interfere, the condition for constructive interference is that the total phase difference is 2π m, right?

So, the phase difference from the path is (2π / λ1) * (2 t) because the path is 2t in the film. λ1 is the wavelength in the film, which is λ0 / n1.

So, phase difference from path: (2π / (λ0 / n1)) * 2t = (2π * 2 t n1) / λ0.

Then, the reflection at the first interface (air-oil) causes a phase change of π, while the reflection at the oil-water interface does not. So, the total phase difference is (4 π t n1 / λ0) + π.

For constructive interference, this should equal 2 π m:

4 π t n1 / λ0 + π = 2 π m

Divide both sides by π:

4 t n1 / λ0 + 1 = 2 m

So,

4 t n1 / λ0 = 2 m -1

So,

λ0 = (4 t n1) / (2 m -1)

So, that seems correct.

Plugging in t=500 nm, n1=1.5:

λ0 = (4 * 500 *1.5)/(2m -1) = (3000)/(2m -1) nm

So, for m=1, it's 3000 nm, which is too big.

m=2: 1000 nm, still too big.

m=3: 600 nm, which is option C.

But the correct answer is supposed to be D, 650 nm.

Hmm, so my calculation gives 600 nm, but the correct answer is 650. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase difference.

Wait, let's reconsider the phase change upon reflection. When light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase change of π. If it reflects off a medium with lower refractive index, it doesn't.

So, in this case, the first reflection is air to oil (n_air=1, n_oil=1.5). So, that reflection has a phase change of π.

The second reflection is oil to water (n_oil=1.5, n_water=1.33). Since 1.5 >1.33, this reflection also occurs at a higher refractive index, so it also undergoes a phase change of π.

Wait, hold on! Is that right?

Wait, actually, when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift. If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, no phase shift.

So, oil to water: oil has higher n than water, so reflecting off water would be reflecting off a lower n medium. So, actually, the reflection at oil-water interface is from a higher to a lower n, so no phase change.

Wait, but when light is going from oil to water, it's going from n=1.5 to n=1.33, which is a lower n. So, the reflection at the oil-water interface is from high to low n, so no phase change.

Wait, but the reflection at oil-water interface is the second reflection. So, the first reflection (air-oil) is from low to high n, so phase change of π. The second reflection (oil-water) is from high to low n, so no phase change.

Therefore, the two reflections have a total phase difference of π (from the first reflection) plus the phase difference from the path.

So, when I calculated earlier, I accounted for only the first reflection's phase change. So, the total phase difference is (path phase) + π.

So, the condition is:

(path phase) + π = 2π m

So,

(path phase) = 2π m - π

Which is,

(path phase) = π (2m -1 )

Since the path phase is (4 π t n1 / λ0 )

So,

4 π t n1 / λ0 = π (2m -1 )

Divide both sides by π:

4 t n1 / λ0 = 2m -1

Thus,

λ0 = (4 t n1 ) / (2m -1 )

Same equation as before. Hmm, so that leads me again to λ0 = 3000 / (2m -1 ) nm.

So, for m=1: 3000 nm

m=2: 1000 nm

m=3: 600 nm

m=4: 750 nm

Wait, hold on, m=4 would give 2m -1=7, so 3000 /7 ≈428.57 nm

But the options are 500, 550, 600, 650 nm. So, 600 nm is in the options.

So, why is the correct answer 650 nm? Hmm, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the wavelength in the oil? Let me check that.

If the problem is asking for the wavelength in the oil that is most strongly reflected, then the condition is different.

In that case, the wavelength in the oil is λ1 = λ0 / n1.

So, let's compute the condition for constructive interference in the oil, which would lead to the reflected wave adding up.

Wait, but the question says the most strongly reflected wavelength. It's ambiguous whether it's referring to the wavelength in air or in the oil.

But the options are in the 500-650 nm range, which are typical wavelengths in air. So, I think it's referring to the wavelength in air.

But according to my previous calculation, the correct wavelength is 600 nm (option C), but the correct answer is given as D, 650 nm. So, perhaps I missed a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the reflection at both interfaces, so the interference is between the two reflected waves, but with different phase changes.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the question differently.

Wait, when light reflects off a thin film, there can be two reflections: the top surface and the bottom surface. The reflection at the top surface (oil-air) is partially reflective, and the reflection at the bottom surface (oil-water) is also partially reflective.

But actually, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. So, it's about the constructive interference condition leading to maximum reflection.

But perhaps the problem is about the reflected light from both interfaces: the top reflection (from oil to air) and the bottom reflection (from oil to water). So, when these two reflections interfere, they can either add or cancel depending on the path difference and phase changes.

Wait, let me think again.

When the light hits the oil layer, part reflects back into air (call this wave 1), and part goes through the oil, reflects off the water (wave 2), and then comes back up to the oil

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection on different layers, and I need to figure out why the answer is D, 650 nm. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the setup: there's a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33. On top of this water, there's a thin layer of oil with a refractive index of 1.5. The oil has a thickness of 500 nm. White light is normally incident on this setup. The question is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected. The options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, or 650 nm, and the correct answer is 650 nm. I need to understand why.

Hmm, okay. So, when light hits a thin film, the reflection can happen from two interfaces: the top surface of the oil and the interface between the oil and the water. Both of these can contribute to the reflected light. The problem is asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected, meaning which one is most effectively reflected and contributes the most to the total reflected light.

I remember that reflected light is more intense when it undergoes a phase shift upon reflection. This happens at a boundary where a medium with a higher refractive index is surrounded by a lower one. Wait, actually, the phase shift depends on the order of the refractive indices. If light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a 180-degree phase shift (which is like a half-cycle or pi shift). If it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift. So, for constructive interference, we need light waves to be in phase after reflection and any path difference.

In this case, the oil is on top of water. So, light first hits the oil. The oil has a higher refractive index than air (since 1.5 > 1.0), so when light hits the oil, it reflects off the oil's surface. This reflection will cause a phase shift of 180 degrees because it's going from lower (air, n=1) to higher (oil, n=1.5). Then, the transmitted light goes through the oil and hits the water. Now, the oil has a lower refractive index than water (1.5 < 1.33? Wait, no, hold on. 1.5 is greater than 1.33. So, oil's refractive index is higher than water's. Therefore, when light goes from oil to water, it's going from a higher to a lower refractive index. So, reflection off the oil-water interface will have no phase shift because it's going from higher to lower n.

So, we have two reflected waves: one from the air-oil interface (phase shift of 180 degrees) and one from the oil-water interface (no phase shift). These two reflected waves can interfere with each other. If their path difference and phase shifts result in constructive interference, then the reflected light will be stronger.

The path difference comes from the oil layer itself. The light reflecting off the oil-water interface has to travel through the oil twice (once going down, once coming back up). So, the path difference is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil layer. But in terms of wavelength, since light is traveling through a medium with a refractive index n, the wavelength inside the medium is lambda/n. So, the actual path difference in terms of the wavelength in vacuum is 2t*n/oil.

Wait, let me think about that again. The physical thickness is t. The wavelength in the oil is lambda_0 / n, where lambda_0 is the wavelength in vacuum. So, the number of wavelengths along the path is 2t / (lambda_0 / n) = 2nt / lambda_0. So, the path difference is 2nt / lambda_0.

But when considering interference, we also have to account for any phase shift caused by reflection. As I mentioned earlier, reflection at the air-oil interface causes a 180-degree phase shift, while reflection at oil-water interface does not. So, the two reflected waves have a relative phase shift between them of 180 degrees.

Now, for constructive interference, the path difference plus the phase shift should result in the waves being in phase. So, if we have a phase shift of 180 degrees (pi), we can write the condition as:

2*(2pi * (2nt / lambda_0)) + pi = 2pi * k

where k is an integer. So, that's:

(4pi n t / lambda_0) + pi = 2pi k

Dividing both sides by pi:

(4n t / lambda_0) + 1 = 2k

So, 4n t / lambda_0 = 2k - 1

Which is:

lambda_0 = (4n t) / (2k - 1)

But since the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to find the wavelength (in vacuum) that satisfies this condition for some integer k.

Wait, but let me double-check the phase shift. When the first reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift of pi, and the second reflection (oil-water) doesn't cause a phase shift. So, the relative phase shift between the two reflected waves is pi. So, does that mean the path difference should be an integer number of wavelengths minus half a wavelength? Or is it the other way around?

Actually, the formula for constructive interference when there is a phase shift of pi is:

2d = (m + 1/2) lambda

where m is an integer.

But in our case, the path difference is 2nt / lambda_0, so:

2nt / lambda_0 = (m + 1/2) lambda

Wait, no, hold on. The general condition is that the total phase difference between the two waves should be an integer multiple of 2pi for destructive interference and (2m + 1)pi for constructive.

But since one wave has a phase shift of pi, the other has none, so the relative phase shift between the two is pi. So, the path difference should lead to a phase shift of either zero or pi for constructive interference. Wait, that's confusing.

Let me think again. The first reflection (air-oil) causes a pi phase shift. The second reflection (oil-water) does not. So, the two reflected waves have a relative phase shift of pi (because one is shifted by pi and the other isn't). So, when considering interference, that pi phase shift needs to be compensated by a path difference.

In order to get constructive interference, the path difference should result in a phase shift that makes the total phase shift a multiple of 2pi. So, the total phase shift is pi (from the first reflection) plus the phase shift from the path difference. If the path difference introduces a phase shift of pi, then the total is 2pi, which is constructive. If the path difference introduces a phase shift of 0, then the total is pi, which is destructively interfering.

Wait, no. The path difference itself is a physical distance, so it introduces a phase shift based on how much distance it is. The phase shift from the path difference is (2pi / lambda_0) * path.

So, if the path difference is 2nt, then the phase shift is (2pi / lambda_0)*(2nt) = 4pi nt / lambda_0. But we also have the relative phase shift due to reflections, which is pi.

So, the total phase shift between the two waves is 4pi nt / lambda_0 + pi. For constructive interference, this total phase shift should be an integer multiple of 2pi.

So:

4pi nt / lambda_0 + pi = 2pi k

Divide both sides by pi:

4nt / lambda_0 + 1 = 2k

So:

4nt / lambda_0 = 2k - 1

Therefore,

lambda_0 = (4nt) / (2k - 1)

So, lambda_0 is the wavelength in vacuum that would result in constructive interference (strong reflection) for a given order k.

Given that, we can plug in the values.

n is the refractive index of oil, which is 1.5.

t is the thickness of the oil, which is 500 nm.

So,

lambda_0 = (4 * 1.5 * 500e-9 m) / (2k - 1)

Simplify:

lambda_0 = (6e-9 m) / (2k - 1)

But wait, lambda_0 is in vacuum, and the options are given in nanometers. So, let's convert:

6e-9 m = 6 nm.

Wait, 6e-9 meters is 6 nanometers, right? So,

lambda_0 = (6 nm) / (2k - 1)

So, for k=1:

lambda_0 = 6 nm / (2*1 - 1) = 6 / 1 = 6 nm

But that's not one of the options.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's calculate 4 * 1.5 * 500 nm:

4 * 1.5 = 6

6 * 500 nm = 3000 nm

Then, lambda_0 = 3000 nm / (2k - 1)

So,

For k=1: 3000 /1 = 3000 nm

k=2: 3000 /3 ≈ 1000 nm

k=3: 3000 /5 ≈ 600 nm

k=4: 3000 /7 ≈ 428.57 nm

k=5: 3000 /9 ≈ 333.33 nm

k=6: 3000 /11 ≈ 272.7 nm

k=7: 3000 /13 ≈ 230.77 nm

k=8: 3000 /15 ≈ 200 nm

k=9: 3000 /17 ≈ 176.47 nm

k=10: 3000 /19 ≈ 157.89 nm

k=11: 3000 /21 ≈ 142.86 nm

k=12: 3000 /23 ≈ 130.43 nm

k=13: 3000 /25 ≈ 120 nm

k=14: 3000 /27 ≈ 111.11 nm

k=15: 3000 /29 ≈ 103.45 nm

k=16: 3000 /31 ≈ 96.77 nm

k=17: 3000 /33 ≈ 90.91 nm

k=18: 3000 /35 ≈ 85.71 nm

k=19: 3000 /37 ≈ 81.08 nm

k=20: 3000 /39 ≈ 76.92 nm

Wait, none of these match the options given (500, 550, 600, 650 nm). Hmm, so maybe my formula is incorrect.

Hold on, perhaps I got the reflection phase shifts wrong. Let me make sure.

When light reflects off a higher refractive index medium, it undergoes a phase shift of pi. When reflecting off a lower refractive index medium, no phase shift.

In this case, the first reflection is air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5). So, higher to higher? Wait, no. Oil is on top of water. So, the light first hits the oil.

Wait, the order is: air (n=1) is above oil (n=1.5), which is above water (n=1.33). So, reflecting at air-oil interface: from n=1 to n=1.5, so higher, so reflection causes phase shift of pi.

Reflecting at oil-water interface: from n=1.5 to n=1.33, so lower, so reflection does not cause a phase shift.

So, yes, the two reflections: one has a phase shift of pi, the other doesn't. So, the two reflected waves have a relative phase shift of pi.

Therefore, when considering interference, the two waves interfere with each other with a pi phase shift.

Wait, but in terms of constructive interference, we want the total phase difference to be an integer multiple of 2pi. So, if the two waves have a relative phase difference of pi, then for constructive interference, the path difference should be a half-integer multiple of the wavelength.

Wait, the formula for constructive interference when there is a phase shift of pi (so that the two waves are out of phase) is that the path difference should be (m + 1/2)lambda. Wait, perhaps.

Wait, when there is a phase shift of pi between the two reflected waves, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength (lambda). But since the waves are already shifted by pi, to get constructive, the path difference must compensate for that pi shift.

So, mathematically, the condition is:

Path difference = (m + 1/2) * lambda

But I might have this backwards.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for interference is:

Constructive: 2d = (m + 1/2) lambda

Destructive: 2d = m lambda

But in this case, the phase shift caused by reflection is pi. So, the two waves are already out of phase by pi. So, if the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths, then the total phase difference is (2pi * integer) + pi, which is an odd multiple of pi, which for constructive interference, the total phase should be an integer multiple of 2pi. So, in that case, we need the path difference to add an extra pi.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the condition for constructive interference when there is a phase inversion.

Wait, if you have two waves, one with a phase shift of pi and the other without, then to get constructive interference, the path difference should be (m + 1/2)lambda.

So, 2d = (m + 1/2)lambda

Where d is the path difference.

In our case, the path difference is 2nt, so:

2*(1.5)*t = (m + 1/2)lambda

But wait, no. Wait, the path difference is 2nt, but in terms of the wavelength in vacuum, lambda_0, it's 2nt / (lambda_0 / n_oil). Wait, no, the path length is physical path.

Wait, the light going through the oil twice (down and up) has a physical path of 2t. But since the oil has a refractive index of n=1.5, the optical path length is 2t * n.

So, the optical path difference is 2nt.

Therefore, in terms of the vacuum wavelength lambda_0, the path difference is:

(2nt) / (lambda_0 / n_oil) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the wavelength in oil is lambda_0 / n_oil. So, the number of wavelengths in the oil is (2t) / (lambda_0 / n_oil) = (2nt)/lambda_0.

So, the path difference in terms of wavelengths is (2nt)/lambda_0. So, if we have 2nt / lambda_0 = (m + 1/2), then:

lambda_0 = (2nt) / (m + 1/2)

But since 2t is the physical path, multiplied by n gives the optical path.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for thin film interference.

The condition for constructive interference when there is a phase shift at one interface and not the other is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

Wait, but that's when the reflections cause a phase shift. Wait, let me check.

I think the correct formula for when one reflection causes a 180-degree phase shift and the other doesn't is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

So, in our case, since the first reflection (air-oil) causes a phase shift, and the second reflection (oil-water) does not, the condition is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

Therefore, solving for lambda:

lambda = (8nt) / (m + 1)

Wait, no, wait: 2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

Multiply both sides by 2:

4nt = (2m + 1)lambda

Therefore,

lambda = (4nt) / (2m + 1)

Ah, got it.

So, in that case, lambda = (4nt)/(2m + 1)

So, plugging in the numbers:

n = 1.5

t = 500 nm

So,

lambda = (4 * 1.5 * 500 nm) / (2m + 1) = (3000 nm) / (2m + 1)

We need to find lambda that is among the options: 500, 550, 600, 650.

So, let's try m=1:

lambda = 3000 / 3 = 1000 nm

Not an option.

m=2: 3000 /5 = 600 nm

That's option C. But the correct answer is D, 650 nm.

Wait, so maybe m=3?

lambda = 3000 /7 ≈ 428.57 nm

Not an option.

m=4: 3000 /9 ≈ 333.33 nm

Nope.

Wait, perhaps m=1 gives 1000 nm, which is not an option. m=2 gives 600 nm, which is an option, but the correct answer is 650. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, let me double-check. If one reflection has a phase shift, then the condition is:

2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

Yes, that's right.

Alternatively, is the formula 2nt cos(theta) = (m + 1/2)lambda, but since we have normal incidence, theta is zero, so cos(theta) is 1.

So, 2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda

So, lambda = (2nt) / (m + 1/2)

Wait, but no, earlier I had that correct:

From 2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda, so lambda = (2nt)/(m + 1/2)

But that would be lambda = (2 * 1.5 * 500
