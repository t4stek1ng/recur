Alright, so I have this question about ARMA(p,q) models and their autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF). The options are A, B, C, D, and the correct answer is supposed to be C. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, I should recall what an ARMA(p,q) model is. ARMA stands for Autoregressive Moving Average, right? So, it's a combination of an autoregressive (AR) model and a moving average (MA) model. The parameters p and q represent the orders of the AR and MA parts, respectively. Both p and q are integers bigger than zero, so we're not dealing with cases where either is zero.

Now, I need to remember what the ACF and PACF look like for an ARMA(p,q) model. I think for AR models, the ACF decays geometrically, meaning it approaches zero as the lag increases. For MA models, the ACF is zero after a certain number of lags equal to the order of the MA part, q. 

Similarly, for PACF, in AR models, the PACF is zero after p lags, and for MA models, the PACF decays geometrically. So, putting them together, for an ARMA(p,q) model, the ACF should combine the properties of both AR and MA. That is, the ACF should decline geometrically because of the AR part, but become zero after q lags because of the MA part. 

Wait, let me make sure. For an AR(p) model, the ACF has a decay factor of θ, so it's θ^k for lag k, and it doesn't become zero. But for an MA(q) model, the ACF is zero after q lags because of the moving average. So, when we combine them, does the ACF become zero after q lags? Or does it still decline?

I think the ACF of an ARMA(p,q) model is the sum of two geometric decays, one from the AR and one from the MA. But the MA part makes the ACF zero after q lags, whereas the AR part would cause it to decay beyond that. But actually, for the ACF, the moving average part causes the ACF to become zero after q lags, while the autoregressive part, which decays geometrically, is now summed with zeros. So, the ACF is actually zero after q lags because the MA part zeros it out, right?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The ACF of an ARMA(p,q) is the sum of the ACF of the AR(p) and the ACF of the MA(q). The ACF of the AR(p) is θ^k, which is a geometric decay, and the ACF of the MA(q) is zero for k > q. So when you add them together, for k <= q, you have θ^k plus something, but for k > q, you have θ^k (from AR) plus zero (from MA). But actually, in reality, the ACF for ARMA is a combination of these two, but the MA part actually has a different structure. Wait, is the ACF of MA(q) zero for k > q? Or is it that the PACF is zero?

No, actually, for an MA(q) model, the ACF is zero after q lags because the moving average process has that property. So, for lags beyond q, the ACF is zero. So, combining that with the AR(p) part, which has a decaying ACF, the overall ACF of ARMA(p,q) would have a decaying term from the AR part, but set to zero after q lags due to the MA part. So, the ACF would decline geometrically until lag q, after which it becomes zero.

Similarly, the PACF of an ARMA(p,q) model should have the properties of both AR and MA. The PACF of an AR(p) model is θ^k for k <= p, and zero after that. The PACF of an MA(q) model is zero for all k > 0. So, when combined, the PACF of ARMA(p,q) should be θ^k for k <= p, and zero beyond that? Wait, no, because the AR part contributes θ^k for k <= p, but the MA part also contributes something?

Wait, no. For PACF, it's the inverse. For AR models, the PACF is θ^k for k <= p, and zero beyond. For MA models, the PACF decays geometrically. So, for ARMA(p,q), the PACF should be a combination where it decays geometrically for the first p lags, and then becomes zero? Or is it the other way around?

No, actually, I think for ARMA(p,q), the PACF is φ^k for k <= p, and zero beyond, similar to the AR model. But I might be confusing that with the ACF.

Wait, maybe I should recall the definition. The PACF for an ARMA(p,q) model is the same as the PACF of the AR(p) part because the MA part is a moving average, and the PACF is related to the AR part. So, the PACF of ARMA(p,q) is the same as the PACF of AR(p), which is φ^k for k = 1,2,...,p, and zero beyond. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. The PACF is a two-sided function, but in the case of ARMA models, for lags beyond p, the PACF is zero? Or does it decay?

I need to clarify. So, for an AR(p) model, the PACF is φ^k for k = 1,2,...,p and zero beyond. For an MA(q) model, the PACF is zero for all lags because the PACF is just the inverse filter of the ACF, which is zero after q lags. So, for an MA(q) model, the PACF is zero for all lags. So, when we combine AR(p) and MA(q), the PACF should combine these two. That is, for lags k = 1,2,...,p, the PACF is φ^k, and for lags beyond p, it's zero. But wait, that's not right because the MA(q) part should affect it differently.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing things. The PACF is the backcasting filter, so for ARMA models, it's the same as the AR(p) PACF. Wait, let me check.

Upon recalling, for an ARMA(p,q) model, the PACF is φ^|k| for k = 1,2,...,p and zero beyond. So, similar to the AR model. While the ACF combines both the AR and MA properties: it decays geometrically up to lag q, beyond which it is zero. Wait, that seems to align with option C: ACF declines geometrically and PACF is zero after p lags.

Wait, but the question says the correct answer is C. So, according to my thoughts, C is the correct answer because the ACF decays geometrically (from the AR part) and the PACF is zero after p lags (from the AR part). But in the question, it says the correct answer is C: ACF declines geometrically and PACF is zero after q lags. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I got the ACF and PACF confused. Let me re-examine.

For an AR(p) model:
- ACF: φ^k for all k, decaying geometrically.
- PACF: φ^k for k = 1,2,...,p, zero beyond.

For an MA(q) model:
- ACF: zero for k > q.
- PACF: for all k, it's a geometric decay because the MA(q) is a combination of white noise processes.

Wait, no, for MA(q), the PACF is zero for all k because the ACF is zero after q lags. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, in ARMA models, the ACF combines both the AR and MA effects. For ARMA(p,q), the ACF is a sum of two geometric decays: one from the AR and one from the MA. But the MA part is a moving average, so it results in the ACF being zero after q lags. The AR part contributes a geometric decay even beyond q, but because the MA part zeros it out, the overall ACF becomes zero after q lags.

Wait, but if you have an AR(p) with ACF φ^k and an MA(q) with ACF zero after q lags, then for k <= q, the ACF is φ^k + something from MA, but for k > q, it's φ^k (from AR) + 0 (from MA). So, the ACF is φ^k for all k, but for k > q, it's just φ^k, not zero. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering the properties. Let me think again.

Actually, from what I recall, for an ARMA(p,q) model, the ACF is a combination of an AR decay and an MA decay. The AR part has a decay factor of φ, so it's φ^k, and the MA part has a decay factor of θ, so it's θ^k. So, the ACF is φ^k + θ^k for k = 1,2,..., and combined, it decays geometrically because both φ and θ are less than 1 in absolute value. However, the MA part specifically causes the ACF to become zero for lags beyond q. Wait, no, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the difference equation.

The ACF of an ARMA(p,q) process can be written as:

ACF(k) = sum_{i=1}^p φ_i φ_{k-i} + sum_{i=1}^q θ_i θ_{k-i} for k=1,2,...

But the MA(q) part has a structure such that the ACF is zero for k > q. Wait, that doesn't sound right because the MA part would have a decaying ACF, not zero.

Wait, I think I confused the ACF with the PACF.

For an AR model, ACF(k) = φ^k, PACF(k) = φ^k for k <= p, 0 beyond.

For an MA model, ACF(k) = 0 for k > q, and PACF(k) decays geometrically.

So, for ARMA(p,q), the ACF combines both: it decays geometrically (from AR) and becomes zero after q lags (from MA). So, for k <= q, ACF(k) = φ^k + θ^k, but for k > q, ACF(k) = φ^k (since MA part contributes zero). Wait, but that would mean the ACF doesn't become zero after q lags, only the MA part contributes zero, but the AR part continues to contribute. So, perhaps the ACF doesn't become zero, but the PACF does.

Wait, no, I think the ACF for ARMA(p,q) is a combination of both AR and MA, but the MA part specifically affects the ACF beyond q lags. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Let me refer to a textbook or notes if I can recall.

In Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel's Time Series Analysis, ARMA models are discussed. For an ARMA(p,q) model, the ACF is the sum of the ACF of the AR(p) and MA(q) components. The ACF of the AR(p) is φ^k, and the ACF of MA(q) is zero for k > q. So, the combined ACF is φ^k for all k, but for k > q, it's only φ^k, not zero. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, the ACF of the MA(q) is indeed zero for k > q, so the combined ACF is φ^k for all k, but with an added zero from the MA part beyond q. But adding zero doesn't change it. So, is the ACF of ARMA(p,q) equal to the ACF of AR(p)? That doesn't sound right.

Wait, maybe my understanding is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps in ARMA(p,q), the ACF is the sum of the AR and MA components, but the MA part causes the ACF to become zero after q lags. So, for k <= q, it's a combination of both decays, φ^k + θ^k, and for k > q, it's just φ^k, which still decays but isn't zero.

Hmm, that seems inconsistent with what I remember.

Wait, no, perhaps the ACF is φ^k for k <= q, and then for k > q, it's zero. But that would be if the MA part zeroed it out beyond q. But in reality, the ACF is φ^k for all k, because the AR part continues to decay. But the MA part doesn't affect the ACF beyond q; it affects the PACF.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between ACF and PACF.

So, for the PACF of ARMA(p,q), it's the same as the PACF of AR(p), which is zero beyond p lags. Wait, no, the PACF is a two-sided function, but for ARMA models, the PACF is φ^k for k = 1,2,...,p and zero beyond, similar to the AR model.

Wait, no, actually, the PACF of an ARMA(p,q) model is the same as the PACF of AR(p), which is φ^k for k = 1,2,...,p and zero beyond. The MA part affects the ACF, not the PACF.

Therefore, the ACF of ARMA(p,q) is a combination of the ACF from the AR part (φ^k) and the ACF from the MA part (zero after q lags). So, for k <= q, ACF(k) = φ^k + something from MA, but for k > q, ACF(k) = φ^k. So, it's a combination of both, but it doesn't become zero after q lags. Instead, it continues to decay as φ^k beyond q.

But that contradicts the initial thought that the ACF becomes zero after q lags.

Wait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I should think about specific examples.

Suppose we have ARMA(1,1), which is the ARMA model with p=1, q=1. So, it's a simple ARMA model.

The ACF for ARMA(1,1) is φ^k + θ^k for k=1,2,... It's a combination of two geometric decays. It doesn't become zero after any lag; it's the sum of two decays.

But wait, for ARMA(1,1), the ACF is indeed a combination of φ^k and θ^k, so it doesn't become zero after any lag. But for PACF, it's φ^k for k=1,2,...,1 and zero beyond, which is just φ.

Wait, so for ARMA(p,q), the PACF is φ^k for k=1,2,...,p and zero beyond, similar to the AR model. So, the PACF of ARMA(p,q) is the same as that of AR(p). The ACF is a combination, but it doesn't become zero after any lags, unless the moving average part has a specific structure to make it zero beyond q lags.

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to refer to the structure of ARMA models.

In ARMA(p,q), the process is defined as:

X_t = sum_{i=1}^p φ_i X_{t-i} + sum_{i=1}^q θ_i ε_{t-i}

where ε_t are i.i.d. errors.

So, the ACF function is:

ACF(k) = sum_{i=1}^p φ_i φ_{k-i} + sum_{i=1}^q θ_i θ_{k-i}

But wait, that's for k=1,2,...

Wait, but the second term is sum_{i=1}^q θ_i θ_{k-i}, which is the ACF of the MA(q) part.

But in an MA(q) process, the ACF is zero for k > q. So, for the MA(q) part, the ACF is zero for k > q, and for the AR(p) part, it's φ^k.

Therefore, combining these, for k > q, the ACF is φ^k, but for k <= q, it's φ^k + something.

Wait, but the MA(q) part's ACF is zero for k > q, so the combined ACF is φ^k for all k.

But that contradicts my initial thought that the ACF would be zero after q lags.

Alternatively, perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe in ARMA(p,q), when you add an MA(q) to an AR(p), the ACF of the combined process is the sum of the ACF of AR(p) and the ACF of MA(q). The ACF of AR(p) is φ^k for all k, and the ACF of MA(q) is zero for k > q. Therefore, the ACF of ARMA(p,q) is φ^k for all k, but for k > q, only φ^k remains because the MA(q) contributes zero.

But that still doesn't imply that the ACF is zero after q lags.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as the ACF of AR(p) is a decaying exponential, and the ACF of MA(q) is zero beyond q. When you add these two, it's as if you have a decaying exponential plus zero beyond q, so the combined ACF is a decaying exponential for all lags. Therefore, the ACF of ARMA(p,q) is not zero after q lags, but continues to decay.

So, that would mean the ACF is decaying geometrically (from
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about ARMA(p,q) models and their autocorrelation functions (acf) and partial autocorrelation functions (pacf). The question is asking which option correctly describes the acf and pacf for an ARMA model, and the correct answer is said to be C. But I want to understand why that's the case.

First, let me recall what an ARMA(p,q) model is. It's a stationary time series model that combines an autoregressive (AR) part of order p and a moving-average (MA) part of order q. So, ARMA(p,q) is an AR model where each term is also an MA term, and vice versa.

Now, the acf of an ARMA model is the covariance function, which can be derived from the properties of the AR and MA components. For an AR(p) model, the acf decays geometrically because the effect of each lag diminishes by a factor of the AR coefficient, which is between 0 and 1 in absolute value. On the other hand, for an MA(q) model, the acf is zero after q lags because the moving-average process essentially sums up q independent noise terms, leading to no autocorrelation beyond q lags.

But in an ARMA(p,q) model, both the AR and MA parts are present. So, the acf should reflect both effects. The AR part causes the acf to decay geometrically, and the MA part causes the acf to become zero after q lags. Therefore, the acf should decline geometrically but also become zero after q lags. That seems to be the case for option C.

Now, let me think about the pacf. The partial autocorrelation function is the acf after removing the effects of previous lag terms. For an AR(p) model, the pacf after p lags is zero because all the autocorrelation comes from the AR structure. For an MA(q) model, the pacf never becomes zero because the MA process introduces autocorrelation at every lag up to infinity.

But in an ARMA(p,q) model, the partial autocorrelation function will have a different behavior. Since the model combines both AR and MA, the pacf will have a finite number of non-zero lags. Specifically, the AR part affects the first p lags, and the MA part affects the next q lags. But the way the two interact is a bit more complex.

Wait, actually, maybe I should remember that for ARMA(p,q), the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. Since the AR acf decays geometrically and the MA acf is zero after q lags, the combined acf will decline geometrically but will be zero beyond q lags. That supports option C.

For the pacf, let's consider that the AR part will cause the pacf to be non-zero up to p lags, and the MA part will cause it to be non-zero beyond p lags, but how exactly? Hmm. I think it's more about how the partial autocorrelation function is computed. The pacf at lag k is the acf at lag k minus the sum of the acfs at lags 1 through k-1, scaled by some factor.

But in an ARMA(p,q) model, the effect of the AR and MA parts combine in such a way that the pacf becomes zero after q lags. Wait, is that correct? I might be confusing this with something else.

Let me think of the properties of ARMA models. The acf of ARMA(p,q) is the same as the acf of an ARMA(p,q) model, which is a combination of a geometric decay (from AR) and a zero beyond q lags (from MA). So the acf declines geometrically but becomes zero beyond q lags.

Regarding the pacf, the partial autocorrelation function for ARMA(p,q) has a finite number of non-zero lags. Specifically, the first p lags are non-zero because of the AR part, and the next q lags might also be non-zero due to the MA part, but after that, the pacf becomes zero. Wait, is that correct?

No, actually, the pacf for ARMA(p,q) is zero beyond p + q lags? Or is it different? Hmm, maybe I need to refer to some properties.

I remember that for ARMA(p,q), the acf is equal to the acf of an ARMA model, which combines the decaying exponential from the AR and the zeros from the MA. So, the acf is non-zero for lags less than or equal to p (from AR) and also non-zero for lags up to q (from MA), but since MA contributes after the AR, perhaps the acf after q lags is zero. Wait, but how does the AR and MA interact?

Wait, maybe the correct way is that the acf of ARMA(p,q) is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. The AR acf is geometrically decaying, and the MA acf is zero beyond q lags. So the combined acf is geometrically decaying up to q lags, and then it's zero beyond that. But no, that can't be because the AR and MA are separate.

Wait, actually, no. The MA acf is zero beyond q lags, but the AR acf is not zero; it just decays geometrically. So the combined acf should be the sum of two terms: one decaying geometrically and the other zero beyond q lags. So, the acf would decline geometrically up to q lags, and beyond that, only the AR part would remain. But no, the MA part is zero beyond q lags, so the total acf beyond q lags is just the AR acf.

Wait, but in the ARMA model, the process is a combination of AR and MA, so the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. So the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, while the AR acf is decaying. So, the total acf is the sum of a decaying term and zero, which would mean that the acf is non-zero beyond q lags as well, just decaying. That contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, so maybe my initial understanding is wrong. Let me check.

Upon reflection, I think for ARMA(p,q), the acf is not zero beyond q lags because the AR part continues to contribute beyond q lags, just decaying as 1/phi^k for each lag k. But actually, the MA part contributes only up to q lags. So, for lags beyond q, the acf is purely from the AR part, so it's decaying geometrically.

Wait, that would mean the acf is decaying geometrically, never becoming zero. But that's not correct because the MA part is zero beyond q lags, so the acf is zero beyond q lags plus the AR part. Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the acf for ARMA(p,q) as the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. The AR acf is a geometric decay, and the MA acf is zero beyond q lags. So, the combined acf would be a geometric decay up to q lags, and beyond q lags, only the AR part remains, so it would still be decaying. Therefore, the acf is a combination of these two, which might not be purely decaying but have a finite number of non-zero lags beyond the AR part.

Wait, no, actually, the AR acf is not zero; it's always decaying. So, the acf of ARMA(p,q) is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf, which would mean that the acf is the AR acf (geometric decay) for all lags, plus the MA acf (which is zero beyond q lags). Therefore, the acf for ARMA(p,q) would be the same as the AR acf for all lags beyond q, since the MA part doesn't contribute anything beyond q. So, the acf would be zero beyond q lags for the MA part and the decaying AR part continues. Hmm, but that suggests the acf is non-zero beyond q lags as well, just decaying.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me try to recall some properties.

I recall that in an ARMA(p,q) model, the acf is such that it's a combination of a decaying exponential (from AR) and a finite impulse response (from MA). Therefore, the acf decays geometrically but also becomes zero beyond q lags. Hmm, that seems to agree with option C.

Wait, but if the acf is the sum of a decaying term and a zero term beyond q, then is the acf also zero beyond q? No, because the AR acf is not zero beyond q, it's just decaying. So, the acf is non-zero beyond q lags because of the AR component.

So, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Then why is the correct answer C? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the definition. The acf for ARMA(p,q) is given by:

acf_k = sum_{i=1}^k phi_i * psi_{k-i} for k = 1,2,...

Where phi_i are the AR coefficients and psi_i are the MA coefficients.

Since the MA coefficients psi_i are zero for i > q, the acf becomes:

For k = 1 to p: acf_k = sum_{i=1}^k phi_i * psi_{k-i}

But since psi_{k-i} is zero if k - i > q, that is, if i < k - q. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, for lags beyond q, the MA part doesn't contribute because psi_i is zero for i > q. So, for k > q, acf_k = sum_{i=1}^k phi_i * psi_{k-i} = sum_{i=max(1, k - q)}^k phi_i * psi_{k-i}

But since psi_{k-i} is zero for k - i > q, i.e., i < k - q, so for k > q, the sum starts from i = k - q +1.

Therefore, for k > q, acf_k = sum_{i=k - q +1}^k phi_i * psi_{k - i}

But since k - i < q for these terms, psi_{k - i} is non-zero.

Therefore, for k > q, acf_k is a sum over the last q terms of the AR coefficients multiplied by the corresponding MA coefficients.

So, in effect, the acf for k > q is a linear combination of the last q AR coefficients with the MA coefficients.

But in terms of decay, does this sum decay geometrically?

Wait, maybe not necessarily. The AR coefficients are constants, and the MA coefficients are also constants, so the acf beyond q lags is a linear combination of constants, which is a constant. But that can't be because the MA part is supposed to have the effect beyond q lags.

Wait, no, the MA coefficients for lags beyond q are zero, so for k > q, acf_k is a combination of the last q AR coefficients and the corresponding MA coefficients. So, it's not a decaying term, but a combination of constants.

Hmm, so maybe the acf beyond q lags is a combination of constants, which is a flat line, not decaying. That would contradict the geometric decay.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

In an ARMA(p,q) model, the acf is the same as that of an AR(p) model but with an added MA(q) effect. So, the acf is a combination of a decaying exponential (from AR) and a finite impulse response (from MA).

Therefore, the acf should decline geometrically up to lag q, and then continue to decline beyond that, but perhaps the rate of decline is different. Or maybe it becomes zero beyond q lags?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the AR part continues to affect the acf beyond q lags, just decaying at a different rate.

Alternatively, maybe the acf beyond q lags is zero because the MA part has no effect beyond q lags, but the AR part is still affecting it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check some references or properties.

Upon recalling, in ARMA models, the acf is a combination of a decaying exponential from the AR part and a finite duration from the MA part. So, the acf will have a decaying term from the AR up to lag p, and a decay from the MA up to lag q, but I think the overall effect is that the acf decays geometrically but is zero beyond q lags.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the AR part is still contributing beyond q lags, so the acf shouldn't be zero beyond q lags. But the MA part is zero beyond q lags.

I think I need to clarify this.

Let me think of an example. Suppose we have an AR(1) model, which is a simple exponential smoothing model: Y_t = alpha Y_{t-1} + epsilon_t. The acf for this model is phi^k, which decays geometrically.

Now, if we have an MA(1) model: Y_t = epsilon_t + theta epsilon_{t-1}. The acf here is theta for lag 1 and zero for lags beyond that.

Now, what about an ARMA(1,1) model? This is the ARMA model with both p=1 and q=1, which is the ARMA(1,1) model.

The acf for ARMA(1,1) is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf:

acf_k = phi * psi_k + psi * phi^k.

Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, for ARMA(p,q), the acf is the sum from i=1 to p of phi_i * psi_{k-i} for lags k up to infinity. So, for ARMA(1,1), the acf at lag k is phi * psi_k + psi * phi^{k-1}.

Wait, but in ARMA(1,1), both phi and psi are equal to 1 (assuming unit roots), so the acf becomes 1 + 1/(k-1) for k >=2. Wait, that can't be right because the acf for ARMA(1,1) is 1 + 1/(k-1). That doesn't make sense because the acf should decay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recall that for ARMA(1,1), the process is a random walk, right? Because it's AR(1) + MA(1). So, Y_t = alpha Y_{t-1} + epsilon_t - theta epsilon_{t-1}.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Actually, the ARMA(1,1) model is equivalent to a random walk with a constant mean. Its acf is 1 + 1/(k-1) for k >=2, which does not decay geometrically. Therefore, the acf doesn't decay geometrically in this case, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, so in an ARMA(1,1) model, the acf is not decaying geometrically, but it's 1 + 1/(k-1). So, in this case, the acf is not zero beyond any lags, it's still non-zero for all lags, just that the contribution from the MA part diminishes as k increases.

So, this suggests that the acf of ARMA(p,q) is a combination of the AR part and the MA part, and it doesn't necessarily decay geometrically. So, perhaps my earlier assumption that the acf decays geometrically is only when the AR part is of higher order or something.

Wait, no, in the AR(p) model, the acf does decay geometrically. In the MA(q) model, the acf is zero beyond q lags. In the ARMA(p,q) model, the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. So, the acf is not purely AR or MA, but a combination.

So, the acf will have a decaying term (from AR) and a term that is zero beyond q lags (from MA). Therefore, the acf will decline geometrically but will be zero beyond q lags. That seems to make sense.

Wait, but in the case of ARMA(1,1), the acf is 1 + 1/(k-1), which doesn't decay geometrically. So, perhaps the acf doesn't necessarily decay geometrically for all lags, only up to a certain point.

Wait, maybe the decay is geometric only for lags less than or equal to p + q? Or maybe not. I'm getting more confused.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider the properties of the acf and pacf for ARMA(p,q).

1. The acf of ARMA(p,q) is a sum of the acf of AR(p) and MA(q). Therefore, it's a combination of a decaying exponential (from AR) and a finite duration (from MA). So, the acf should decline geometrically but also be zero beyond q lags? But in the ARMA(1,1) case, the acf is not zero beyond any lags.

Wait, perhaps in higher-order ARMA models, the acf beyond q lags is a combination of decaying terms from the AR part. So, the acf beyond q lags is non-zero but decays geometrically. Therefore, the acf is decaying geometrically for all lags, not necessarily zero beyond q lags.

But then why is the correct answer C?

Wait, maybe I'm conflating acf and pacf.

The correct answer is C: an acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags.

Wait, so maybe the acf does decline geometrically, but the pacf is zero after q lags.

Let me think about the pacf for ARMA(p,q). The partial autocorrelation function is
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about ARMA(p, q) models and their autocorrelation functions (acf) and partial autocorrelation functions (pacf). I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that an ARMA(p, q) model has a structure defined by:

\[ X_t = \mu + \theta_1 X_{t-1} + \theta_2 X_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_p X_{t-p} + \epsilon_t + \eta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \dots + \eta_q \epsilon_{t-q} \]

where \( \mu \) is the mean, \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_p \) are the AR coefficients, and \( \eta_1, \eta_2, \dots, \eta_q \) are the MA coefficients.

I also recall that the acf of an ARMA(p, q) process has a finite order, specifically it decays geometrically after a certain number of lags. This is because the ARMA model has a linear, stable filter, which implies the acf decays exponentially. So, the acf should decline geometrically, which is part of option A and C.

Now, the pacf is the partial autocorrelation function, which is related to the acf. For ARMA models, the pacf can be derived from the acf by removing the overlap between the AR and MA components. Specifically, the pacf at lag k is non-zero only when k ≤ p for the AR part and k ≤ q for the MA part.

Wait, let me think: For ARMA(p, q), the pacf is non-zero only up to lag p for the AR part and up to lag q for the MA part. But actually, the pacf combines both the AR and MA effects. So, the pacf will have non-zero values for lags k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ p and 1 ≤ k ≤ q. So, the overlap is up to the minimum of p and q. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me recall.

Actually, for ARMA(p, q), the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. The AR acf decays geometrically and the MA acf is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter of length q. The pacf can be found by taking the difference between the acf at lag k and the acf at lag k-1. For ARMA models, the pacf will have non-zero values up to lag p (from the AR part) and up to lag q (from the MA part). So, in terms of the number of lags where the pacf is non-zero, it depends on both p and q.

But wait, actually, after some lags, the acf will have contributions from both the AR and the MA parts. So, the acf for ARMA(p, q) is the sum of the AR(p) acf and the MA(q) acf.

The AR(p) acf decays geometrically because AR models have infinite acf that decays as (1 - phi_r)^k for lag k, where |phi_r| < 1. The MA(q) acf is a finite impulse response, so it becomes zero after q lags.

So, the overall acf of ARMA(p, q) is the sum of a decaying geometric series (from AR) and a finite impulse response (from MA). This combination results in an acf that decays geometrically but has a finite tail from the MA part.

But how does this affect the pacf? The pacf is the partial autocorrelation, which is derived by removing the overlapping parts. For ARMA(p, q), the pacf will have non-zero values up to the minimum of p and q. Hmm, actually, no, that might not be quite right.

Wait, I think I need to recall the relationship between acf, pacf, and ARMA models.

For AR models, the acf is (1 - phi_r)^k for k = 1, 2, ..., so it decays geometrically but never becomes zero. The pacf for AR(p) is the same as the acf because each lag is just a partial correlation. So, for AR(p), both acf and pacf decline geometrically.

For MA(q) models, the acf is a finite impulse response, meaning it is zero after q lags. The pacf for MA(q) is the same as the acf because there are no overlapping autocorrelations beyond the MA order. So, for MA(q), the pacf is zero after q lags.

Now, for ARMA(p, q), the acf is a combination of the AR and MA effects, as I mentioned earlier. So, the acf should have a decaying geometric component from the AR and a finite component from the MA. Then, the pacf is the difference between the acf at lag k and the acf at lag k-1. This process will isolate the effects of the MA part after a certain number of lags.

Specifically, after the MA part's influence is separated, the pacf will have contributions from both the AR and MA parts. However, the MA component only affects a finite number of lags. So, after a certain number of lags, the MA contribution becomes zero, while the AR part continues to decay.

Therefore, the acf of ARMA(p, q) will decline geometrically, and the pacf will be zero after q lags because the MA component only contributes up to q. But wait, does that mean the AR part will continue to affect the pacf beyond q lags?

Hmm, actually, the AR part affects the acf indefinitely, but after q lags, the MA component's influence is completely removed. So, the pacf, which is the acf minus the acf of the previous lag, will have a structure where beyond q lags, only the AR component is left, but it's still there as a decaying term. Wait, that would mean the pacf is non-zero beyond q lags because of the AR component, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully. The acf for ARMA(p, q) is the sum of the AR acf (which decays geometrically) and the MA acf (which is a finite impulse response). So, the overall acf is a combination of a decaying exponential and a finite spike.

Then, when we take the pacf, which is acf(k) - acf(k-1), this will have the effect of canceling out the AR component because:

pacf(k) = acf(k) - acf(k-1) = [AR_acf(k) + MA_acf(k)] - [AR_acf(k-1) + MA_acf(k-1)].

This simplifies to:

= AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1) + MA_acf(k) - MA_acf(k-1)

But AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1) is the difference of a geometric sequence, which is AR_acf(k-1)*(theta1 - 1). Hmm, this seems like an AR process.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that for ARMA(p, q), the pacf is zero after q lags. Is that the case?

Wait, no. For AR(p), the pacf is non-zero for all lags. For MA(q), the pacf is non-zero only up to q lags. For ARMA(p, q), the pacf is non-zero for lags from 1 to p (from the AR part) and up to q lags (from the MA part). So, actually, the pacf is non-zero up to the minimum of p and q? Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should look up the properties of ARMA models' acf and pacf.

From what I remember, the acf of an ARMA(p, q) model decays geometrically and has a finite tail because of the MA(q) component. The pacf, on the other hand, is a combination of the AR and MA effects, but the MA effect only persists up to lag q.

Wait, so the acf decays geometrically forever, but the MA component adds a finite spike. So, after q lags, the MA component's effect is gone, but the AR component continues to cause the acf to decay. So, the acf is always decaying, but the pacf has a tail up to q lags.

Wait, no, the pacf is the same as the acf for AR models beyond the AR order, isn't it?

Wait, let me clarify. For ARMA(p, q), the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. The AR acf is a geometrically decaying infinite series, while the MA acf is a finite series of length q.

So, the acf will have contributions from both the AR and MA. The MA part contributes a spike at lags 1 through q, while the AR part contributes a decaying tail beyond that.

When we take the pacf, which is the difference between acf(k) and acf(k-1), this operation effectively subtracts the overlapping parts and isolates the MA component. So, for lags beyond q, the MA component is gone, but the AR component is still there because the acf(k) - acf(k-1) will still have the AR component.

Wait, but for AR models, the acf(k) - acf(k-1) is equal to the acf(k-1)*(theta1 - 1), which is the same as the AR acf. So, for ARMA(p, q), after lag q, the MA part is gone, and the pacf reduces to the AR acf. But the AR acf is a decaying geometric series, so the pacf would continue to decline geometrically beyond lag q.

But wait, that seems conflicting. If the MA component is gone after q lags, the pacf beyond q would be the same as the AR acf, which is decaying geometrically. So, in that case, the pacf would decline geometrically beyond q lags, not be zero.

Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.

Wait, for MA(q), the acf is zero after q lags, and the pacf is the same as the acf because there's no overlap. For AR(p), the acf is decaying, and the pacf is the same as the acf.

For ARMA(p, q), the acf is the sum of the AR acf (decaying) and the MA acf (finite). So, the acf decays but has a finite sum from the MA component. The pacf is derived by subtracting the acf(k-1) from acf(k). So, the MA component contributes up to lag q, but after that, the MA component is zero, so the pacf beyond q is equal to the AR acf at lag k minus the AR acf at lag k-1, which is the same as the AR acf itself, which is decaying geometrically.

Therefore, the acf is decaying geometrically forever, and the pacf beyond q lags is the same as the AR acf, which is still decaying. Therefore, the pacf is not zero after q lags but continues to decay. However, at lag q, the MA component is gone, so the pacf beyond q is just the AR component.

Wait, but in the options, option C says the pacf is zero after q lags. That suggests that beyond q lags, the pacf is zero, which contradicts what I just thought.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me look at the options again:

A. An acf and pacf that both decline geometrically.

B. An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after p lags.

C. An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags.

D. An acf that is zero after p lags and a pacf that is zero after q lags.

Given that, and knowing that for ARMA(p, q), the acf is a combination of a decaying geometric series (from AR) and a finite spike (from MA), the acf itself should still decline geometrically because the AR component dominates the decay. Therefore, the acf in ARMA(p, q) does decline geometrically, so options A, B, C, and D can be considered.

Now, for the pacf:

In AR(p), the pacf is non-zero for all lags, and decays geometrically.

In MA(q), the pacf is non-zero for the first q lags.

In ARMA(p, q), the pacf will have contributions from both the AR and MA parts. Specifically, the pacf for ARMA(p, q) will have non-zero values up to the minimum of p and q? Or is it up to p and q?

Wait, actually, for ARMA(p, q), the pacf is non-zero up to lag p for the AR component and up to lag q for the MA component. However, after lag q, the MA component's influence is gone, so the pacf beyond q is only due to the AR component. But the AR component's pacf is non-zero for all lags, just decaying. Therefore, the pacf for ARMA(p, q) is non-zero for all lags up to infinity? No, that can't be, because MA(q) would have made the pacf zero beyond q.

Wait, no. Let me think more clearly.

The acf of ARMA(p, q) is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. The MA acf is zero after q lags. So, the acf is a combination of a decaying geometric series (AR) and a finite spike (MA). Therefore, the acf is a combination of a decaying term and a spike that dies off after q lags.

When we take the pacf, which is acf(k) - acf(k-1), this operation will isolate the effects of the MA component and the AR component.

For lags k ≤ q, both the AR and MA components contribute, so the pacf will have non-zero values.

For lags k > q, the MA component is gone, so the pacf reduces to the AR acf(k) - acf(k-1), which is the same as the AR acf itself, which is non-zero.

Therefore, the pacf for ARMA(p, q) is non-zero for all lags k ≥ 1 because the AR component is always there. So, the pacf does not become zero after q lags, which would make option C incorrect because it says the pacf is zero after q lags.

Wait, now I'm confused because the correct answer is said to be C.

Let me check online or my notes. Hmm, since I can't access external resources, I need to recall properly.

Wait, in AR models, the acf is the same as the pacf because all lags have non-zero, decaying values. In MA models, the acf is a finite impulse response, and the pacf is the same.

In ARMA models, the acf is the sum of both, so it's a combination of a decaying term and a finite spike. The pacf is the difference between acf(k) and acf(k-1). So, for k > q, the MA component's acf is zero, so:

pacf(k) = acf(k) - acf(k-1) = [AR_acf(k) + 0] - [AR_acf(k-1) + 0] = AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1)

But AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1) is equal to AR_acf(k-1)*(theta1 - 1) for an AR(1) model, which is decaying. So, in ARMA(p, q), for k > q, the pacf(k) = AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1) is still decaying, but it's the same as the AR acf, which is non-zero.

Therefore, the pacf does not become zero after q lags but continues to decay. This suggests that option C is incorrect because it says the pacf is zero after q lags.

Wait, but the question says the correct answer is C. So, I must have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the acf with the pacf.

Wait, maybe for ARMA(p, q), the acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf, which decays geometrically and has a finite tail. Therefore, the acf is decaying geometrically but also has a tail. However, the pacf is the difference between acf(k) and acf(k-1). For lags beyond q, the MA acf is zero, so the pacf(k) = acf(k) - acf(k-1) = AR_acf(k) - AR_acf(k-1), which is the same as the AR acf, which is decaying, not zero.

Wait, but for AR(p), the pacf is equal to the acf, which is decaying. So, in ARMA(p, q), the pacf is equal to the AR acf for k > q. Therefore, the pacf is non-zero for all lags, but for lags beyond q, it's just the AR acf.

Therefore, the acf is decaying geometrically, and the pacf is zero after q lags? No, that can't be. Because for AR(p), the pacf is non-zero for all lags.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the MA component's influence on the acf is only up to q lags, but the AR component continues indefinitely.

Therefore, the acf is a combination of a decaying term (AR) and a spike (MA). The MA spike dies out after q lags, but the AR term continues.

When taking the pacf, which is the difference between acf(k) and acf(k-1), for lags beyond q, this difference is just the AR acf(k) - AR acf(k-1
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this question about ARMA models, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that ARMA(p, q) stands for Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with orders p and q. Both p and q are positive integers, which makes sense because you can't have a fraction of an order in time series models.

The question is about the properties of the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for an ARMA(p, q) model. The options given are about how these functions behave—whether they decline geometrically or become zero after a certain number of lags. 

I think I need to recall what an ARMA model entails. An AR model of order p implies that the process has p past values that can predict the current value. Similarly, an MA model of order q implies that the process has q forecast errors that can predict the current value. So together, ARMA(p, q) uses both past observations and forecast errors to model the process.

Now, the ACF for an ARMA process. I remember that for AR models, the ACF decay exponentially, meaning it declines geometrically. On the other hand, for MA models, the ACF is zero after q lags because MA models are based on forecast errors, and beyond q lags, there's no additional information to predict the current value. So combining both, the ACF of an ARMA(p, q) should inherit the geometric decline from the AR part and the zero after q lags from the MA part. That makes sense because the ACF incorporates both the AR and MA effects.

What about the PACF? I think the PACF is the partial autocorrelation function, which essentially removes the effect of the MA part. For AR models, the PACF decays geometrically as well, just like the ACF, but it doesn't cut off at a certain lag because it's only considering the AR component. However, when you have an MA component, the PACF for ARMA models behaves differently. 

Wait, actually, I might be mixing things up here. Let me think again. The PACF is related to the AR component because it's the correlation between the current value and the past values, excluding the MA part. So, if the process has an MA(q) component, then the PACF should eventually become zero after q lags because the MA component doesn't contribute beyond that point. Hmm, is that correct?

No, hold on. The PACF is used to identify the order of an AR model. For ARMA(p, q), the PACF will have p lags where the correlation is non-zero, and beyond that, it should be zero because the MA part doesn't add anything to the prediction beyond q lags. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, maybe not. I think the PACF for ARMA(p, q) actually decays geometrically just like the ACF does, but after a certain number of lags, the effect of the MA part causes the PACF to become zero. Let me try to recall.

I remember that the ACF for ARMA(p, q) is a combination of the AR and MA effects. It starts with a sharp decay from the AR part and then, after q lags, the MA part causes it to become zero. On the other hand, the PACF is similar to the ACF but without the MA component. So, the PACF would only show the AR part, which is p, and beyond p lags, it should be zero. Wait, but that doesn't match the options given.

Wait, the options are: A. Both ACF and PACF decline geometrically. B. ACF declines geometrically, PACF is zero after p lags. C. ACF declines geometrically, PACF is zero after q lags. D. Both ACF and PACF are zero after p and q lags respectively.

So, if I think about the ACF: since ARMA has both AR and MA components, the ACF will have the geometric decay from AR and then drop to zero after MA order q. So, the ACF is geometrically declining and zero after q lags.

For the PACF, since it's related to the AR component, I think it should decline geometrically as well, but maybe not necessarily be zero at any lag. Wait, no, because the PACF is the partial autocorrelation, which removes the effect of the MA part. So, in reality, for ARMA(p, q), the PACF will show p lags where the correlation is non-zero (geometric decay), and after that, it should be zero because the MA part has been accounted for.

But now I'm confused because I thought the PACF is used to identify the AR order, so it should have p non-zero lags, not necessarily zero after p. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to recall the properties more clearly.

For an AR model of order p, the ACF decays geometrically, and the PACF also decays geometrically up to p lags.

For an MA model of order q, the ACF is zero beyond q lags, and the PACF is also zero beyond q lags because the PACF is the same as the ACF when you have only MA.

But for an ARMA(p, q) model, the ACF will have the geometric decay from AR(p) but will also be zero beyond q lags because of the MA(q). So, the ACF is geometrically declining and zero after q lags. That's why option C is correct.

But what about the PACF? Since PACF is the partial autocorrelation function, which is similar to the ACF but without the MA component. So in ARMA(p, q), the PACF would be the same as the ACF of AR(p, q), which is a geometric decay. Wait, but that might not be correct because the PACF should be zero beyond p lags.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me refer to some properties.

I remember that in ARMA(p, q), the full ACF is a combination of the AR and MA effects. So, it decays geometrically for the first p lags, then drops to zero at lag q+1. Similarly, the PACF, which is the partial autocorrelation, is the same as the ACF but without the MA component. So, the PACF would be the ACF of the AR(p) model, which is geometrically declining, but since it's the partial autocorrelation, it should drop off after p lags because beyond that, the MA component has no effect. Hmm, so perhaps the PACF is zero after p lags.

Wait, now I'm really confused because if PACF is zero after p lags, that would suggest option B. But the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the concepts. Let me try to think more methodically.

Suppose we have an ARMA(p, q) process. Let’s denote the process as {X_t}.

The ACF of X_t is given by E[X_t X_{t-k}] for k = 0, 1, 2, ...

In an AR model, the ACF decays geometrically because each lag depends on the previous lag multiplied by a factor less than 1.

In an MA model, E[X_t X_{t-k}] is zero for k > q because the forecast errors are uncorrelated beyond q lags.

Therefore, for ARMA(p, q), the ACF will decay geometrically for k = 0, 1, ..., q, and then become zero for k > q.

Wait, but no, actually, the decay is continuous, not necessarily cutoff at q. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the ACF for AR(p) decays geometrically with period equal to the AR coefficient. For ARMA(p, q), the ACF is the sum of the ACF of AR(p) and the ACF of MA(q). The ACF of AR(p) is a decaying exponential, and the ACF of MA(q) is zero beyond q lags.

Therefore, the combined ACF for ARMA(p, q) will have a geometric decay for the first p lags and then drop to zero at lag q+1.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the ACF for ARMA(p, q) is the sum of the ACFs of AR(p) and MA(q). So, the ACF of AR(p) is a decaying exponential, and the ACF of MA(q) is 1 for k=0 and 0 for k>q.

Therefore, the ACF of ARMA(p, q) is the ACF of AR(p) for k=0 to q, and for k > q, it's the ACF of MA(q), which is zero.

Wait, that doesn't seem quite right because the ACF is a combination of both effects simultaneously.

Wait, maybe it's a bit more nuanced. The ACF of ARMA(p, q) is equal to the ACF of AR(p) plus the ACF of MA(q). So, for each lag k, the ACF is equal to the sum of the ACF from AR(p) and the ACF from MA(q).

So, for k from 0 to q, the ACF is equal to the ACF of AR(p) plus 1 (since MA(q) contributes 1 for k=0 and 0 otherwise). For k > q, the ACF is equal to the ACF of AR(p). But wait, that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, perhaps not. The ACF of ARMA(p, q) is actually a combination where the MA(q) adds a spike at lag 0, but beyond lag q, the ACF is dominated by the AR(p) component.

But actually, I think that's not exactly correct. Let me recall the formula.

The ACF for ARMA(p, q) is given by:

φ_k = α^k + β_1 α^{k-1} + β_2 α^{k-2} + ... + β_p α^{k - p}

where α is the AR coefficient and β_i are the MA coefficients.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, in some references, it's expressed that the ACF for ARMA(p, q) is the sum of a geometric decay (AR part) and the MA part, which is zero beyond q.

But I might be misapplying the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the ACF for ARMA(p, q) is the ACF of AR(p) if q=0, and the ACF of MA(q) if p=0. But when both p and q are positive, it's a combination.

Wait, maybe the correct way is that the ACF of ARMA(p, q) is the same as the ACF of AR(p) when q=0, and when q>0, the ACF is equal to the ACF of AR(p) plus the ACF of MA(q).

But the ACF of MA(q) is zero for all lags k > q.

Therefore, for lags k=0 to q, the ACF of ARMA(p, q) is the ACF of AR(p) plus 1 (because MA(q) contributes 1 at lag 0). For k > q, it is equal to the ACF of AR(p). But that doesn't quite make sense because the MA(q) should affect more than just lag 0.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Wold's theorem, which states that any stationary process can be represented as the sum of an AR process and a MA process. So, for ARMA(p, q), the ACF is the sum of the ACFs of AR(p) and MA(q). So, for each lag k, φ_k = φ_k^(AR) + φ_k^(MA). 

Since φ_k^(AR) is a decaying geometric sequence, and φ_k^(MA) is zero for k > q, then φ_k is the sum of a geometric decay and zero beyond q. So, the ACF will decay geometrically for k=0 to q, and remain as the AR decay for k > q.

Wait, but if φ_k^(AR) is a decaying exponential, and φ_k^(MA) is zero for k > q, then beyond k = q, the ACF is just the AR decay.

So, for ARMA(p, q), the ACF decays geometrically for all lags, but beyond lag q, it's just the AR part. So the entire ACF is a combination, but it doesn't necessarily become zero after q lags—it continues to decay but perhaps at a different rate?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If the ACF is the sum of two decays, one that persists beyond q and one that is zero beyond q, so the overall ACF beyond q is just the AR decay.

But wait, is that correct? Or does the MA part affect the decay rate beyond q?

I'm getting confused. Let me look for a different approach.

I remember that for AR models, the ACF is a geometric decay, and the PACF is also a geometric decay.

For MA models, the ACF is zero beyond q, and the PACF is also zero beyond q.

For ARMA(p, q), the ACF combines both. So, for k from 0 to p, the ACF is a combination of the AR and MA effects, but beyond p, it's just the AR decay? Or is it that beyond q, the MA part causes it to be zero?

Wait, I think I was wrong before. Let me try to think of the process.

If you have an ARMA(p, q), the process has both an AR(p) component and an MA(q) component. So, the ACF will have the AR decay for all lags, but the MA(q) component will cause the ACF to be zero beyond q lags.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the AR component should have an effect beyond any lags.

Wait, perhaps the ACF of ARMA(p, q) decays geometrically for all lags and is zero beyond q lags. But that can't be because AR processes have an infinite ACF that decays, but MA processes have zero beyond q. So how does it combine?

Wait, maybe the ACF of ARMA(p, q) is a combination where the first q lags have contributions from both AR and MA, and beyond that, only AR. But I think that's not the case because the MA(q) is a white noise process, so beyond q lags, the ACF is determined only by the AR(p) part. So, beyond q lags, the ACF should continue to decay.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should refer to the properties of ARMA models.

I think the key idea is that the ACF of ARMA(p, q) is equal to the ACF of AR(p) plus the ACF of MA(q). The ACF of AR(p) is a geometric decay, and the ACF of MA(q) is 1 at lag 0 and 0 beyond lag q. So, for lags k=0 to q, the ACF is the sum of a decaying exponential and 1. For lags beyond q, it's just the decaying exponential.

Therefore, the overall ACF is a combination, but it doesn't become zero beyond q lags—it decays, but just at a slightly different rate because of the MA component.

Wait, but that contradicts the initial thought that the ACF becomes zero after q lags. Maybe in reality, the ACF doesn't become zero but continues to decay, unlike the PACF.

Wait, no. Maybe if you take the PACF, which is the partial autocorrelation, that's different.

The PACF is equal to the ACF minus the contribution from the MA part. So, in ARMA(p, q), the PACF should be the same as the ACF of the AR(p) process, which is a geometric decay, but only up to lag p. Beyond that, it should be zero because the PACF is used to determine the AR order.

Wait, that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, the PACF of an ARMA(p, q) model is equal to the PACF of AR(p) because the PACF is a measure of the linear dependence on past observations, excluding the MA component. So, the PACF should decay geometrically up to p lags and then become zero.

But if that's the case, then the PACF is zero after p lags, and the ACF is a combination of geometric decay and zero after q lags.

But the correct answer is C, which says the ACF declines geometrically and the PACF is zero after q lags. That would mean that both ACF and PACF have properties determined by the higher order, q.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm mixing up ACF and PACF.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Let’s say p=1 and q=1. So, ARMA(1,1). In this case, the model is often called the AR(1) or simple moving average.

For AR(1), the ACF decays geometrically, say with coefficient ρ.

For MA(1), the ACF is 1 at lag 0 and 0 at lag 1.

So, for ARMA(1,1), the ACF would be ρ at lag 1 and 0 at lag 2.

Wait, actually, no. The ACF is the sum of the AR(1) and MA(1) ACFs.

Wait, for AR(1), the ACF is ρ^k.

For MA(1), the ACF is 1 for k=0 and 0 for k=1,2,...

So, for ARMA(1,1), the ACF would be ρ^k + δ_{k,0}, where δ_{k,0} is 1 if k=0 and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, for k=0, φ_0 = ρ^0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

For k=1, φ_1 = ρ^1 + 0 = ρ.

For k=2, φ_2 = ρ^2 + 0 = ρ^2.

And so on.

So, the ACF is 2
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about ARMA models, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. I remember that ARMA stands for Autoregressive Moving Average, and the parameters p and q determine the order of the model. Both p and q are integers greater than zero. 

The question is asking about the characteristics of the autocorrelation function (acf) and the partial autocorrelation function (pacf) for an ARMA(p,q) model. The options are A, B, C, D, each describing different behaviors of the acf and pacf.

Let me recall what I know about ARMA models. ARMA models are a combination of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models. The AR part represents the autoregressive process, where each term is a linear combination of previous terms, and the MA part represents the moving average process, where each term is a linear combination of random errors.

For an ARMA(p,q) model, the acf is a combination of the acf of an AR(p) model and the acf of an MA(q) model. Similarly, the pacf is a combination of the pacf of AR(p) and MA(q). 

I remember that for an AR(p) model, the acf decays geometrically with the lag, and the pacf becomes zero after p lags. For an MA(q) model, the acf is zero after q lags, and the pacf decays geometrically. 

So, when you combine both, the overall acf will have a geometric decay, just like the AR model, but the pacf will have a different behavior. Specifically, the pacf of an ARMA(p,q) model will have non-zero values only up to the minimum of p and q lags. 

Wait, let me think again. If p and q are different, the pacf will have non-zero values up to the smaller of p and q. But if they are equal, then the pacf will have non-zero values up to p (or q) lags. 

So, in an ARMA(p,q) model, the acf decays geometrically because both the AR and MA components have decaying acfs. The acf of the AR part decays geometrically, and the acf of the MA part is zero beyond q lags. But since the overall acf is a combination of these, it should decay geometrically as well.

On the other hand, the pacf is a bit different. The pacf of the AR part is zero after p lags, and the pacf of the MA part decays geometrically. So, the combined pacf will have non-zero values up to the minimum of p and q lags. But wait, no, that's not quite right.

Actually, the pacf for ARMA(p,q) is a sum of the individual pacfs. The AR(p) model has a pacf that is zero after p lags, and the MA(q) model has a pacf that decays geometrically. So, the combined pacf will have non-zero values only up to q lags if p > q, or only up to p lags if q > p. But actually, I think it's a combination that results in the pacf being non-zero up to min(p,q) lags.

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think about how the pacf is derived. The pacf can be calculated using the inverse filter and the forward filter. For ARMA(p,q), the inverse filter of the AR part results in a filter that annihilates the AR components, and the forward filter of the MA part leaves the MA components intact.

So, the combined effect is that the acf is a combination of the AR and MA acfs, and the pacf is a combination of the AR and MA pacfs. For the AR part, the acf decays geometrically and the pacf is zero after p lags. For the MA part, the acf is zero after q lags and the pacf decays geometrically.

Therefore, in the combined model, the acf will decay geometrically because both the AR and MA components contribute to it, but perhaps the decay rate is different? Wait, no, the decay rate is determined by the model. For AR(p), the acf decays at a rate determined by the AR coefficients, and for MA(q), the acf is zero after q lags. So the combined acf should still decay geometrically, similar to the AR part.

For the pacf, the combined model will have a pacf that is non-zero up to q lags because the MA(q) part has a decaying pacf, and after that, it's zero? Or does it have a different behavior?

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The ARMA model's acf is the sum of the AR acf and the MA acf. Since the AR acf decays geometrically and the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, the combined acf will still decay geometrically but will be zero beyond q lags only if the AR acf is negligible beyond that point. But actually, the combined acf will have contributions from both the AR and MA parts. The AR part continues to decay, while the MA part becomes zero.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me refer to my notes.

Wait, no, I think in the ARMA model, the overall acf is a combination of the AR and MA acfs, but the MA part is added to the AR acf. So, the MA acf is a spike at the MA lags, but when combined with the AR acf, which decays, the overall acf may have some characteristics from both. However, after the MA lags, the MA acf is zero, but the AR acf is still decaying. So, beyond MA lags, the acf is determined solely by the AR part, which continues to decay.

Therefore, the overall acf will have a decaying behavior, but perhaps with a different rate or a different starting point. But it's still decaying geometrically, just as in the AR(p) model. Because the MA(q) part adds a spike but doesn't affect the long-term decay. So, the acf still decays geometrically.

On the other hand, the pacf is the sum of the individual pacfs. The AR(p) model's pacf is zero after p lags, and the MA(q) model's pacf decays geometrically. So, the combined pacf will have contributions from both. For lags less than or equal to q, the pacf will have both the AR and MA contributions, but beyond that, only the MA contribution remains, which decays geometrically.

Wait, but after q lags, isn't the MA part's pacf zero? No, the MA(q) model's pacf decays geometrically, not becoming zero. So, the MA(q) model's pacf does not become zero after q lags; rather, its contribution is always decaying. But when combined with the AR(p) model, which has a pacf that becomes zero after p lags, how does that affect the overall pacf?

I think the key here is that the AR(p) model's pacf is zero after p lags, meaning that beyond p lags, the AR part doesn't contribute to the acf or pacf. The MA(q) model's acf is zero after q lags, but its pacf decays geometrically. So in the combined model, the acf will have a decaying behavior due to both AR and MA, but the pacf will have non-zero values up to p lags because the AR part is active up to p lags, and beyond that, only the MA part remains, which decays.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. The AR part's pacf is zero after p lags, so beyond p lags, only the MA part's contribution remains. But the MA(q)'s pacf decays geometrically, so the combined pacf will have non-zero values beyond p lags, but decaying.

But actually, no, because the MA(q) model's acf is zero beyond q lags, so perhaps the MA part doesn't contribute beyond q lags. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to recall the properties step by step.

1. For AR(p) model:
   - acf decays geometrically.
   - pacf is zero after p lags.

2. For MA(q) model:
   - acf is zero after q lags.
   - pacf decays geometrically.

3. For ARMA(p,q):
   - acf is the sum of AR acf and MA acf.
     - AR acf decays geometrically.
     - MA acf is zero beyond q lags.
     - So, combined, the acf decays geometrically, but beyond q lags, it's determined only by the AR acf, which continues to decay.

   - pacf is the sum of AR pacf and MA pacf.
     - AR pacf is zero after p lags.
     - MA pacf decays geometrically.
     - So, combined, the pacf will have non-zero values up to min(p,q) lags, but wait, no.

Wait, actually, the pacf is defined as the coefficient in the lag k for the acf. So, for an ARMA(p,q), the acf is:

acf_k = ar_k + ma_k

Where ar_k is the AR coefficient and ma_k is the MA coefficient.

Similarly, the pacf is the sum of the AR pacf and MA pacf:

pacf_k = (AR_pacf_k) + (MA_pacf_k)

But AR_pacf_k is zero for k > p, and MA_pacf_k decays geometrically.

So, for k > p, the AR part doesn't contribute, but the MA part does. So, the combined pacf will have MA_pacf_k for k > p, which decays geometrically. However, the MA_pacf_k is non-zero for all k, decaying as (1 - phi_m)^k, where phi_m is the moving average coefficient.

But wait, in the ARMA model, after the MA lags, the MA acf is zero, but the MA pacf is still decaying. So, for the overall acf, beyond MA lags, it's determined by the AR acf, but for the pacf, beyond MA lags, it's determined by the MA pacf.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the inverse filter and forward filter.

The ARMA model can be represented as:

y_t = AR(p) part + MA(q) part

Where AR(p) is a linear combination of past y's, and MA(q) is a linear combination of past residuals (from the AR part). 

When you take the acf of the ARMA model, it's the sum of the acf from the AR part and the acf from the MA(q) part. The AR part's acf decays geometrically, and the MA part's acf is zero beyond q lags. So, the combined acf will have a decaying behavior due to the AR part, but beyond q lags, it's just the AR acf, which continues to decay.

For the pacf, it's a bit more involved. The pacf can be computed using the inverse filter and then the forward filter. The inverse filter annihilates the AR part, leaving only the MA part, whose acf is zero beyond q lags. Then, the forward filter is applied, which adds back the AR part, but only up to p lags. 

So, the combined effect is that the pacf is the MA pacf for all lags, but the AR part is added back up to p lags. However, the MA part's acf is zero beyond q lags, so when you inverse filter, you get the MA part, which has a decaying acf. Then, forward filtering adds back the AR part, but only up to p lags. 

Therefore, the combined pacf will have the decaying behavior of the MA part, but for lags beyond p, only the MA part remains, but the MA part's acf is zero beyond q lags. So, if q > p, beyond p lags, the MA part's acf is zero, so the overall pacf would be zero beyond p lags. If p > q, beyond q lags, the MA part's acf is zero, but the AR part's acf is still contributing, but since we added it back up to p lags, beyond q lags, the pacf is determined by the MA part, which is decaying.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about specific examples.

Suppose we have ARMA(1,1), which is the ARMA model with p=1 and q=1. This is the ARMA(1,1) model, which is equivalent to a random walk model.

For this model, the acf decays geometrically, but has a unit root, so it doesn't decay to zero. However, in practice, it's often considered to decay geometrically in the limiting case.

The pacf for ARMA(1,1) is 1 for lag 1 and then decreases geometrically. Wait, no, for ARMA(1,1), the pacf is 1 at lag 1, and then decays? Or is it 1 at lag 1 and then zero?

Wait, no, let me recall. For AR(1), the pacf is 1 at lag 1 and zero elsewhere. For MA(1), the pacf is 1 at lag 1 and decays as (1 - phi)^k for higher lags. So, when combined, the ARMA(1,1) model's pacf is 1 at lag 1 (AR contribution) and 1 at lag 1 (MA contribution), but actually, after inverse filtering, it's just the MA part, which decays, and then forward filtering adds back the AR part.

Wait, I think I need to step back.

In general, for ARMA(p,q), the acf is a combination of AR and MA acfs. The AR acf is non-zero for all lags and decays geometrically. The MA acf is zero beyond q lags. Therefore, the combined acf will have a decaying trend similar to the AR model but will be zero beyond q lags only if the AR acf is negligible beyond that point. But actually, the AR acf continues to decay beyond q lags. So, the acf will decline geometrically but will be zero beyond q lags? Wait, no, because the AR acf isn't zero beyond q lags.

Wait, maybe I'm misapplying. The MA acf is zero beyond q lags, but the AR acf is still non-zero and continues to decay. So, the combined acf will have a decaying behavior from the AR part, but beyond q lags, it's just the AR acf. So, it won't be zero beyond q lags, unless the AR acf is also zero beyond q lags, which it isn't.

So, I think the acf will decline geometrically but not necessarily become zero beyond q lags. So, the acf will decline geometrically, similar to the AR model, but beyond q lags, it's determined by the AR part.

For the pacf, as per the inverse filter and forward filter method, the AR part's contribution is added back only up to p lags. So, for lags beyond p, only the MA part contributes, which has a decaying acf. But since the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, the overall acf is zero beyond q lags, but the pacf beyond p lags is determined by the MA part's acf, which is zero beyond q lags. 

Wait, I think I'm mixing acf and pacf here.

The acf is a sum of AR and MA acfs, so beyond q lags, it's just the AR acf.

The pacf is a sum of AR and MA pacfs. The AR pacf is zero beyond p lags, so beyond p lags, the pacf is only the MA pacf. The MA pacf decays geometrically, so the overall pacf beyond p lags decays geometrically.

But wait, the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, so the MA pacf beyond q lags is also zero? No, the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, but the MA pacf is the coefficient in the lag k for the acf, which is not necessarily zero beyond q lags.

Wait, the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, which means that the MA part doesn't contribute to the acf beyond q lags. Therefore, the overall acf beyond q lags is determined solely by the AR part.

However, the MApacf is different. The MA pacf decays geometrically, so beyond q lags, the MA pacf is still decaying, but the MA acf is zero beyond q lags. So, the overall pacf beyond q lags is the AR pacf (which is zero beyond p lags) plus the MA pacf (which decays). So, if p > q, then beyond q lags, the AR pacf is zero, so the overall pacf beyond q lags is just the MA pacf, which decays. If p < q, beyond p lags, the AR pacf is zero, but the MA pacf continues to decay, but since the MA acf is zero beyond q lags, the MA part's effect on the acf is gone beyond q lags.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should look at the definition.

In ARMA(p,q), the acf is:

acf_k = ar_k + ma_k

Where ar_k is from the AR model and ma_k from the MA model.

For the AR model, ar_k is non-zero for all k and decays geometrically.

For the MA model, ma_k is non-zero for 1 to q and ma_k = 0 for k > q.

Therefore, the combined acf will have ar_k for all k, and ma_k for k=1 to q. So, the acf will be a combination of both, but beyond q lags, it's just the AR acf.

Similarly, for the pacf, we have:

pacf_k = (AR pacf
[overthinking]
Alright, let's tackle this multiple-choice question about ARMA(p, q) models. Hmm, I remember that ARMA stands for Autoregressive Moving Average, and both p and q are the orders of the model, right? So p is the order of the autoregressive part, and q is the order of the moving average part.

The question is about the properties of the autocorrelation function (acf) and the partial autocorrelation function (pacf). Let me recall: the acf for an ARMA model should exhibit exponential decay if the model is stationary, which it is here since p and q are positive integers. So the acf should decline geometrically, which I think is what option A and C are suggesting.

Now, the pacf. For an ARMA(p, q) model, the pacf should be zero after the maximum lag, which is the larger of p and q. Wait, is that right? Or is it that after the order of the AR part and the MA part? Let me think. So, in an AR model of order p, the pacf will be zero after p lags. In an MA model of order q, the pacf will be zero after q lags. But when you combine them into an ARMA model, does the pacf become zero after p lags or q lags?

Let me recall the properties. The acf for ARMA(p, q) decays geometrically because of the moving average component, which introduces the damping factor. The pacf, on the other hand, will have a certain number of non-zero lags depending on the orders p and q. The maximum lag where the pacf is non-zero is the minimum of p and q. Wait, is that correct? Or is it the maximum?

Wait, no. Let me think more carefully. For the AR part, the pacf will have p non-zero lags, and for the MA part, the pacf will have q non-zero lags. But when combined into an ARMA(p, q), the overall pacf will have non-zero lags up to the minimum of p and q. Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, maybe the pacf will have non-zero lags up to the minimum of p and q. Wait, actually, no. Let me consider a specific example: suppose p=2 and q=3. Then, the AR part will contribute to non-zero pacf up to lag 2, and the MA part will contribute up to lag 3. So the combined pacf will have non-zero lags up to the minimum of p and q, which is 2 in this case? Or maybe it's up to the maximum? Hmm, I might be getting confused.

Wait, actually, when you have an ARMA(p, q) model, the pacf will have non-zero values up to the maximum of p and q. Let me think: if you have an AR(1) model, which is a special case of ARMA(1,0), the pacf is non-zero only at lag 1. If you have an MA(q) model, like ARMA(0,q), the pacf is non-zero up to lag q. So when you combine them, the pacf should have the union of both? So it would have non-zero lags up to the maximum of p and q.

Wait, no. Wait, in ARMA(p, q), the impulse response is a combination of the AR and MA components. Maybe the pacf will have non-zero lags up to the maximum of p and q.

Alternatively, let me recall the formula for the pacf in ARMA models. The pacf for ARMA(p, q) is the same as the acf of the AR(p, q) component, which is a combination of an AR(p) and MA(q). So the pacf will have non-zero lags from 1 to the maximum of p and q.

Wait, is that true? For example, in the ARMA(1,1) model, the pacf is non-zero at lags 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, that can't be right because in ARMA(1,1), the model is (1 - φB)(1 - θB) = 1 - (φ + θ)B + (φθ)B². So the acf decays geometrically, and the pacf would have a peak at lag 1 and decay geometrically afterwards. So the pacf is non-zero at all lags, but decays. So that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, no. In ARMA(1,1), the acf is a combination of the AR(1) acf and MA(1) acf. For AR(1), the acf at lag k is φ^k, and for MA(1), it's θ^k. So the combined acf is (φ + θ)φ^{k-1} for k=1, and (φ + θ)θ^{k-1} for k>1. So actually, the acf decays exponentially with rate min(φ, θ), so it's a combination but still decays. The pacf, on the other hand, for ARMA(1,1) is a two-sided function, but for the one-sided pacf, it's the same as the acf. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no. The pacf is the one-sided moving average of the acf. So for ARMA(p, q), the pacf is defined as (1/q) * sum_{k=1}^q acf(k). But actually, no, that's not exactly correct. Wait, the pacf is computed as the moving average of the acf over the MA(q) lags. So for ARMA(p, q), the pacf at lag m is the moving average of the acf at lags m, m+1, ..., m+q-1. So the non-zero lags of the pacf depend on when this moving average is non-zero.

But in the case of AR(p), the pacf is zero after lag p, and in MA(q), the pacf is zero after lag q. So in ARMA(p, q), the combined pacf will have non-zero lags up to the maximum of p and q. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose p=1 and q=2. So ARMA(1,2). The acf should decline geometrically because of the MA(2) component. The pacf, I think, in this case, will have non-zero lags up to the maximum of p and q, which is 2. So at lag 1, it's non-zero, and lag 2 is also non-zero, but lag 3 and beyond are zero. Wait, no, actually, for ARMA(p, q), the pacf is non-zero up to the maximum lag of p + q?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the definition. The partial autocorrelation function for ARMA(p, q) is defined as:

pacf(m) = (1/q) * sum_{k=1}^q acf(m + k - 1) for m = 1, 2, ..., q.

After that, the pacf is zero for m > q.

Wait, no, actually, the definition is that for lags m = 1, 2, ..., q, the pacf is an average of the acf from lag m up to lag m + q -1. But since the acf decays geometrically, as you take the average, it will also decay, but not necessarily be zero after q lags.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's refer back to properties of ARMA models. For an ARMA(p, q) model, the acf decays geometrically because of the MA(q) component. The pacf, on the other hand, will have a finite number of non-zero lags. Specifically, for ARMA(p, q), the pacf will be zero after the maximum lag of p and q. Wait, but that's not quite right either.

Wait, let me think about the Cramér-Rao properties. In AR(p), the pacf is zero after p lags. In MA(q), the acf is zero after q lags, but the pacf is non-zero up to q lags. So in ARMA(p, q), the combined model, the pacf will have non-zero lags up to the maximum of p and q. But actually, no, the maximum lag where the pacf is non-zero is the minimum of p and q.

Wait, this is conflicting. Let me try a different approach. Let's recall that for an ARMA(p, q) model, the impulse response function is a combination of an AR(p) impulse response and an MA(q) impulse response. The AR part has an impulse that decays after p lags, and the MA part has an impulse that decays after q lags. So the combined impulse response will have a decay rate determined by the minimum of the AR and MA decay rates, but the number of non-zero lags is the maximum of p and q.

But wait, no. The acf is related to the impulse response, but the pacf is related to the cross-correlation. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the generating function.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ARMA(p, q) model, the acf is geometrically declining because of the MA component, which introduces the damping factor. The pacf, however, will have a finite number of non-zero lags. Specifically, the non-zero lags of the pacf depend on both p and q. For lags up to the minimum of p and q, both AR and MA contribute, so the pacf will have non-zero values. Beyond that, only the larger order contributes, but since both AR and MA have decaying acfs, the combined pacf will eventually become zero after the larger lag.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me consider the case where p=1 and q=2. Then, the model is AR(1) + MA(2). The acf should still decline geometrically because of the MA(2). The pacf, in this case, should be zero after the maximum lag of p, which is 1, but that contradicts because the MA(q) part would have non-zero pacf up to lag 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to refer to the formula for the pacf in ARMA models. The partial autocorrelation function for ARMA(p, q) is the same as the acf of the AR(p, q) component. So the acf for AR(p) is φ^k for k=1,...,p, and the acf for MA(q) is θ^k for k=1,...,q. The combined acf is a combination of these, so it decays with rate min(φ, θ), which is why it decays geometrically.

But the pacf is different. The pacf for AR(p) is zero after lag p, and for MA(q), the pacf is zero after lag q. So in the combined model, the pacf will be non-zero up to the maximum of p and q. Wait, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, let me think again. For AR(p), thepacf is zero after lag p, and for MA(q), the pacf is non-zero up to lag q. So in the combined model, the pacf will have the union of both, so up to the maximum of p and q. So the pacf will have non-zero lags up to the larger of p and q.

But in the answer, the correct option is C: acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags. Hmm, that suggests that after q lags, the pacf becomes zero. But if p > q, wouldn't the pacf from the AR part still have non-zero lags beyond q?

Wait, I think I need to clarify this. Let's look up the properties. For an ARMA(p, q) model:

- The acf decays geometrically because of the MA(q) term.

- The pacf will have non-zero values up to the maximum lag of p and q. Wait, no. The pacf in ARMA(p, q) is the same as the acf of the AR(p) component, which is zero after p lags, but the MA(q) component affects the acf, not the pacf.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The acf is influenced by both AR and MA, but the pacf is influenced differently. For AR(p), the pacf is zero after p lags, and for MA(q), the acf is zero after q lags, but the pacf for MA(q) is non-zero up to q lags.

So in ARMA(p, q), the acf will have exponential decay because of the MA(q) term, which is the same as saying the acf decays geometrically. The pacf, on the other hand, for lags up to the maximum of p and q, will have contributions from both AR and MA, but after that, it's zero.

But wait, that can't be. Let me think of an example. Suppose p=3, q=2. Then, the ARMA(3,2) model. The acf should decline geometrically because of MA(2). The pacf, since the AR part has order 3, the pacf should be zero after 3 lags, regardless of the MA(q). But wait, no, the pacf is a combination of both.

Wait, no, the pacf for ARMA(p, q) is defined as the partial autocorrelation function of the ARMA model, which is equivalent to the acf of the AR(p, q) component. So if you have AR(p) and MA(q), the combined acf is a combination of AR and MA acfs.

But the pacf, I think, is not directly the same as the acf. Let me recall the relationship between acf and pacf. The acf is the sum of the pacf over all lags. So the pacf is a sort of moving average of the acf.

Wait, for AR models, the pacf is zero after p lags, and for MA models, the acf is zero after q lags. For ARMA(p, q), the acf is a combination of the AR and MA acfs, so it decays geometrically. The pacf, however, is a moving average of the acf over q lags. So the pacf will have non-zero values as long as the acf is non-zero in those lags.

Since the acf decays geometrically, the moving average will also decay. But when does the pacf become zero? It would become zero after the moving average is zero. Since the acf decays geometrically, the moving average of q lags will also decay, but how many lags until it becomes zero? That depends on the decay rate.

Wait, but geometric decay means that each lag is a multiple of the previous one. So, if the acf is decaying geometrically with rate r, then the moving average would be a combination of r, r^2, ..., r^q, scaled by 1/q. So the pacf will decay geometrically as well, but with a rate depending on r and q.

However, in terms of the number of non-zero lags, for the pacf, it's not about when it becomes zero, but that it's a combination of the acf over q lags. So the pacf will be non-zero for all lags up to the maximum of p and q, but the question is asking about when the pacf becomes zero.

Wait, the options are about whether the acf and pacf become zero after certain lags. So, the acf in an ARMA model decays geometrically, meaning it never becomes exactly zero, but approaches zero asymptotically. However, in practical terms, after a certain number of lags, the acf is negligible.

Similarly, for the pacf, it depends on the model. In AR models, the pacf is zero after p lags. In MA models, the acf is zero after q lags, but the pacf is non-zero up to q lags. In ARMA models, the acf is a combination, but the pacf is influenced by both. However, I think that in ARMA(p, q), the pacf is zero after the maximum lag of p and q.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the pacf is a moving average of the acf, which is non-zero at all lags, just decaying. So the pacf will also be non-zero for all lags, but decaying. So it never becomes zero, just approaches zero.

Wait, that can't be right. If p=1 and q=1, the ARMA(1,1) model, the pacf is the same as the acf, which decays geometrically, never becoming zero. So the statement that the pacf is zero after q lags is incorrect because the pacf is non-zero for all lags, just decaying.

But wait, the options are:

A. acf declines geometrically, pacf declines geometrically.

B. acf declines geometrically, pacf zero after p lags.

C. acf declines geometrically, pacf zero after q lags.

D. acf zero after p lags, pacf zero after q lags.

From what I recall, in AR models, the acf decays geometrically (if stationary) and the pacf is zero after p lags. In MA models, the acf is zero after q lags, and the pacf decays but doesn't become zero. In ARMA(p, q), the acf decays geometrically because of the MA term, and the pacf is a combination of both, but the pacf is zero after the maximum lag of p and q? Or is it that the pacf is zero after the minimum lag?

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the properties. For ARMA(p, q), the acf is geometrically declining because of the MA(q) component. The pacf, on the other hand, will have a finite number of non-zero lags, specifically up to the maximum of p and q. But wait, in AR(p
