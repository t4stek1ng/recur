[overthinking]
Alright, let me see. So, the problem is about the speeds of different gadgets: a whirligig, a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit. It says a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Then, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. We're given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and we need to figure out how fast the whirligig spins. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to understand the relationships here. It mentions three gadgets: whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. Each has a spinning speed, and their speeds are related to each other through some multipliers. So, we have to set up these relationships and then solve for the speed of the whirligig.

Let me denote the speed of the thingamabob as T. That seems like a good starting point. So, T is the base speed, and then the others are multiples of T. 

The problem states that a whirligig spins five times as fast as a thingamabob. So, if the thingamabob is T, then the whirligig's speed would be 5 * T. Let me write that down:

Whirligig speed (W) = 5 * T.

Okay, that's straightforward. Then, it says a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Hmm, "spins eleven times faster"—so does that mean 11 times the speed, or 11 times as fast? In most contexts, when something spins "faster," it means its speed is multiplied by that number. So, the whatchamacallit's speed would be 11 * T. 

Wait, but hold on. If the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, does that mean it's 11 times the speed or 11 times the rotational speed? Hmm, in terms of linear speed or angular speed? Wait, the problem gives a linear speed in meters per second, so I think we're talking about linear speed here. So, it's 11 times the linear speed. So, if the thingamabob is T, the whatchamacallit is 11 * T. Got it.

So, summarizing:

- Thingamabob speed: T
- Whirligig speed: 5T
- Whatchamacallit speed: 11T

Now, we are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up an equation:

11T = 121 m/s.

So, solving for T:

T = 121 / 11.

Let me compute that. 121 divided by 11 is 11, because 11*11 is 121. So, T is 11 m/s.

Now, since the whirligig's speed is 5T, we can plug in T:

W = 5 * 11 = 55 m/s.

Wait, but the problem says the correct answer is 82. Hmm, so that's conflicting with my result. Did I interpret the problem correctly?

Let me go back and check.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." So, W = 5T.

"A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, Wc = 11T.

Wait, if Wc is 11T, and Wc is given as 121 m/s, then T is 121 / 11 = 11. Then, W = 5*11 = 55 m/s. Hmm, that's 55, but the answer is supposed to be 82.

Hmm, so maybe I misinterpreted the relationship. Let me think again.

"A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob."

Does "eleven times faster" mean 11T or 11 times the rate? Wait, sometimes when people say "faster," they might mean the rate of increase or something else. But in this context, it's about spinning speed, so I think it's 11 times T.

Alternatively, maybe "eleven times faster than a thingamabob" could be interpreted as 11T + T, which is 12T. Hmm, but that would be 12 times faster. Wait, no, "times faster" usually implies multiplication, not addition.

Wait, another thought: maybe the rotational speed is meant here, but perhaps the linear speed is different.

Wait, the problem says it spins at 121 meters per second. So, perhaps the thingamabob's linear speed is T, and the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster, so its linear speed is 11T, which is 121 m/s. So, T is 11 m/s, and the whirligig is 5*11=55 m/s. So, 55.

But if the answer is 82, maybe my initial model is wrong.

Wait, let me see. Maybe the "speed" here is angular speed, not linear. If that's the case, we have to convert angular speed to linear speed to get the answer in m/s. So, perhaps I need to consider that.

Wait, but the problem gives a linear speed (meters per second) for the whatchamacallit, so if we're comparing angular speeds, we might need to calculate based on radius or something. But the problem doesn't provide any information about the radii or anything. So, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, hold on. The problem says a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If it's talking about angular velocity, then if the whatchamacallit is spinning eleven times faster, its angular speed is eleven times that of the thingamabob. But if it's talking about linear speed, then linear speed is proportional to angular speed times the radius (v = ωr). So, if we don't know the radius, perhaps we can't directly relate, but the problem gives a linear speed, so I think it's safe to assume it's linear speed.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, let's read the problem again.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin? Why the correct answer is: 82?"

Wait, so perhaps the thingamabob's spinning speed is five times the whatchamacallit's speed? Wait, no, the first statement is "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." So, W = 5T.

Then, "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, Wc = 11T.

But if Wc is 121 m/s, then T is 11, and W is 55. So, that's 55, not 82.

Hmm. Maybe the wording is that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, meaning Wc = 11*(Wc of thingamabob). So, if Wc is eleven times that of thingamabob, then yes, 11T. So, but same result.

Wait, but maybe I misread the first part. If a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so W = 5T.

But if the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster than a thingamabob, then Wc = 11T.

Given that Wc = 121, so T = 121 / 11 = 11. Then, W = 5*11=55.

Hmm, so 55, not 82. So, why is the correct answer 82?

Wait, perhaps the problem is in terms of radians per second or something else? Or maybe the spinning speed is in terms of revolutions per second?

Wait, but the problem gives the speed in meters per second, so it's linear speed, which is v = ωr. So, if the angular speed is higher, for the same radius, the linear speed is higher. But the problem does not specify that they have the same radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the thingamabob and the whatchamacallit have different radii, and the rotational speed is given, so we need to relate their linear speeds.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the radii or anything else, so I don't think we can use that. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe "spins eleven times faster" is referring to revolutions per minute, not linear speed? Hmm, but the given speed is in linear units, meters per second.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is a trick question where the thingamabob is spinning at 121 meters per second, but the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster? Wait, no, the problem says a whatchamacallit spins at 121 m/s.

Wait, let me check the original problem again:

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin? Why the correct answer is: 82?"

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, meaning that the whatchamacallit's speed is eleven times the speed of the thingamabob, but the thingamabob's speed is not given. Wait, but the whatchamacallit's speed is given as 121 m/s, so maybe we need to find the thingamabob's speed and then use that to find the whirligig's speed.

So, let me write that again.

Let T be the speed of the thingamabob.

Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11T, and that's given as 121 m/s.

So, 11T = 121 => T = 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

Then, the speed of the whirligig is 5T = 5*11 = 55 m/s.

Hmm, 55 is not 82. So, is the problem misinterpreted?

Alternatively, is there another way to interpret "eleven times faster than a thingamabob"?

Maybe "eleven times as fast as" is 11T, but sometimes people say "faster than" as a rate, not a multiplier.

Wait, for example, if a car goes 60 mph and it's 10 times faster than another car going 6 mph, that would mean 60 = 6*10. So, yes, 10 times faster in that context is a multiplier.

Similarly, if a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, it's 11 times the speed.

So, if Wc = 11T, and Wc = 121, T = 11, W = 55. So, that's 55.

But 55 is not 82. So, maybe the thingamabob is 11 times the speed of the whatchamacallit? No, the problem says the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the thingamabob is spinning at 121 m/s, and the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster. So, perhaps Wc = 11*T, but T is given as 121, so Wc = 11*121, which is 1331, which is way too big.

Wait, but the problem says a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, I think that is the given value, so it's 11T=121. So, T=11, W=55.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the multiplier is in the other direction. Maybe the whatchamacallit is 11 times the speed of the thingamabob, so Wc = 11T, but if the thingamabob is something else.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem is that the whirligig is five times the speed of the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit is eleven times the speed of the thingamabob, so both are multiples of the thingamabob's speed. Then, if the whatchamacallit is 121, then as before, T=11, and the whirligig is 55.

But again, that's 55, not 82.

Alternatively, perhaps the word "faster" is being used differently, like the rate of change of speed or something else? But that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so W = 5T.

A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so Wc = 11T.

But also, the problem says "a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second." So, if Wc = 11T = 121, so T = 11. Then, W = 5*11 = 55.

Hmm, not 82.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the problem. Maybe it's a chain: whirligig is five times a thingamabob, and whatchamacallit is eleven times the whirligig? Then, we could have Wc = 11W.

But, the problem says "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, it's directly relating to the thingamabob, not through the whirligig.

So, unless it's a multi-step relationship, but that would be unnecessarily complicated, and the problem doesn't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps it's an English language issue. Maybe "spins eleven times faster" is referring to a rate of spinning, not a multiplier. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the thingamabob is spinning at 121 m/s, and the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster. So, if T is the thingamabob's speed, then Wc = 11T = 121 => T=11. Then, W=5*11=55.

Still getting 55.

Wait, maybe "spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob" is referring to the ratio between their angular velocities, but we need to convert angular velocity to linear.

But since the problem gives a linear speed, I think that's not necessary.

Wait, but if we think of angular velocity, ω, then ω is related to linear velocity by v = ωr.

But if we don't know the radii, we can't relate the angular velocities directly.

Wait, but maybe all three gadgets have the same radius? Then, v = ωr, so if their linear speeds are given, we can find their angular speeds.

But the problem only gives the whatchamacallit's linear speed, and the rest are in terms of multiples of the thingamabob's speed.

Wait, okay, maybe I need to introduce angular velocities here.

Let me try:

Let ω_T be the angular speed of the thingamabob.

Then, the angular speed of the whirligig, ω_W = 5ω_T (because it spins five times as fast).

Similarly, the angular speed of the whatchamacallit, ω_Wc = 11ω_T.

Then, since v = ωr, for the whatchamacallit, 121 = ω_Wc * r.

But we don't know the radius r. If we assume all have the same radius, then 121 = ω_Wc * r, and for the thingamabob, T = ω_T * r.

But the problem gives v for the whatchamacallit, but not for the thingamabob, so without more information, I can't relate r.

Wait, but if we don't know r, then perhaps we can't find the whirligig's speed in meters per second. Maybe the problem wants the angular speed? Hmm, but the given answer is 82 m/s, which is a linear speed.

Alternatively, maybe the units are not in meters per second but rotations per second or something else. But 82 is a number, not a unit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I misread the given data. Let me check again.

It says: "A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second." So, that's the speed. So, 121 m/s.

Given that, and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so 11T = 121, so T=11 m/s.

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 5T=55 m/s.

Hmm, 55 is nowhere near 82.

Wait, is there a possibility that the thingamabob's speed is 5 times the whatchamacallit's speed? So, if T = 5Wc, then Wc = 121, so T = 5*121 = 605. Then, the whirligig is 5T = 5*605=3025. That's way too big.

Alternatively, maybe the whatchamacallit is 11 times the thingamabob, and the thingamabob is 5 times the whatchamacallit. So, Wc =11T, T=5Wc. Then, Wc=11*5Wc=55Wc. Which would mean Wc=0, which is not possible. So, that's a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a translation issue. Maybe the word "faster" is being misused. In some contexts, "faster" can mean the same as "as fast as," but in this case, it's given as a multiplier.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the "speed" is in terms of rotations per minute, and the linear speed is being conflated with angular speed. So, for example, if a thingamabob spins at 60 revolutions per minute, its linear speed would be, say, 60*r*2π/60 = 2πr per second. But again, without knowing r, I can't compute it.

Wait, but the problem gives the linear speed, so I think that approach is unnecessary.

Wait, maybe the "five times the speed" is in terms of power or torque, but the problem uses the word "speed," which in physics usually refers to linear speed unless specified otherwise.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the "speed" is in terms of acceleration, but that doesn't make much sense because
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out how fast a whirligig spins based on the information given. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem mentions a few different devices: a whirligig, a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit. The relationships between their spinning speeds are given, so I need to translate those into mathematical equations.

It says, "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." Let me denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( V_t \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whirligig, which I'll call \( V_w \), is five times that. So, \( V_w = 5 \times V_t \). Got that.

Next, it mentions, "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." Using similar notation, if the speed of a thingamabob is \( V_t \), then the speed of a whatchamacallit, \( V_wc \), should be eleven times \( V_t \). So, \( V_wc = 11 \times V_t \). That seems straightforward.

Then, the problem gives me a specific speed for the whatchamacallit: "A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second." So, \( V_wc = 121 \) m/s. Since I know that \( V_wc = 11 \times V_t \), I can plug this value in to find \( V_t \).

Let me write that out:

\( 11 \times V_t = 121 \) m/s.

To solve for \( V_t \), I can divide both sides by 11:

\( V_t = \frac{121}{11} \) m/s.

Calculating that, 121 divided by 11 is 11. So, \( V_t = 11 \) m/s.

Now, since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, I can find \( V_w \) by multiplying \( V_t \) by 5:

\( V_w = 5 \times V_t \).

Substituting \( V_t \) as 11 m/s:

\( V_w = 5 \times 11 \) m/s.

That equals 55 m/s. Hmm, wait, but the problem states that the correct answer is 82. Did I do something wrong?

Let me double-check my equations. Maybe I misread the relationships.

The problem says, "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." So, \( V_w = 5 V_t \). That seems right.

And, "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, \( V_wc = 11 V_t \). That also seems correct.

Given that \( V_wc = 121 \) m/s, so \( V_t = 121 / 11 = 11 \) m/s. Then, \( V_w = 5 \times 11 = 55 \) m/s.

But the answer is supposed to be 82. Hmm, maybe I'm interpreting the relationships backwards?

Wait, let's reconsider. Maybe the way the problem is phrased is different. It says a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, if a thingamabob spins at \( V_t \), then the whatchamacallit is 11 times that. So, yes, \( V_wc = 11 V_t \). That seems right.

Alternatively, could it mean that the whatchamacallit is spinning at 11 times the speed of the thingamabob, but in the opposite direction? No, the problem doesn't mention direction, so it's probably just speed.

Wait, but 11 times faster usually means speed multiplied by 11. So, 11 times the speed. So, I think my initial approach is correct.

But then why does the answer come out to 55 instead of 82? Let me check the calculation again.

\( V_wc = 11 V_t = 121 \).
Then, \( V_t = 121 / 11 = 11 \).
Then, \( V_w = 5 V_t = 5 * 11 = 55 \).

Hmm, unless they are considering something else. Maybe the phrase "eleven times faster" could mean something different? Like, eleven times the rate, which would include both speed and direction changes? But in the context of spinning speed, it's just about the rotational speed, so probably not.

Wait, 121 is 11 squared, so 11 times 11. So, yeah, 11 times V_t is 121, so V_t is 11.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the units? No, both are in meters per second, so units are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to something else, like the number of rotations per minute? But the problem says "spins at five times the speed", which would imply rotational speed, which is usually measured in revs per second or radians per second. But if it's meters per second, that's linear speed. Hmm, wait, that might be a problem.

Wait, hold on. Is the unit given for the whatchamacallit's speed 121 meters per second? So, is that linear speed or rotational speed? If it's a rotational speed, we need to convert that to linear speed or something else. But actually, when we talk about the speed of a spinner, it's usually rotational speed, which is the angular velocity. But the problem gives meters per second, which is linear. So, maybe they are referring to tangential speed?

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. If a whatchamacallit is spinning, its tangential speed is given by \( v = r \omega \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( \omega \) is the angular speed.

But the problem doesn't give us the radius. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe all the speeds are given as tangential speeds. So, if the whatchamacallit is at 121 m/s, and that's its tangential speed, then the thingamabob would have a tangential speed of 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

Then, the whirligig is 5 times as fast, so 5 * 11 = 55 m/s. But again, that would be 55, not 82.

Wait a second, maybe I misread the relationships.

Wait, the problem says "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." So, is that five times the linear speed, or five times the angular speed? If it's linear, then it's 5 * V_t. If it's angular, which is rotational speed, then it's 5 * angular speed.

But the problem is giving us the whatchamacallit's speed as 121 m/s, which is linear. So, perhaps all speeds are linear. Hmm.

Wait, if all are linear, then:

V_wc = 11 * V_t = 121 m/s. So, V_t = 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

Then, V_w = 5 * V_t = 55 m/s.

But 55 is not 82. So, perhaps the relationships are between angular speeds, not linear.

Let me try that approach.

If all speeds are angular speeds (in radians per second), then:

Whirligig angular speed = 5 times thingamabob's angular speed.

Whatchamacallit angular speed = 11 times thingamabob's angular speed.

But then, how do we get from angular speed to linear speed? Because we don't have the radius. Hmm.

Wait, unless all the devices have the same radius. But the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the ratio of their angular speeds, regardless of radius, but that would complicate things since linear speed depends on radius.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting us to compare angular speeds, not linear. So, if the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster in angular speed, and the whirligig is 5 times faster in angular speed, then maybe we need to express the linear speed ratios based on that?

But without knowing the radii, it's tricky. Unless they're assuming all have the same radius, but that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again:

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin? Why the correct answer is: 82?"

Wait, the correct answer is 82. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, so if the correct answer is 82, maybe I have to model it differently.

Is it possible that the "speed" is being measured in rotations per minute, or something else? But the units are given as meters per second, so it's linear.

Alternatively, perhaps the phrase "spins at five times the speed" is referring to the rotational speed (angular velocity), not linear.

So, if I consider angular speeds:

Let me denote:

V_w = 5 * V_t (angular speeds)

V_wc = 11 * V_t (angular speeds)

Given that V_wc is 121 m/s, but that's linear speed. So, tangential speed is 121 m/s, which is equal to r * ω, where ω is angular speed.

But without knowing the radius, I can't directly relate angular speed to linear speed.

Hmm, unless all the devices have the same radius. That might be a leap, but let's assume that for a moment. Let's say all have radius r.

Then, tangential speed = r * angular speed.

So, for the whatchamacallit:

r * V_wc = 121 m/s.

For the thingamabob:

r * V_t = V_t_linear.

For the whirligig:

r * V_w = 5 * r * V_t = 5 * V_t_linear.

But without knowing r, I can't directly compute V_t.

Wait, but if I consider all linear speeds, then:

V_wc = 11 * V_t_linear.

Given V_wc is 121, so V_t_linear = 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

Then, V_w = 5 * V_t_linear = 55 m/s.

Still 55, which isn't 82. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the relationships are not between linear speeds, but between angular speeds, but the given speed is a linear one.

So, V_wc_linear = r * V_wc_angular = 121 m/s.

Similarly, V_t_linear = r * V_t_angular.

V_w_linear = r * V_w_angular.

Given that V_w_angular = 5 * V_t_angular.

V_wc_angular = 11 * V_t_angular.

But still, we have multiple variables: V_t_angular, V_w_angular, r.

But we have three equations:

1) V_w_angular = 5 * V_t_angular

2) V_wc_angular = 11 * V_t_angular

3) V_wc_linear = r * V_wc_angular = 121 m/s

But that's all, unless we can relate V_w_linear to something.

But V_w_linear would be r * V_w_angular, which is 5 * r * V_t_angular.

But since we don't know r or V_t_angular, we can't find a numerical value. So, the problem is underspecified unless we assume all radii are the same.

Wait, if all have the same radius, say r, then we can express all linear speeds in terms of that radius.

From equation 3: r * V_wc_angular = 121 => V_wc_angular = 121 / r.

From equation 2: V_wc_angular = 11 * V_t_angular => 121 / r = 11 * V_t_angular => V_t_angular = (121 / r) / 11 = 11 / r.

From equation 1: V_w_angular = 5 * V_t_angular = 5 * (11 / r) = 55 / r.

Then, V_w_linear = r * V_w_angular = r * (55 / r) = 55 m/s.

Again, 55 m/s. Hmm, same result.

But the answer is supposed to be 82. So, maybe this isn't the right way.

Wait, another thought. Maybe "speed" refers to the number of rotations per second, which is angular speed, but we need to convert that to linear speed based on some radius.

But without the radius, we can't. Unless, perhaps, the radius is given implicitly.

Wait, perhaps the whatchamacallit, thingamabob, and whirligig are all the same size, so same radius. So, if that's the case, we can find the linear speed.

So, let's assume that all have the same radius r.

Given that:

Whatchamacallit's linear speed is 121 m/s, so:

V_wc_linear = r * V_wc_angular = 121.

Therefore, V_wc_angular = 121 / r.

Given that:

V_wc_angular = 11 * V_t_angular.

Similarly:

V_w_angular = 5 * V_t_angular.

So, V_w_linear = r * V_w_angular = 5 * r * V_t_angular.

But since V_t_angular = V_wc_angular / 11 = (121 / r) / 11 = 11 / r.

Therefore, V_w_angular = 5 * (11 / r) = 55 / r.

Therefore, V_w_linear = r * (55 / r) = 55 m/s.

Same result. So, 55 m/s.

But wait, the answer is supposed to be 82, so I'm missing something here.

Wait, another interpretation: Maybe "spins at five times the speed" refers to the number of rotations per second, but in linear terms.

But that doesn't make much sense. Rotations per second is angular speed, and linear speed is different.

Wait, unless it's a trick question where "speed" refers to something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are applied to linear speeds, but the question is about angular speeds, but the answer is given as 82, which is linear.

Wait, if 82 is the linear speed, then perhaps I need to relate angular speeds to linear speeds with a radius.

Wait, given that V_w_linear = r * V_w_angular.

But if I can find V_w_angular in terms of V_wc_angular, which is 121 / r.

But I don't know r.

Alternatively, maybe it's a proportion problem.

If the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, then the thingamabob is 1/11 the speed of the whatchamacallit.

Similarly, the whirligig is 5 times the thingamabob.

If all are linear speeds, then:

V_wc = 11 * V_t

V_w = 5 * V_t

So, V_w = 5 * (V_wc / 11) = (5/11) * V_wc.

Given that V_wc is 121, so V_w = (5/11) * 121 = 5 * 11 = 55.

Again, 55.

Wait, 5 * 11 is 55, which is the same as above.

But the answer is 82, so perhaps the ratios are being applied in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the thingamabob is spinning at a certain speed, and the whatchamacallit is spinning at 11 times that speed, but that's in addition to the thingamabob's speed?

No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is using "speed" as in the total number of revolutions per second? But that's again angular speed.

Alternatively, maybe the thingamabob has a speed, and both the whatchamacallit and whirligig have speeds relative to that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in terms of rotational speed, but with different radii, but if the radii are the same, then all would have linear speeds proportional to their angular speeds.

But again, if the radii are the same, then V_w is 55, not 82.

Wait, 82 is 121 * (5/11) = 55 * (something). Wait, 121 * (5/11) is 55, which isn't 82.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to reverse the ratios.

Wait, maybe the whirligig is five times the speed of the whatchamacallit, not the thingamabob.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin?"

So, no, it's five times the speed of a thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit is eleven times faster than the thingamabob.

So, that translates to:

V_w = 5 * V_t

V_wc = 11 * V_t

Given V_wc = 121 m/s, so V_t = 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

Thus, V_w = 5 * 11 = 55 m/s.

Alternatively, if I misread and thought that the whirligig is five times the speed of the whatchamacallit, then V_w = 5 * V_wc = 5 * 121 = 605, which is way too big. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way, but then the answer would be 605, which isn't 82.

Wait, maybe the relationships are between angular velocities, but we need to convert that to linear.

So, if V_w = 5 * V_t (angular), and V_wc = 11 * V_t (angular). Given that V_wc_linear = 121 = r * V_wc_angular.

So, V_wc_angular = 121 / r.

V_t_angular = V_wc_angular / 11 = 121 / (11 r) = 11 / r.

V_w_angular = 5 * V_t_angular =
