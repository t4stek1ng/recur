[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this question about how numbers are represented in 8-bit words, specifically about adding 109 and -42. The question is asking in which of the representations—One's complement, Two's complement, or Sign and magnitude—is the addition of these integers within range. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, and D. I, II, and III. The correct answer is supposed to be C, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what each of these representations means. 

**One's complement** is a method of representing negative numbers in binary. To get the one's complement of a positive number, you subtract it from the maximum value of the bit-length. For an 8-bit word, the maximum value is 127, so the one's complement of a number N is 127 - N. This is also known as the negation in one's complement form.

**Two's complement** is similar but slightly different. It's used to represent negative numbers in binary and is used in most computing systems. To get the two's complement, you first take the one's complement and then add 1. So, for a number N, the two's complement is (127 - N) + 1 = 128 - N. This is the standard way to represent negative numbers in systems that use two's complement.

**Sign and magnitude** representation is another way to represent numbers. Here, the highest bit (the 7th bit in 8-bit) is the sign bit. If it's 0, the number is positive; if it's 1, the number is negative. The other bits represent the magnitude, or the absolute value.

Okay, so the question is about adding 109 and -42 in each of these representations and whether the result is within range. I need to see if adding them in one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude gives a result that fits within an 8-bit word.

Let me start by converting both numbers to their respective representations in each system.

First, let's consider **two's complement**, since I know that's commonly used for negative numbers in computing.

In two's complement, -42 is represented as:

To find two's complement of 42 in 8 bits:
1. Find the one's complement: 127 - 42 = 85.
2. Add 1: 85 + 1 = 86.

So, -42 in two's complement is 86 in 8 bits.

Similarly, 109 is a positive number, so in two's complement, it's just 109.

So, adding 109 and -42 in two's complement is equivalent to adding 109 and 86.

Let me calculate that:

109 + 86 = 195.

But wait, in 8 bits, the maximum value is 127. So, 195 is larger than 127. Hmm, does that mean it's out of range?

Wait, hold on. In two's complement, the range is from -128 to 127. So, 195 is beyond 127, but in two's complement, numbers wrap around. So, we can represent 195 as 195 - 256 = -61. Because 256 is the next power of two after 128 (2^8). So, 195 - 256 = -61.

Is -61 within the two's complement range? Yes, because two's complement can represent from -128 to 127. So, -61 is well within that range.

So, in two's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives -61, which is within the 8-bit range.

Now, let's check One's complement.

In one's complement, -42 is 127 - 42 = 85.

109 is positive, so its one's complement is 127 - 109 = 18.

So, adding 18 (one's complement of 109) and 85 (one's complement of -42).

18 + 85 = 103.

Hmm, 103 is less than 127, so it's within the positive range. But wait, in one's complement, the numbers are usually considered unsigned. So, 103 is a valid 8-bit number.

But does that mean the addition is within range? Well, in one's complement, you can represent numbers from -127 to 0. So, if we interpret 103 as a signed number, it would be negative. Let me check:

In one's complement, numbers are considered negative if the highest bit is 1. So, 8 bits: the highest bit is the 7th bit. So, 103 in binary is:

Let me convert 103 to binary: 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 64 +32=96; 96+4=100; 100+2=102; 102+1=103. So, 64 +32 +4 +2 +1= 103. So, 64 is 2^6, so that would be:

64(1) 32(1) 16(0) 8(0) 4(1) 2(1) 1(1)

So, 64+32+4+2+1= 103.

So, the binary is 0111 0001? Wait, no. Wait, 64 is 6th bit, so in 8 bits, the binary is 01110001.

Wait, no, 64 is 2^6, which is the 7th bit (counting from 0). Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, 8 bits: bits 0 to 7.

64 is 2^6, which is bit 6.

So, 64: bit 6 is 1, others are 0.

32 is bit 5.

16 is bit 4.

8 is bit3.

4 is bit2.

2 is bit1.

1 is bit0.

So, 64=1 followed by 7 zeros: 10000000.

Wait, no. Wait, 64 in 8 bits is 01100000?

Wait, no. Wait, 8 bits can go from 0 to 127. Let me clarify.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in 8-bit one's complement, the numbers are from -127 to 0.

So, when we add 18 and 85, we get 103.

In one's complement, numbers are interpreted as signed and the maximum positive is 127, which is 01111111.

But 127 in one's complement is 0, because 127 is the complement of 0.

Wait, no, in one's complement, the maximum positive number is 127, which is all 1s.

But if we have 103, which is less than 127, how is it represented in one's complement?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that one's complement only represents negative numbers.

But in practice, one's complement is not commonly used for positive numbers, as two's complement is.

So, in one's complement, the way to represent positive numbers is by using two's complement.

Wait, so when we add 18 (one's complement of 109) and 85 (one's complement of -42), we get 103. But in one's complement, if we interpret this result as a signed number, it's actually negative.

Because in one's complement, the sign is determined by the highest bit.

So, 103 in one's complement is:

First, let's convert 103 to binary: 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 103, which is 0b01110001.

Wait, 64 is 6th bit, so 0b01110001 is 8 bits: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1.

So, the highest bit is 0. So, does that mean it's positive?

Wait, in one's complement, the sign is determined by the highest bit. If the highest bit is 0, it's positive; if it's 1, it's negative.

Wait, but 127 is all 1s, which is -1. So, 0b01110001 is a positive number.

But in one's complement, positive numbers are rarely used, as two's complement is the standard.

Wait, maybe if I add 18 and 85 in one's complement, I get 103, which is a positive number, but in one's complement, positive numbers are not typically represented. So, is 103 considered a valid result?

Wait, actually, in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 0. So, positive numbers aren't directly represented. However, if you add two numbers, you can get a result that's positive, but since the system is designed for signed numbers, you might need to handle the overflow.

Wait, perhaps in one's complement, adding two numbers that are within the range of -127 to 0 might result in a number that's positive, which would be outside the one's complement range. So, perhaps 103 is outside the one's complement range for signed numbers.

Wait, hold on. So, in one's complement, the maximum number you can have is 0, which is 00000000, and the minimum is -127, which is 11111111.

So, the range is 128 numbers, from -127 to 0.

If you add two numbers in one's complement, you can get a result that is beyond 0, but in one's complement, you can't represent positive numbers, so you have to handle it as a negative number with an overflow.

Wait, so perhaps adding 18 and 85 (which are both negative numbers in one's complement) gives 103, which is positive. But in one's complement, you can't represent positive numbers, so you have to treat 103 as a negative number.

Wait, how?

In one's complement, to get the negative of a number, you take the complement. So, if 103 is the result, to interpret it as a negative number, you take the one's complement of 103.

But 103 in one's complement is 127 - 103 = 24. So, 24 is the one's complement of 103, meaning that 103 is equivalent to -24 in one's complement.

But that seems confusing.

Alternatively, in one's complement, when adding numbers, if the sum exceeds 0, you can subtract 256 (the next power of two beyond 128) to get the equivalent negative number.

So, 103 - 256 = -153. Is -153 within the one's complement range? Yes, because -127 ≤ -153 < 0. Wait, no. -153 is less than -127, so it's outside the one's complement range.

Wait, hold on. So, adding 18 (which is 109's one's complement) and 85 (which is -42's one's complement) gives 103, which is positive. But in one's complement, you can't have positive numbers. So, you have to subtract 256 to make it negative. 103 - 256 = -153.

But -153 is less than -127, which is outside the one's complement range. So, in one's complement, the addition of 18 and 85 (which represent 109 and -42) results in a number outside the representable range.

Therefore, in one's complement, the addition is not within range.

Wait, that seems contradictory to my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the concepts.

Let me try another approach: maybe adding two numbers in one's complement without considering the sign.

In one's complement, addition is similar to binary addition without considering the sign, but you have to account for overflow.

But in one's complement, overflow is dealt with by discarding it, but since it's a signed system, you can get incorrect results.

Wait, so adding 18 and 85:

18 + 85 = 103. But in one's complement, 103 is outside the 8-bit range for signed numbers (which is -127 to 0). So, to get the correct sum, you have to consider that in one's complement, 103 as a signed number is actually -24, but that's not correct because 103 is 24 more than 79 (wait, no). Maybe this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps in one's complement, adding two negative numbers (since both 18 and 85 are one's complements of positive numbers) would give a result that's beyond the negative range.

Wait, 18 is one's complement of 109, so 18 represents -109.

Similarly, 85 is one's complement of -42, so 85 represents 42.

Wait, hold on, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, actually, in one's complement, the number N is represented as 127 - M, where M is the magnitude.

So, for example, if N is positive, M is 127 - N, so 127 - M = N. So, if N is 109, M is 18. So, M is 18, which is one's complement of 109.

But in one's complement, when you represent numbers, 0 is 00000000, which is all zeros, and -127 is 11111111.

So, in one's complement, positive numbers are not typically represented. Numbers are either zero or negative.

So, 18 and 85 are both negative numbers in one's complement.

Wait, hold on, actually, no.

Wait, 18 is one's complement of 109, so 18 is the representation of -109.

Similarly, 85 is one's complement of -42, so 85 is the representation of 42.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a positive number N, its one's complement is 127 - N.

So, 109 is a positive number, its one's complement is 127 - 109 = 18, which is the representation of -109.

Similarly, -42 is a negative number; its one's complement is 127 - (-42) = 169, which is beyond 8 bits, so we have to wrap around.

Wait, 169 in 8 bits is 169 - 256 = -87.

Wait, so -42 is represented as -87 in one's complement?

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should recall that in one's complement, to represent a negative number, you take the positive number's two's complement.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in two's complement, to represent a negative number, you invert the bits and add 1.

In one's complement, you only invert the bits, without adding 1.

So, for example, -42 in two's complement is 127 - 42 = 85, then 85 +1 = 86.

But in one's complement, -42 is just 127 - 42 = 85.

So, in one's complement, 85 represents -42.

Similarly, 109 is a positive number, so its one's complement is 127 - 109 = 18, which represents -109.

So, adding 18 and 85 in one's complement is adding -109 and -42, which is -151.

But wait, in one's complement, adding 18 and 85:

18 is 00010010

85 is 01010101

Adding them:

00010010

+01010101

=01010111, which is 91 in decimal.

But wait, 91 is more than 127? No, 91 is less than 127.

Wait, but how does this translate to numbers? Since in one's complement, the result is interpreted as a signed number.

So, 01010111 is 91, which is positive. But in one's complement, positive numbers are beyond the range of representable numbers (since one's complement is only for negative numbers and zero). Wait, actually, no. In one's complement, zero is 00000000, and the positive numbers are not typically represented, as you can only represent numbers from -127 to 0.

So, if you add two negative numbers in one's complement, you end up with a positive number, which is outside the representable range. Therefore, in one's complement, 18 + 85 (which are -109 and -42) results in 91, which is positive and outside the one's complement range.

Therefore, in one's complement, the addition is not within range.

Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify.

If we have two numbers in one's complement: 18 and 85.

18 is -109, 85 is -42.

Adding them: -109 + (-42) = -151.

But in one's complement, -151 is represented as 127 - 151 = -24, which is also incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in one's complement, you can't represent negative numbers beyond -127 to 0.

So, if you add two numbers in one's complement, you can get a sum that is positive, which is not representable in one's complement.

Therefore, in one's complement, adding -109 and -42 (represented as 18 and 85) gives 91, which is a positive number, but it's outside the one's complement range.

Therefore, in one's complement, the addition is not within range.

Hmm, so then why is the correct answer C (I and II only)?

Wait, maybe in one's complement, the range is considered differently?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of unsigned addition.

In one's complement, if you don't consider the sign, you can add numbers as if they are unsigned, but in reality, the sign is determined by the highest bit.

But if you add 18 and 85 in one's complement as unsigned, you get 103, which is 0b01110001.

But in one's complement, that is a positive number (since the highest bit is 0), but since one's complement typically only represents negative numbers and zero, positive numbers are not considered within range.

So, 103 is outside the range.

Therefore, only two's complement is within range.

Wait, but the correct answer is C, so both I and II are within range.

Hmm, maybe my analysis of one's complement is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps when adding in one's complement, you don't interpret the result as a signed number, but just consider it as an unsigned 8-bit number.

In that case, 18 + 85 = 103, which is within the 8-bit range of 0 to 127. So, as an unsigned number, 103 is within range.

But in one's complement, numbers are signed. So, the question is asking about the addition being within range, but in one
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about number representations and addition. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is asking in which of the given representations adding the integers 109 and -42 stays within range. The options are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The answer is supposed to be C, which is I and II only. Hmm, okay, let me think.

First, I need to recall how these different representations work. Let's start with each option one by one.

**I. One's complement**
One's complement is a method used to represent negative numbers in binary. The way it works is that for an 8-bit word, you take the complement of the number and add 1 to it. Essentially, it's like flipping all the bits and then adding 1. So, for example, the one's complement of a positive number will give you a negative number. But here, we're dealing with adding two numbers, 109 and -42, and seeing if the representation keeps them within range when added.

Wait, actually, no. The question is about the addition of 109 and -42 using each representation and whether the result is within range. So, in each representation, when you add 109 and -42, does the result still fit into an 8-bit word? Let me correct myself.

So, in each of these representations, if we add 109 and -42, do we get a number that can be stored in an 8-bit word? For example, in two's complement, since it's a signed representation, the numbers wrap around if they exceed the 8-bit limit. But in one's complement, same thing.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So, let me clarify: each of these representations is a way of encoding numbers in an 8-bit word. So, for each of these representations, if I add 109 and -42, will the result still be an 8-bit number? Or will it overflow?

Wait, hold on. 109 and -42 are integers. But in each representation, these numbers are stored as 8-bit words. So, when you add them, you have to make sure that the addition doesn't cause an overflow beyond the 8-bit limit, right? But actually, in these representations, overflow is handled differently.

Wait, no. When you add two 8-bit numbers, you can have an overflow. In some representations, like two's complement, overflow is handled by wrapping around, but in others, like one's complement, it's similar. But in sign and magnitude, it's just a straightforward binary number, so adding might cause an overflow beyond 8 bits.

Wait, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's not about adding two 8-bit numbers, but about adding the actual integers 109 and -42 and seeing if the result can be represented in each of these representations within an 8-bit word.

So, 109 + (-42) is 67. So, is 67 representable in each of these forms within 8 bits? Let me check each one.

**I. One's complement**
In one's complement, numbers are represented as 8-bit binary numbers. For 67, we can convert it to binary. 67 in decimal is 64 + 2 + 1, which is 1000011 in binary. Now, to represent this in 8 bits, we need to add leading zeros. So, 67 is 00100011 in 8 bits. In one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their binary equivalents, while negative numbers are one's complement plus 1. But since we're adding two positive numbers, 109 and -42, and the result is 67, which is positive, so in one's complement, 67 is just 00100011. That should fit into 8 bits without any issues. So, yes, in one's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives 67, which is within range.

Wait, but hold on. In one's complement, each number is represented as the one's complement plus 1. So, if you have a negative number, you take its magnitude's one's complement and add 1. But when adding numbers, does the one's complement addition method affect the result? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how addition works in each representation. In one's complement, adding two numbers would be similar to two's complement. For positive numbers, it should just add normally, but for negative numbers, you have to handle the carry-out properly.

But in this case, since both numbers are being added, 109 and -42, let's see: 109 is a positive number, and -42 is negative. So, in one's complement, how would 109 and -42 be represented? 109 is straightforward: it's a positive number, so it's represented as its binary equivalent in 8 bits. For -42, in one's complement, you take the one's complement of 42 and add 1.

Wait, 42 in binary is 00101010. One's complement is 11010101, then add 1 to get the negative number.

So, 109 is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109, which is 01101101 in 8 bits. -42 is 11010101 + 1 = 11010110 in 8 bits. So, adding 01101101 and 11010110:

Let me do the binary addition:

01101101
+11010110
----------

Starting from the right:
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 10, so write 0 and carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1
1 + 1 = 10, write 0 and carryover 1
0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 10, write 0 and carryover 1
0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 10, write 0 and carryover 1
But wait, we're only doing 8 bits, so that carryover would be lost. So, the result is 10010010.

Wait, let me do that again more carefully.

01101101
+11010110
=?

Starting from the rightmost bit:

Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1
Bit 6: 1 + 0 = 1
Bit 5: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
Bit 4: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1
Bit 3: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
Bit 2: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 with carryover 1
Bit 1: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 with carryover 1
Bit 0: 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 1 with carryover 1

Wait, hang on, that seems too many carries. Wait, maybe I messed up the alignment.

Wait, actually, let's write it down properly:

  01101101
+ 11010110
------------
Starting from the right:

Bit 7: 0 + 1 = 1 (no carry)
Bit 6: 1 + 0 = 1 (no carry)
Bit 5: 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1
Bit 4: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1 (no carry)
Bit 3: 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1
Bit 2: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0, carryover 1
Bit 1: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0, carryover 1
Bit 0: 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 1, carryover 1

So, the result is 10010010 and there's a carryover 1 beyond the 8 bits. So, in one's complement, this would wrap around? Or since it's a signed number, does the carryover affect the result?

Wait, in two's complement, the carryover would affect it, but in one's complement, maybe not? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in one's complement, the numbers are represented as complement plus 1, but when adding, do you handle the overflow? Hmm, maybe it's similar to two's complement in terms of overflow handling. So, in two's complement, adding two numbers can result in a carryout beyond the 8 bits, which is lost, effectively wrapping around, but in one's complement, I think it's similar.

Wait, but the result here is 10010010, which is 8 bits, so the carryover is lost, making the result effectively 10010010, which is 134 in decimal. But 109 + (-42) is 67, not 134. So, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Because in one's complement, when you represent negative numbers, you take the complement and add 1. So, 109 is positive, so it's just 01101101. -42 is represented as the one's complement of 42 plus 1, which is 11010110. So, adding those gives 10010010, which is 134 in two's complement, but in one's complement, it's just 134, which is an 8-bit number. But 109 + (-42) is 67, so why is there a discrepancy?

Oh, because in one's complement, addition is similar to two's complement, but the arithmetic is a bit different because of how negative numbers are represented. So, when you add two numbers in one's complement, you don't get the same result as their actual sum. Because the negative numbers are represented as the complement plus 1, so adding them will give a result that is not the actual sum.

Wait, so maybe the result 10010010 is not equal to 67, but in reality, in two's complement, 10010010 is -26. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in two's complement, 10010010 is 134 in decimal, which is positive because the highest bit is 1. But in one's complement, I think it's treated differently. Wait, maybe one's complement doesn't have a sign bit per se, but in reality, one's complement is used in some systems where all numbers, positive and negative, are represented as the complement plus 1, but it's usually in combination with two's complement.

I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to step back.

So, the question is not about adding the numbers in their respective representations, but adding the integers 109 and -42 and seeing if their sum can be represented in each of the given representations within an 8-bit word.

So, 109 + (-42) = 67. So, is 67 representable in:

I. One's complement: 67 is a positive number. In one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their binary equivalents. So, 67 in binary is 64 + 2 + 1 = 1000011, which is 8 bits as 00100011. So, yes, it can be represented.

II. Two's complement: Similarly, 67 is a positive number, so it's represented as 00100011 in 8 bits.

III. Sign and magnitude: In sign and magnitude, numbers are represented with the sign bit and the magnitude. So, positive numbers start with 0, negative with 1. So, 67 is positive, so it would be 0 followed by the magnitude 00100011. So, yes, that fits in 8 bits.

So, all three representations can represent 67 in 8 bits. Hmm, that contradicts the given answer.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe it's not about whether the sum can be represented, but whether the addition operation itself can be performed without causing an overflow.

Wait, that is, when you add 109 and -42 in each representation, does the result overflow beyond the 8-bit word? Or stay within?

But 67 is within the range of 8-bit numbers, which is from -128 to 127. So, 67 is within that range. So, in that case, all three representations can represent 67.

But the answer is supposed to be C, which is I and II only. So, that must mean that in one's complement, perhaps the addition of 109 and -42 does not result in 67, but in some other number, or it overflows.

Wait, maybe I should convert 109 and -42 into their respective representations in one's complement and two's complement, then add them, and see if the result is 67.

Let me try that.

First, let's get 8-bit representations for 109, -42 in each system.

**One's complement:**

In one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their binary equivalents. So, 109 in binary is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109, which is 01101101.

Negative numbers are represented as the one's complement of their magnitude plus 1. So, -42 is the one's complement of 42 plus 1.

42 in binary is 00101010. One's complement of that is 11010101. Adding 1 gives 11010110. So, in one's complement, -42 is 11010110.

Now, let's add 01101101 (109) and 11010110 (-42).

Adding them:

  01101101
+ 11010110
------------
Let's do binary addition:

Start from the right:

1 (LSB) + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1
1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 with carryover 1

Wait, so the result is 10010010, which is 134 in decimal. But 109 + (-42) is 67, not 134. So, adding them in one's complement gives a different result.

Wait, so in one's complement, adding 109 and -42 does not give 67, but 134. Therefore, the sum is different because the representation of negative numbers is different. So, in two's complement, the same sum would give 67, but in one's complement, it doesn't.

So, maybe in the question, it's about whether the sum can be represented in that system, i.e., whether the addition in that system results in a number within the range.

But in one's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives 134, which is beyond the 8-bit one's complement range. Wait, but 134 in one's complement would be represented as 10010010, which is still within 8 bits.

But wait, in one's complement, the maximum positive number is 127 (all ones). Wait, no. In one's complement, the range is from -128 to 127, similar to two's complement.

Wait, hold on. Actually, in one's complement, 8-bit numbers can represent numbers from -128 to 127, same as two's complement.

But when we add 109 and -42 in one's complement, we get 134, which is beyond 127. So, that would cause an overflow, right? Because 134 is outside the range of -128 to 127.

Wait, but 134 is 10010010 in 8 bits, which is 134 in decimal. But 134 is outside the maximum 127, so in one's complement, adding 109 and -42 would cause an overflow, hence the result is not 67, but it wraps around or is considered as 134.

But in two's complement, the addition of 109 and -42 is 67, which is within the range. So, in two's complement, addition is correct and stays within the 8-bit range.

In one's complement, addition leads to an overflow because the result is beyond the maximum positive number.

So, if the question is about whether the addition stays within the 8-bit range, in two's complement it's okay, but in one's complement, it causes an overflow, so the result is not the correct 67, but wraps to 134.

Therefore, only two's complement allows the addition to stay within the 8-bit range without overflow, so the sum is correct.

Wait, but in one's complement, if you add 109 and -42, you get 134, which is beyond the 127 maximum, hence it's outside the range. So, in one's complement, the sum is out of range, but in two's complement, it's 67, which is in range.

Similarly, in sign and magnitude, the sum is 67, which is within 8 bits.

Wait, no, actually, in sign and magnitude, how is 67 represented? It's a positive number, so it's 0 followed by the magnitude in binary. So, 67 is 00100011, which is 8 bits. So, it's within the range.

So, in one's complement, the sum is 134, which is beyond the one's complement range of -128 to 127. So, 134 is outside.

In two's complement, the sum is 67, which is within the two's complement range.

In sign and magnitude, the sum is 67, which is within the 8-bit range.

Wait, so does that mean that in one's complement, the addition of 109 and -42 does not stay within the 8-bit range, because it causes an overflow, whereas in the other two, it does?

But the question is: "In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?"

So, in two's complement, the addition is within range (67). In one's complement, the addition is outside the range (134). In sign and magnitude, the addition is within range (67).

Thus, both II (two's complement) and III (sign and magnitude) allow the addition to be within range. But in one's complement, it's not. Therefore, the answer is II and III, but the given answer is
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is C, which is I and II only. The question is about adding 109 and -42 using different number representations in 8-bit words, and we need to determine in which of these representations the addition stays within range.

First, let me recall what I know about number representations. There are three main ways to represent numbers in binary: Sign and magnitude, One's complement, and Two's complement.

Starting with Sign and magnitude. In this system, positive numbers are represented as usual, and negative numbers have their sign bit set to negative (usually a 1), and the magnitude is stored as the absolute value. So, for example, -42 would be represented by a 8-bit word with the sign bit as 1 and the next 7 bits representing 42 in binary. But adding numbers in Sign and magnitude can be tricky because you have to handle the sign bit carefully. You can't just add the two numbers directly; you need to use some method to add their magnitudes and then set the sign bit accordingly.

One's complement is another method where to represent negative numbers, you take the two's complement of the magnitude. So, to get the one's complement, you invert the bits of the positive number. For example, if you want -42, you first convert 42 to its 8-bit binary form, invert all the bits, and that gives you the one's complement. However, I think one's complement is not as commonly used anymore because it's less efficient in terms of handling negative numbers and addition.

Two's complement is the method we use almost exclusively in computers because it allows for easy addition of positive and negative numbers. In two's complement, to represent a negative number, you first take the one's complement of the magnitude and then add 1 to it. So, for -42, you would take the one's complement of 42 and then add 1. This also means that adding two numbers in two's complement can be done without any special handling because the hardware automatically handles the carry-out and the sign bit.

The problem is asking whether adding 109 and -42 is within range in each of these representations. So, I need to figure out what "within range" means. I think it refers to whether the sum and difference can be represented within the 8-bit word, meaning the result shouldn't overflow beyond the 8-bit boundary. So, we need to ensure that the result doesn't exceed the maximum value (127) or go below the minimum value (-128) for 8-bit two's complement.

Let me compute the sum of 109 and -42 first. 109 minus 42 is 67. So, 67 is a positive number. Now, I need to see if this result can be represented in each of the three number representations without causing an overflow.

Starting with Sign and magnitude: Since 67 is positive, the sign bit should be 0. So, we can represent 67 in 8-bit Sign and magnitude by setting the sign bit to 0 and the remaining 7 bits to the binary representation of 67. Let me check the binary of 67. 64 is 64, so 64 + 3 is 67, so in binary, that's 1000011. But wait, 8 bits. So, it would be 00100011. So, with a sign bit of 0, the 8-bit word is 00100011. That's fine. So, in Sign and magnitude, the addition is fine.

Now, One's complement: Let me think. Since One's complement is a method where negative numbers are represented by inverting the bits of the positive number, but it's a bit more involved when adding. To add two numbers in One's complement, you would have to add their magnitudes and then determine the sign bit based on the result.

So, adding 109 and -42 in One's complement. Since 109 is positive, its One's complement would be its inverse, and -42 is also represented by inverting 42's bits. But when adding, you have to handle the carry-over beyond 8 bits. Hmm, maybe it's better to convert both numbers to their one's complement representations.

But actually, maybe I should think about what the sum is and check if the result can be represented within 8 bits. The sum is 67, which is positive. So, in one's complement, the sign bit would be 0. Let me try converting 67 to its One's complement. Wait, actually, in One's complement, negative numbers are represented by the inverse, but positive numbers are the same as their binary. So, 67 is positive, so in One's complement, it's the same as binary 00100011. So, that's already 8 bits. So, since 67 is within 0 to 127, it can be represented in One's complement. So, the addition is within range here as well?

Wait, but I remember that in One's complement, when you add numbers, you have to be careful with overflow. Because if the sum exceeds 8 bits, you have to discard the overflow. So, in this case, 109 plus (-42) is 67, which is 8 bits. So, the result doesn't cause an overflow in terms of the bits. So, perhaps it is within range. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the addition is possible without any issues, i.e., whether the result is within the representable range. For Two's complement, the range is -128 to 127. For Sign and magnitude, the range is also -128 to 127, but handling negative numbers is different. For One's complement, the range is also -128 to 127, but it's less efficient.

Wait, maybe the confusion is whether the addition is within the range of 8-bit numbers for each method. So, for each method, whether 109 + (-42) = 67 is representable in that method.

In Sign and magnitude, 67 is representable because it's positive, so sign bit is 0 and the rest is 67. So, yes.

In One's complement, 67 is positive, so in the One's complement system, I think positive numbers are represented the same way as in binary. Wait, no. In One's complement, positive numbers are represented with the sign bit as 0, and negative with 1. So, 67 is positive, so it's represented as 00100011, which is 8 bits. So, yes, that's within the One's complement range as well.

Wait, that seems contradictory to my initial thought that the answer is C. Maybe the problem is not whether the result is within 8 bits but whether the addition can be performed in that representation. Because in Sign and magnitude, adding two numbers is more involved. So, if you have 109 and -42, in Sign and magnitude, you can add them by converting to magnitude, adding, then applying the sign. But is that practical?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in Sign and magnitude, to add two numbers, you have to convert both numbers to their magnitude, add them, and then set the sign bit. So, for 109 and -42, 109 is positive, so its magnitude is 109, and -42 is negative, so its magnitude is 42. So, adding 109 and 42 gives 151. Now, in 8-bit Sign and magnitude, can we represent 151? Hmm, 151 is greater than 127, which is the maximum positive number in 8-bit two's complement. So, 151 is outside the 8-bit range. Therefore, in Sign and magnitude, the addition would result in a number beyond the 8-bit range, so it's not representable. So, that would mean that in Sign and magnitude, the addition is not within range. Therefore, the addition of 109 and -42 is not within range in Sign and magnitude. Wait, but earlier, I thought 67 is representable. Maybe I'm conflating two different things.

Wait, no. I think the confusion is whether the sum 67 is within the range, but actually, in the process of adding 109 and -42, you may have an intermediate result that overflows.

Wait, let's clarify.

In the process of adding 109 and -42, if we're using Sign and magnitude, you need to:

1. Convert both numbers to their magnitude.
2. Add them.
3. Then, set the sign bit according to the original numbers.

So, 109 is positive, and -42 is negative, so the result's sign is negative. Then, you add 109 + 42 = 151.

But 151 is greater than 127, which is the maximum positive 8-bit number in two's complement. So, 151 cannot be represented in 8 bits. Therefore, in Sign and magnitude, you cannot represent 151, which is the sum of the magnitudes.

Therefore, in Sign and magnitude, the addition of 109 and -42 would result in a number that is not representable within 8 bits. Hence, it's not within range.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the result of the addition is 67, which is 00100011, which is 8 bits. But that may be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in thinking about the process.

Wait, in Sign and magnitude, if you have two numbers, say, A and B, their addition is performed by:

- If A and B have the same sign, add their magnitudes.
- If they have different signs, add the magnitude of the smaller number to the magnitude of the larger number, and set the sign bit accordingly.

But actually, is that the case? Or is it that you have to add the absolute values regardless of the sign? Then, set the sign based on the original numbers.

Wait, let me check a resource.

In Sign and magnitude, yes, the addition process is:

1. If the numbers have different signs, add their magnitudes and set the sign bit to the sign of the original numbers.
2. If the numbers have the same sign, add their magnitudes and set the sign bit accordingly.

So, in this case, adding 109 (positive) and -42 (negative). So, we add their magnitudes, 109 + 42 = 151, set the sign bit to negative (since -42 is negative). Now, 151 is beyond 127, which is the maximum positive number in 8-bit two's complement.

Therefore, 151 cannot be represented in 8 bits, so the addition would result in an overflow. So, in Sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42 is not within range because the intermediate sum 151 can't be represented.

Therefore, in Sign and magnitude, the addition is not within range. So, the correct answer cannot be III (Sign and magnitude). So, the correct answer is probably only I and II, which is One's complement and Two's complement.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. If in the One's complement system, can the addition of 109 and -42 result in a number within the 8-bit range? The sum is 67, which is 00100011 in 8 bits. So, in One's complement, 67 is represented as 00100011, as it's positive. So, adding 109 and -42 in One's complement is straightforward? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, in One's complement, to add two numbers, you have to add their One's complement representations. So, first, you convert both numbers to their One's complement forms.

Wait, 109 in binary is 01101101. So, its One's complement is 10010010. Similarly, -42 is represented in One's complement by taking the One's complement of 42 and then adding 1? Wait, no. Wait, in One's complement, negative numbers are represented by inverting the bits of the positive number. So, to get -42, you take the binary of 42, invert all the bits, which is 11111110 + 42 in binary is 00100010, so the one's complement is 11011101.

Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in One's complement, the negative number is the inverse of the positive magnitude, regardless of the sign. So, 42 in binary is 00101010 (assuming 8 bits). Inverting it gives 11010101, which is -42 in One's complement.

So, 109 is positive, so its One's complement is the inversion of its binary: 109 is 01101101, invert to get 10010010. So, in One's complement, 109 is 10010010, and -42 is 11010101.

Now, adding these two One's complement numbers:

10010010
+ 11010101
= ?

Let me add them:

Starting from the right:

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 1 = 10 (carryover 1)
0 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 10.

Wait, so the result is 01001110 with a carryover of 1. But since it's One's complement, you need to handle the overflow. If there's a carryover, you discard it. So, the result is 01001110, which is 54 in decimal.

Wait, but 54 is positive. But the sum of 109 and -42 is 67, not 54. That's a problem. So, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, no. Wait, in One's complement, to add two numbers, you have to add their One's complement representations and then discard any overflow. So, the result is 01001110, which is 54, but that can't be right because 109 - 42 is 67, not 54.

Wait, so there's an issue here. Perhaps in One's complement, the addition is not straightforward because the sign bits interact differently.

Wait, maybe I should interpret the result in terms of two's complement. So, if I have 01001110 in One's complement, to get its two's complement, I can invert it and add 1. Let's see:

Inverting 01001110 gives 10110001. Adding 1 gives 10110010, which is -54 in two's complement.

Wait, so in One's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives us 54, but in two's complement terms, it's -54. That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 109 in One's complement is 10010010, and -42 is 11010101. Adding them gives 01001110, which is 54 in decimal. But that's not 67.

Alternatively, maybe the error is that 54 is actually the sum in One's complement, but since we have a carryover, we discard it, so the actual result is 54. But that doesn't align with the mathematical sum.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the binary addition.

Wait, let's write it down:

10010010
+11010101
= ?

Let's add each bit:

Right to left:

Bit 0: 0 + 1 = 1
Bit 1: 1 + 0 = 1
Bit 2: 0 + 1 = 1
Bit 3: 1 + 0 = 1
Bit 4: 0 + 1 = 1
Bit 5: 0 + 0 = 0
Bit 6: 1 + 1 = 0 (carryover 1)
Bit 7: 0 + 1 + carryover 1 = 0 (carryover 1)

But with an overflow, so the carryover is discarded.

So, the sum is 01001110, which is 54, but that's not the correct result. So, perhaps in One's complement, adding two numbers doesn't give the same result as in two's complement.

Therefore, in One's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives 54 instead of 67, which is not the correct result. So, perhaps in One's complement, adding two numbers is not as straightforward as in two's complement, which is why we mostly use two's complement.

Therefore, perhaps the issue is that in One's complement, the sum doesn't correspond to the actual integer result, so it's not reliable for arithmetic operations. Therefore, the addition of 109 and -42 cannot be done within the 8-bit One's complement system without causing an incorrect result or an overflow.

Wait, but 54 is a 5-bit number, so in 8 bits, it's 01001110, which is still within 8 bits, right? So, if the sum is 54, then it is within the 8-bit range, but it's not the correct result.

So, in terms of the question, it's asking whether the addition is "within range." So, in One's complement, is 54 within the 8-bit range? Yes, 54 is between -128 and 127. So, maybe in that sense, the addition is within range, but the result is incorrect. Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking whether the addition can be performed without causing an overflow, regardless of the correctness of the result. So, in One's complement, when adding 10010010 and 11010101, the sum is 01001110 with a carryover of 1, which is discarded. So, since it's within 8 bits, it's within range.

But then again, in two's complement, the result is 67, which is also within 8 bits. So, why is the answer C, meaning I and II, only?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the range within which the numbers can be added without overflow. In Sign and magnitude, the addition can lead to a sum beyond 127, which cannot be represented, as we saw earlier with 151.

In One's complement, the addition is 54, which is within 127, so no problem. In two's complement, the sum is 67, which is also within 127.

Wait, but in the question, it's about "the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range." So, perhaps it's not about whether the sum is within the 8-bit range, but whether the addition can be performed using that representation without overflow.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's think about each representation:

I. One's complement: To add 109 and -42 in One's complement.
-
[overthinking]
Okay, I have this question here about adding the integers 109 and -42 using different representations, and I need to figure out in which of the given representations the addition stays within the range. The options are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The answer is said to be C. I and II only, but I want to understand why that is.

First, let me recall what each of these representations means.

Starting with One's complement: I remember that in one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their two's complement, and negative numbers are the complement of their absolute value. So, to get the one's complement of a number, you subtract it from 255 (since we're dealing with 8-bit words). For example, the one's complement of 5 would be 255 - 5 = 250. This is a method used in some early computers, but not as commonly used today.

Two's complement: This is another method for representing signed integers. To convert a number to two's complement, you take the one's complement and then add 1. For example, the two's complement of 5 is 250 + 1 = 251. Two's complement is widely used because it allows for easy addition of negative numbers without having to deal with complementation for each operation.

Sign and magnitude: This is a more straightforward representation where each number is stored with its sign (either 0 or 1) and its magnitude (the absolute value). This is similar to how we represent numbers in everyday arithmetic, but in fixed-width storage systems like 8-bit words, you can't just store the magnitude; you have to use two's complement or one's complement to represent negative numbers.

Now, the question is about adding 109 and -42 in each of these representations and whether the result is within the range of the 8-bit word.

First, let's figure out what the actual sum is. In decimal, 109 + (-42) is 67. So, the correct result should be 67. Now, in an 8-bit two's complement system, the range is from -128 to 127. Wait, 67 is within that range, so two's complement can handle that. But in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127. Since 67 is also within that range, both one's and two's complement can represent 67, so the addition would result in 67 in both cases. However, sign and magnitude, as I understand, would just have the sign bit and the magnitude, so 67 is straightforward.

But wait, the question is about the addition of 109 and -42 in each of these representations. So, does it mean that both numbers are stored in the 8-bit word, and then we add them as 8-bit words, or are they 8-bit numbers? Wait, 109 is a 3-byte number, but in 8-bit representation, we can store it as a positive number. Similarly, -42 can be stored in two's complement or one's complement.

Wait, no, the question says "the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range." So, it's about the addition operation resulting in a value that is within the range of representable numbers for each of the representations.

So, in each of the representations, if you add 109 and -42, do you get a number that can be represented in that system without overflow? Or is it about the intermediate steps?

Wait, maybe that's not the correct interpretation. Let me reread the question.

"In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?"

Hmm, maybe the question is asking, when you add 109 and -42 in each of these representations, does the result fit within the range of an 8-bit word in that representation. So, for each representation, compute 109 + (-42), and see if the result is within the range of representable numbers in that system.

So, let me consider each representation.

First, let's convert 109 and -42 into each representation.

Starting with two's complement because I think it's more straightforward for negative numbers.

In two's complement, 109 is just 109, since it's already positive. -42 in two's complement is -42. So, adding 109 and -42 gives 67. Now, in two's complement, an 8-bit number can represent from -128 to 127. 67 is within this range, so two's complement can represent the sum without any issues.

Next, one's complement. In one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their two's complement. So, 109 in one's complement is 255 - 109 = 146. Similarly, -42 in one's complement is the complement of 42, which is 255 - 42 = 213. So, adding 146 and 213.

Wait, hold on. In one's complement, to get the negative number, you take the complement. So, in one's complement, 109 is 146, and -42 is 213. So adding 146 + 213 in one's complement. Let's compute that.

146 + 213 = 359. Now, 359 is greater than 255, so we have to do one's complement addition with the carryover.

Wait, but in one's complement, addition is similar to binary addition with two's complement. Wait, no, in one's complement, you add the two numbers and any carryover beyond 255 wraps around.

Wait, actually, in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127, so 146 is 109's one's complement, which is positive, and 213 is the one's complement of -42, which is also positive. So, adding 146 + 213 in one's complement without considering the carryover would give 359, which is more than 255, so you have to do it with carryover.

But wait, in one's complement, addition requires handling the carry-over beyond 255 as negative.

Wait, let me recall: in one's complement arithmetic, adding two numbers, if the sum exceeds 255, you subtract 256 (which is 2^8) and it becomes negative, but you have to continue adding until the carry becomes zero or until you have an overflow.

Wait, no, actually, when you add two one's complement numbers, you can have a result that is either within the range or requires carryover which is handled similarly to two's complement.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to consider that in one's complement, addition is similar to two's complement. Since one's complement is used in some systems, but mostly not anymore.

Wait, perhaps converting these to two's complement and adding might be easier.

So, 109 in two's complement is 109, which is straightforward.

-42 in two's complement is 255 - 42 = 213.

Wait, that's the same as in one's complement. Hmm, so in two's complement, -42 is 213, which is why in one's complement, the negative 42 is also represented as 213, but in one's complement, the range is different.

Wait, maybe I need to double-check.

Hold on, in two's complement, the number -42 is computed as 256 - 42 = 214? Wait, 256 - 42 is 214. Wait, no, 256 is 2^8, which is 256.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute -42 in two's complement.

To get two's complement, you take the one's complement and add 1.

So, the one's complement of 42 is 255 - 42 = 213.

Adding 1 gives 214, so -42 in two's complement is 214.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said -42 in two's complement is 213. Actually, it's 214.

So, that changes things.

So, in two's complement, 109 + (-42) is 109 + 214.

109 + 214 = 323.

Now, 323 is greater than 255, so we need to compute it modulo 256.

323 - 256 = 67.

So, in two's complement, the sum is 67, which is within the range of -128 to 127.

Therefore, two's complement can represent the sum within its range.

Now, for one's complement.

In one's complement, 109 is represented as 255 - 109 = 146.

Similarly, -42 in one's complement is 255 - 42 = 213.

So, adding 146 + 213 = 359.

But 359 is beyond 255, so we need to handle the overflow.

In one's complement, the addition can cause an overflow beyond 255, which is treated as negative numbers.

Wait, but actually, in one's complement, the system only represents numbers from -127 to 127, so 359 is outside that range.

So, let me see how to handle the addition.

Adding 146 and 213:

146 + 213 = 359.

Since 359 is greater than 255, we subtract 256 (which is 2^8) and continue adding until the result is within 0-255.

359 - 256 = 103.

So, 103 is the result.

Wait, but 103 is a positive number. But is that correct?

Wait, actually, in one's complement, the addition is not as straightforward because of the carryover.

Wait, let me think again. In one's complement, the maximum positive number is 127, which is 2^7 -1.

So, if you add two numbers, and the sum is beyond 255, you subtract 256 until it is within 0-255. Each subtraction represents a borrow in the next higher bit. But since we only have 8 bits, we can't go beyond that.

Wait, 359 is the sum, so 359 - 256 = 103, which is within 0-255, so 103 is the result.

But 103 is positive, but in one's complement, it can represent positive and negative numbers.

Wait, hold on, but 103 is a positive number, but how is that related to the original numbers?

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, if I add two positive numbers, 109 and -42, in one's complement, how does that translate?

Wait, 109 in one's complement is 146.

-42 in one's complement is 213.

So, 146 + 213 = 359.

But in one's complement, 359 is beyond the maximum value 255, so you need to perform the addition with carryover.

Wait, so when adding 146 + 213:

146 + 213 = 359.

But 359 in binary is 101100011.

Since we're in 8 bits, we can only have 8 bits, so we subtract 256 (which is 100000000 in binary) to get 359 - 256 = 103, which is 00001101011, but in 8 bits, it's 00001101, which is 103.

Wait, but 103 is still a positive number. However, since we have a carryover beyond the 8 bits, in one's complement, that's considered an overflow, and the result is 103.

But 103 is less than 255, but 103 is within the range of one's complement, which goes from -127 to 127. Wait, 103 is positive, so it's within the range.

Therefore, in one's complement, the result is 103, which is within the range. Hmm, that seems different from my initial thought.

Wait, but that conflicts with my understanding that in two's complement, the result is 67, which is also within the range.

But if both one's and two's complement can represent 67, why is the correct answer C: I and II only?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial computation.

Wait, no, in two's complement, adding 109 (109) and -42 (214): 109 + 214 = 323. 323 mod 256 is 67, which is correct. So, two's complement can represent 67.

In one's complement, 109 is 146, -42 is 213. 146 + 213 = 359. 359 mod 256 is 103. 103 is within the range of one's complement, which is -127 to 127.

Wait, 103 is positive, so that's within the upper limit.

Wait, but in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127, right? Because in 8 bits, the maximum negative number is -127, and the maximum positive number is 127. So, 103 is within that.

So, in both two's complement and one's complement, the sum is within the 8-bit range. Then why is the answer C: I and II only?

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the numbers 109 and -42 can be represented without issue in each system.

Wait, 109 is a positive number, so it's straightforward in both one's and two's complement.

-42: in two's complement, as we saw, is 214.

In one's complement, -42 is the complement of 42, which is 213.

But in both cases, they are within the representable range.

Wait, but maybe the question is about whether the addition of 109 and -42 in each representation results in a number that can be represented in that system without sign issues or overflows.

Wait, let me think. In one's complement, if you're adding 109 and -42, which are both positive and negative numbers, respectively, but in one's complement, the negative is represented as 213.

Adding 146 and 213, which is 359. But 359 is outside 8 bits, but in one's complement, we can represent it as 359 - 256 = 103, which is positive.

Wait, so 103 is positive, so it's within the one's complement range.

In two's complement, the same addition gives 67, which is within the range.

Wait, so both representations can handle the addition without overflow or underflow?

Wait, but in two's complement, the range is from -128 to 127, which is a total of 256 numbers.

In one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127, which is 255 numbers.

Wait, so if the result is 67, in two's complement, it's within the range.

In one's complement, 67 is also within the range because one's complement goes up to 127.

Wait, but if the result had been, say, 128, in two's complement, 128 is beyond the maximum positive value and is considered as -128.

But in one's complement, 128 is beyond the maximum as well, but in one's complement, it's just 128, which is not representable. Wait, but in one's complement, the maximum positive is 127, so 128 is beyond.

Wait, but in one's complement, when you add two numbers, the result may go beyond 255, but you handle it by subtracting 256, so 359 - 256 = 103, which is within the 8-bit one's complement range.

Wait, this is confusing.

Let me try a different approach.

In each representation, when adding 109 and -42, is the result within the range of numbers that can be represented in that system? So, for each system:

1. Two's complement: The system can represent from -128 to 127. The sum is 67, which is within this range.

2. One's complement: The system can represent from -127 to 127. The sum is 103, which is also within this range.

3. Sign and magnitude: In this case, 109 is stored as (1, 109), and -42 is stored as (1, 42). The sign bit is 1, and the magnitude is 42. When adding, you add the magnitude and the sign. Since one is positive and the other is negative, the result is negative. The magnitude of the sum is 109 + 42 = 151. So, in sign and magnitude, you would store (-1, 151). 151 is within the 8-bit range, as 151 is less than 255. So, the sum is 151, which is within the 8-bit range.

Wait a minute, so in all three representations, the sum is within the 8-bit range.

But the correct answer is supposed to be C: I and II only. So, why is sign and magnitude excluded?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question is: "In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?"

So, does it mean that when performing the addition, the intermediate steps are within the 8-bit range, or the final sum?

Wait, if I consider the addition process in each representation.

In two's complement, adding 109 and -42 is straightforward because the two's complement of -42 is 214. 109 + 214 = 323, which is 67 in two's complement (since 323 - 256 = 67). 67 is within the two's complement range.

In one's complement, adding 109 (146) and -42 (213).

146 + 213 = 359.

But in one's complement, the sum can't exceed 255. So, you subtract 256, getting 103.

But 103 is within the one's complement range.

In sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42.

109 is represented as (1, 109), and -42 as (1, 42). Adding the magnitudes: 109 + 42 = 151. So, the sum is (-1, 151), which is 151 in magnitude, and it's within the 8-bit range because 151 is less than 255.

So, in all three representations, the addition stays within the 8-bit range.

Wait, but the answer is supposed to be C: I and II only.

So, perhaps the question is about whether the numbers 109 and -42 can be added in that representation without causing an overflow during the addition process.

Wait, perhaps in one's complement, adding 109 and -42 causes an overflow, whereas in two's complement, it doesn't.

Wait, how does that work?

In two's complement, adding 109 and -42 (which is 214) gives 323, which is 67 in two's complement without any issues.

In one's complement, 109 is 146, and -42 is 213. Adding 146 + 213 gives 359, which is
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question here about different number representations and which one can handle the addition of 109 and -42 without going out of range. The options are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The correct answer is supposed to be C, which is I and II only. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me recall what each of these representations means. I remember that in computing, especially with binary numbers, we use different methods to represent both positive and negative numbers. The main ones I know are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. Let me go through each of them.

Starting with One's complement. From what I remember, One's complement is a method where negative numbers are represented by the complement of the number's bits. So, for an 8-bit number, you take the binary, invert each bit (1s become 0s and 0s become 1s), and that's the one's complement. This system doesn't really have a sign bit, so it's a bit tricky because both positive and negative numbers are just different combinations of 1s and 0s.

Then there's Two's complement, which I think is an improvement over One's complement. In Two's complement, you first take the one's complement of the number and then add 1 to it. This results in a signed number system where the most significant bit acts as the sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive, and if it's 1, the number is negative. This seems more efficient because it can handle both positive and negative numbers in a straightforward way without requiring a separate sign bit.

Lastly, there's Sign and magnitude. I think this is more like a generalization where the number has a sign bit (either +1 or -1) followed by the magnitude bits. So, for an 8-bit number, it would have 1 bit for the sign and 7 bits for the magnitude. This makes it similar to how we might represent numbers in a floating-point system but on a fixed bit size.

The question is about adding 109 and -42 and whether this addition is within the range for each representation. Since all these are 8-bit representations, I need to see what the maximum and minimum values are for each system.

Starting with One's complement. Since it's an 8-bit system, the maximum positive number is 127 (which is 2^7 - 1) and the minimum negative number is -128 (which is -2^7). So, the range is -128 to 127. Now, both 109 and -42 fall within this range because 109 is less than 127, and -42 is greater than -128. So, adding them would give 67, which is also within the range. So, One's complement can handle this addition without issues.

Moving on to Two's complement. Here, the range is slightly different. The maximum positive number is still 127, and the minimum is -128. Wait, isn't that the same as One's complement? Hmm, actually, no. Wait, in Two's complement, can you represent all numbers from -128 to 127? Yes, because that's the standard 8-bit Two's complement range. So, both 109 and -42 are within this range, and their sum is 67, which is also within the range. So, Two's complement can also handle this addition.

Now, Sign and magnitude. Here, the representation is a bit different. It has a sign bit followed by magnitude bits. For an 8-bit number, the sign bit is 1 bit, and the magnitude is 7 bits. So, the maximum positive number is 01111111, which is 127, and the minimum negative number is 10000000, which is -128. Wait, that's the same as Two's complement. Hmm, but hold on, in Sign and magnitude, is the maximum positive number 127 and minimum -128? Or is it different?

Let me think. In Sign and magnitude, the sign bit is separate. So, for an 8-bit number, the magnitude can go up to 2^7 - 1 = 127, and the sign can be +1 or -1. So, the maximum positive number is 127, and the minimum negative number is -128. So, actually, in terms of range, Sign and magnitude can represent numbers from -128 to 127, same as Two's complement. So, 109 and -42 are both within this range, and their sum is 67, which is also within the range. So, why is the correct answer not including III?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm missing something. The question is about the addition being within range, but perhaps Sign and magnitude doesn't handle the addition as smoothly? Wait, but in terms of the individual numbers, they are within the range. But does adding them cause an overflow or wrap around?

Wait, no, because 109 + (-42) = 67, which is within the range of -128 to 127. So, in all three representations, the sum is within the range. But the correct answer is C, which is I and II only, so maybe III isn't acceptable.

Hmm, maybe my understanding is off. Let me double-check. In Sign and magnitude, the numbers are represented with a sign bit and magnitude. So, the magnitude is 7 bits, which can go up to 127. So, 109 is 7 bits, which is fine. -42 is also representable because the magnitude is 42, which is within 7 bits. Adding them, we get 67, which is still within 7 bits, so 67 is 01000011 in binary, which is 8 bits but still within the magnitude.

Wait, but in Sign and magnitude, the 8-bit word has 1 sign bit and 7 magnitude bits. So, 67 is positive, so sign bit is 0, and magnitude is 67, which is 01000011. But wait, that's 8 bits, but the magnitude is only 7 bits. So, actually, when adding in Sign and magnitude, do they overflow or not?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. In Sign and magnitude, each number is 8 bits, with the first bit as sign and the next 7 as magnitude. So, when adding two numbers, you have to add their magnitude parts and handle the sign accordingly. So, does the addition of 109 and -42 cause any issues?

Well, 109 is 64 + 32 + 13, which is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1, so in binary, 01101101.

-42 is a negative number. In Sign and magnitude, to represent -42, the sign bit is 1 and the magnitude is 42. So, 42 in 7 bits is 00101010.

So, when adding 01101101 (109) and 10001010 (which is sign 1 and magnitude 42), let's perform the addition:

  01101101
+ 10001010
-----------

Adding the magnitude parts: 01101101 + 00101010 = 01001011, which is 67. Now, since the second number has a sign bit, which is 1, the result should be negative. So, in Sign and magnitude, the result would be sign 1 and magnitude 01001011, which is -67. But in the question, we are adding 109 and -42, which is 67, not -67.

Wait, hold on. So, in Sign and magnitude, when you add a positive and a negative number, the result's sign is determined by the sign of the numbers being added. Since 109 is positive and -42 is negative, the result should be negative. So, 67 should be represented as -67, which is 10001011 in 8-bit Sign and magnitude.

But 10001011 is 8 bits, with sign bit 1 and magnitude 67. But wait, 67 in 7 bits is 01001011, so in the 8-bit word, it's 10001011. So, that is within the 8-bit range.

Wait, but the question is about the addition of 109 and -42 being within range. So, in Sign and magnitude, it's possible because the result is -67, which is within the range of -128 to 127. So, why is the correct answer C, meaning I and II only, and not including III?

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

"In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?"

Wait, does it mean that when you add 109 and -42, is the result within the range? Or is the addition operation itself possible without causing an overflow?

Wait, if I add 109 and -42, the sum is 67, which is within the range for all three representations. So, why is the correct answer not including III?

Wait, perhaps in Sign and magnitude, adding two numbers might require more than 8 bits. Let me see, 109 is 01101101, which is 8 bits, -42 is 10001010, which is also 8 bits. When you add them, you get 01001011, which is 67, but if you have to represent this in Sign and magnitude, it would be 10001011, which is also 8 bits. So, the addition doesn't cause any overflow beyond 8 bits.

Wait, but if the addition resulted in a number that required more than 8 bits, then it would be out of range. For example, if you had a larger number, but in this case, 67 is within 8 bits.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the representation. Maybe in Two's complement, the range is -128 to 127, but in Sign and magnitude, the range is actually different?

Wait, no, in Sign and magnitude, for an 8-bit number, the magnitude can go up to 127, so the minimum is -128. So, the range is the same.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. If all three representations can handle adding 109 and -42 without going out of range, then why is the correct answer only I and II?

Is there a misunderstanding in how the addition is performed? Maybe in Sign and magnitude, adding two numbers might require more than 8 bits because you have to handle the sign separately.

Wait, let me think about the process of addition in Sign and magnitude. If you add two numbers, one positive and one negative, you first add their magnitudes and then set the sign accordingly.

So, 109 is positive, represented as 0 01101101.

-42 is negative, represented as 1 00101010.

Adding the magnitudes:

01101101 (109)
+ 00101010 (42)
= 01001011 (67)

Now, since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result's sign is negative, so we set the sign bit to 1 and keep the magnitude as 67, giving us 1 01001011, which is 10001011 in binary.

Wait, but 10001011 is 8 bits, so that's fine. So, the result is within the 8-bit range.

Therefore, in all three representations, the addition is possible without going out of range.

But the correct answer is C, which is I and II only. So, that suggests that III is not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is not about the result of the addition, but about the process of adding. Maybe in Sign and magnitude, adding two numbers would require more than 8 bits? Let me check.

Wait, 109 is 7 bits in magnitude, and -42 is 6 bits in magnitude. When adding, we have to represent the sum in magnitude as 67, which is 6 bits. So, in the 8-bit word, the magnitude part is 67, which is within 7 bits. So, adding in Sign and magnitude doesn't cause an overflow beyond 8 bits.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the representations can represent both 109 and -42. So, in Sign and magnitude, yes, because 109 is 0 01101101 and -42 is 1 00101010, both of which are 8-bit numbers. So, the addition is possible.

Wait, but why is the correct answer not including III? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in considering whether in Sign and magnitude, the addition may result in a number that overflows the magnitude bits. Let me see.

So, adding 109 and -42 gives 67. 67 is less than 128, so it's within 7 bits. Therefore, in the Sign and magnitude representation, it can be represented as 10001011, which is 8 bits, with sign bit 1 and magnitude 67. So, that's fine.

Wait, maybe the confusion is that in Sign and magnitude, you can't add numbers beyond the magnitude. For example, if you had 127 and -1, adding them would give 126, which is okay, but if you had 127 and -128, adding them would give -1, which is still representable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in Sign and magnitude, the minimum magnitude is 1, so you can't represent 0. But in this case, 67 is fine.

Wait, wait, maybe when adding 109 and -42, which is 67, in Sign and magnitude, the resulting number is 67, but if the system only allows magnitude of up to 127, but 67 is 01001011, which is within 7 bits, so it's okay.

Wait, I'm still not understanding why the correct answer is C. Maybe the test is considering something else.

Wait, perhaps in Sign and magnitude, the number is represented with the sign bit and magnitude, which together take 8 bits, but when adding, do we have to handle carry-over or something?

Wait, 109 is 0 01101101, which is 109, and -42 is 1 00101010. Adding them:

First, add the magnitude: 01101101 + 00101010 = 01001011 (67). Then, since one is positive and the other is negative, set the sign to negative: 10001011. So, the sum is 10001011, which is 8 bits. So, that's okay.

Wait, but is there another way to represent -42 in Sign and magnitude? Because -42 in 8-bit Sign and magnitude is 10001010. So, when you add 01101101 and 10001010, you have to make sure that you add the magnitude correctly.

Wait, let me write it down:

```
    0 01101101 (109)
+   1 00101010 (-42)
--------------
```

Adding the magnitude: 01101101 + 00101010 = 01001011 (67).

Since one is positive and one is negative, the result is negative.

So, set the sign bit to 1 and keep the magnitude as 01001011, which is 67. But 01001011 is 7 bits, so as an 8-bit word, it's 10001011.

That's correct, and it's within the 8-bit range.

So, why is the correct answer C? Maybe I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum being within range, but whether the addition can be performed without causing an overflow during the addition process.

But 109 + (-42) = 67, which is a positive number. In all three representations, adding 109 and -42 can be done within 8 bits.

Wait, unless in Sign and magnitude, negative numbers are represented differently. But in this case, we have a clear 8-bit representation for both numbers.

Wait, maybe in Sign and magnitude, you can't have leading zeros, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps in Sign and magnitude, the numbers are stored with the sign bit and magnitude, but when adding, if the sum's magnitude exceeds the bit limit, it's not representable.

But 67 is within 7 bits, so it's okay.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in Sign and magnitude, the magnitude can only represent numbers from 0 to 127, but in Two's complement, you can represent all numbers from -128 to 127, including negative numbers in a more efficient way.

Wait, no, in Sign and magnitude, you can represent both positive and negative numbers with the same range.

Wait, is there a difference in the range of addition?

Wait, let me think about the maximum sums. In Two's complement, 127 + (-1) = 126, which is within the range. In Sign and magnitude, 127 + (-1) = 126 as well.

Wait, but perhaps in Sign and magnitude, adding two numbers may require more than 8 bits because you have to handle the sign separately.

Wait, but in this specific case, the result is 67, which is 6 bits. So, as an 8-bit number, it's fine.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Maybe the correct answer is C because in Sign and magnitude, the addition of 109 and -42 is within the range, but the question is considering something else.

Wait, let me check the ranges again.

In One's complement: -128 to 127.

In Two's complement: -128 to 127.

In Sign and magnitude: -128 to 127.

So, all three can represent 109 and -42. Their sum is 67, which is also within all three ranges.

But the correct answer is C, meaning I and II only. So, perhaps the confusion is that in Sign and magnitude, the numbers are fixed in their bits, so adding them might require more than 8 bits?

Wait, 109 is 01101101 and -42 is 10001010. Adding them:

  01101101
+ 10001010
------------
= 11100111? Wait, no, let me do the binary addition properly.

Wait, wait, 01101101 (109) + 10001010 (-42):

Convert to decimal:

109 + (-42) = 67.

In binary:

109 is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 64 + 32 = 96, +8=104, +4=108, +1=109. So, 109 is 0b1101101.

-42 is -42. Let's convert -42 to binary in 8 bits.

42 is 32 + 8 + 2
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this question about number representations in 8-bit words, and I need to figure out which representations allow the addition of 109 and -42 to stay within range. The options are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The answer is said to be C, which is I and II only. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what each of these representations means.

**One's Complement:**
This is a method where the number is represented by its binary complement. The one's complement of a number is obtained by flipping all the bits (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s). This is often used in some early methods of subtraction, but I don't think it's used for addition. In one's complement notation, numbers are represented with an implicit sign bit, but it's not as efficient for arithmetic operations, especially addition and subtraction.

**Two's Complement:**
This is a more common method, especially for computers. The two's complement is obtained by flipping the bits of the one's complement and adding 1. This gives a signed binary number, which can represent both positive and negative integers. The key advantage of two's complement is that it can represent negative numbers without an extra sign bit. When you add two numbers in two's complement, you can handle overflow and underflow properly, making it suitable for arithmetic operations.

**Sign and Magnitude:**
This method represents positive numbers as usual, but for negative numbers, the sign bit is set to 1, and the magnitude is stored in the remaining bits. Addition in sign and magnitude can be a bit tricky because you have to handle the sign separately. When adding two numbers, you have to consider if there's a carryover from the magnitude bits that affects the sign bit. This can lead to more complex logic and potential errors if not handled properly.

Okay, so the question is about adding 109 and -42. Let's think about how each of these representations would handle this addition.

First, let's figure out the binary representations of 109 and -42 in each of the given systems.

But before that, let me note that in 8-bit representations, the numbers are limited to 8 bits. So, both positive and negative numbers are represented in 8 bits, which implies that there is a fixed number of possible values (256 for unsigned, 256 signed when using two's complement). 

**Adding 109 and -42:**
109 is a positive number, -42 is negative. Let's consider their sum: 109 + (-42) = 67. So, in a system where addition is straightforward, the result should be 67.

But in different number representations, the process of adding 109 and -42 might not be as straightforward.

Let me start with **One's Complement**.

**One's Complement Addition:**
Adding two numbers in one's complement is done by adding their one's complements. So, to add 109 and -42, we would convert both to their one's complement and then add them. But wait, in one's complement, numbers are represented with an implicit sign bit, but for 8 bits, the range is from 0 to 255 for unsigned or -128 to 127 for signed. Hmm, actually, in one's complement, the range is actually from -128 to 127 for 8-bit numbers because the most significant bit is the sign bit.

Wait, but when adding two numbers in one's complement, adding their one's complements would result in the sum, but since one's complement is not a signed system, actually, I might be getting confused here.

Hold on, maybe I need to think differently.

In one's complement, each number is represented as its complement, but in addition, you can perform the addition directly on the complemented values.

So, to add 109 and -42 in one's complement, we can represent both numbers as 8-bit one's complements and then add them.

But let's get their binary representations.

First, 109 in binary is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109. So, 64 is 2^6, which is 64, 32 is 2^5 (32), so 64+32=96. 109 - 96 =13. 13 is 8+4+1. So, 109 is 1101101 in binary. Wait, let me confirm:

64: 1
32: 1
16: 0
8: 1
4: 1
2: 0
1: 1

So, 64 + 32 = 96, 96 + 8 = 104, 104 + 4 = 108, 108 +1 = 109. So, yes, 1101101.

Now, -42 in one's complement. Hmm, to get the one's complement of -42, do I flip the bits of 42 and then subtract from 255? Wait, no. In one's complement, the representation of negative numbers is done by taking the two's complement, but wait, hold on.

Wait, I'm getting confused. In two's complement, negative numbers are obtained by flipping the bits and adding 1, which is the two's complement. In one's complement, the representation is similar, but the two's complement is just one's complement plus 1.

Wait, in one's complement, the range of numbers is from -128 to 127 for 8 bits. So, to represent -42 in one's complement, we need to find its one's complement.

First, converting -42 to its one's complement in 8 bits:

Convert -42 to its binary in two's complement, then flip the bits to get one's complement.

So, let me find the two's complement of -42.

In two's complement, -42 is represented as 11101010.

To get one's complement, flip all bits: 00010101.

So, 00010101 is the one's complement of -42, which is 21 in decimal. Because 00010101 is 16 + 4 + 1 = 21.

Wait, so in one's complement, -42 is represented as 21? That seems confusing because 21 is a positive number. Hmm, in one's complement, numbers are represented as their complement, but the sign bit indicates the sign. So, in 8 bits, the first bit is the sign bit. So, if it's 00010101, the sign bit is 0, meaning it's positive. So, that represents 21, not -42.

Wait, so in one's complement, the number is equal to 2^8 - complement. So, the complement of 21 is 255 -21=234, and 234 +1=235? Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how one's complement works.

Wait, 8-bit one's complement can represent numbers from -128 to 127, right? So, to represent -42, you need to find its one's complement. So, the two's complement of 42 is 255 -42=213, so -42 is 213 in one's complement. Because in two's complement, -x is equal to ~x +1, so ~42 +1=213, which is one's complement.

Wait, no, wait. Let's get this straight.

In two's complement, to get the representation of a negative number, you take the complement (one's complement) and add 1. So, for -42, two's complement is ~42 +1.

Compute 42 in binary: 32 +8 +2=42, which is 00101010.

Taking one's complement: 11010101, which is 213 in decimal.

Then, add 1: 213 +1=214, which is 11010110. Wait, so 214 is the two's complement of -42. So, in two's complement, -42 is 214.

But in one's complement, how is -42 represented?

Is it the same as two's complement minus 1?

Wait, no, because one's complement is just flipping all the bits. So, for -42, if two's complement is 214, then one's complement is 255 -214=41.

Wait, 214 in binary is 11010110, so 255 -214=41, which is 00101001.

Wait, so -42 in one's complement is 41?

But 41 is positive. Wait, how does the sign bit work?

In one's complement, the sign is determined by the most significant bit. So, if the first bit is 1, the number is negative; if it's 0, it's positive.

So, 41 in binary is 00101001, which is positive. So, in one's complement, -42 is represented as 00101001, which is 41, but with the sign bit indicating negative? Wait, but in 8 bits, 00101001 starts with 0, which is positive.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me recall that in one's complement, the range is from -128 to 127 for 8 bits. So, -128 is 10000000, which is 128 in one's complement. So, to get -42 in one's complement, let's compute it as 128 -42=86? Wait, 128 -42=86, so is -42 represented as 86 in one's complement?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in two's complement, the range is from -128 to 127, but in one's complement, the same.

Wait, actually, in one's complement, the maximum positive number is 127 (01111111), and the minimum is -128 (10000000). So, to get -42 in one's complement, we need to find the binary complement of 42 and then subtract from 128?

Wait, let me check.

Wait, 42 in binary is 00101010.

One's complement is 11010101, which is 213.

So, in one's complement, 213 is -42? Because 128 (10000000) is -128, so 213 is 128 +85=213, so 85 more than -128 is -43, not -42. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps subtract from 256.

Wait, 213 is 256 -43=213, so is 213 equal to -43 in one's complement?

Wait, so -43 in one's complement is 213, and -42 would be 213 +1=214? But 214 is the two's complement of -42. Wait, so in one's complement, it's not possible to represent -42 as a separate value. Hmm, this is conflicting.

I think my confusion arises from the fact that in two's complement, you can represent negative numbers as separate entities, but in one's complement, you don't have a separate sign bit. So, numbers in one's complement are inherently ambiguous in terms of sign unless you have a sign bit.

Wait, but in 8 bits, in one's complement, the first bit is the sign bit. So, if the first bit is 0, it's positive; if it's 1, it's negative. So, to represent -42, you flip the bits of 42 and set the sign bit to 1.

Wait, but 42 is 00101010, its one's complement is 11010101, which is 213, but if we set the sign bit to 1, making it 11010101, which is 213, which is greater than 128, but in one's complement, numbers greater than 128 are actually negative? Wait, no, that can't be because in one's complement, the minimum value is -128 (10000000). So, 11010101 is 213, but 213 is greater than 128, so in one's complement, that would be a positive number. Wait, but 213 is 128 +85=213, so 85 above -128 is -43, so 213 in one's complement is -43, not -42.

So, in one's complement, you can't represent -42 as a separate value. Instead, -42 is equal to -43 +1, which would be 213 +1=214. But 214 is beyond 128, so in two's complement, 214 represents -42. Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Maybe I need to step back.

**Adding in One's Complement:**
When adding numbers in one's complement, you add their one's complements. So, to add 109 and -42, you convert each to one's complement and add them.

So, 109 in one's complement is 255 -109=146. So, 146 is 10010010 in binary.

-42 in one's complement is 213 (as 213 is -43, but wait, we need -42). Wait, as I was confused earlier, maybe in one's complement, -42 is 213? Because 42 in binary is 00101010, flip bits:11010101, which is 213, and in one's complement, that represents -42? But 213 is 128 +85=213, which is 85 above -128, so -43. So, perhaps -42 is 214? Hmm, maybe in one's complement, you can't represent -42 uniquely.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

If we have 8-bit one's complement, the numbers range from -128 to 127.

So, -42 is within this range, but how is it represented?

In one's complement, to represent -42, you take the two's complement of 42, subtract 1. Wait, no.

Wait, in two's complement, -x = ~x +1.

In one's complement, -x = ~x.

Wait, perhaps in one's complement, negative numbers are represented by inverting all the bits and leaving the sign bit as 1. So, -42 would be the one's complement of 42 with the sign bit set.

But wait, 42 is 00101010, so its one's complement is 11010101, which is 213, but with the sign bit, which is 1, so the number is 11010101. But in one's complement, the sign bit is just part of the number, so 11010101 is 213, which is beyond 128, but in one's complement, numbers above 128 are considered as negative numbers.

Wait, no, in one's complement, the sign is determined by the first bit. So, 11010101 has the first bit as 1, so it's negative. So, the magnitude is 213 -128=85, so it's -85? Wait, no, 213 -128=85, so maybe it's -85?

Wait, but that doesn't match with -42.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should abandon one's complement for now and think about how addition works.

Wait, when adding two numbers in one's complement, you just add their one's complements, right?

So, 109 + (-42) in one's complement is equal to (one's complement of 109) + (one's complement of -42).

Wait, but one's complement of -42 is equal to the two's complement of 42, which is 213.

So, one's complement of -42 is 213? Or is it different?

Wait, if in two's complement, -42 is 214, then its one's complement is 255 -214=41.

Wait, so in one's complement, -42 is 41?

But 41 is positive. Hmm, this is where I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I need to accept that in one's complement, negative numbers are represented as the one's complement of their positive counterparts, but in an 8-bit system, you can't represent -42 uniquely because it's a non-power of two. So, perhaps adding in one's complement doesn't allow for exact negative numbers, making arithmetic operations error-prone.

But the question is about whether the addition of 109 and -42 is within range. So, let's think about it in terms of the system.

In one's complement, with 8 bits, the numbers range from -128 to 127. So, adding 109 and -42, which is 67, is within the range of 127, so it's okay. But does the addition result in an overflow or underflow?

Wait, if we add 109 and -42, we get 67. So, 67 is within the range of 8-bit one's complement, because 67 is less than 127.

But the way addition works in one's complement is by adding the one's complements. So, 109 is 146 in one's complement (255 -109=146). -42 in one's complement is 213 (since 213 is the two's complement of 42, which is 42's negative). So, adding 146 and 213 in one's complement.

146 +213=359. Now, 359 in one's complement, with 8 bits, is 359-256=103. So, 103 is the result.

But 103 is not equal to 67. So, the addition is incorrect because of the way one's complement works.

Wait, maybe that's why the sum is not in range? Wait, no, 103 is still within the range of one's complement (since it's between -128 and 127). Wait, 103 is positive.

Wait, 146 +213=359, which is 359-256=103. So, 103 is the result. But 103 is not equal to 67.

So, in one's complement, the addition of 109 and -42 gives 103 instead of 67, which is incorrect. So, in this case, the addition would not result in the correct value, but maybe it's within the range.

So, is the result within range? Since 103 is within -128 to 127, yes, it's within range. So, perhaps, in one's complement, the addition is within range, but incorrect.

But the question is about whether the addition is within range, not necessarily correct.

Wait, but the question says: "the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?"

So, if in one's complement, 109 + (-42) results in 103, which is within the range of one's complement numbers (8-bit one's complement). So, it's within range. So, in that case, the answer would be that it's within range.


[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this question here about different number representations and addition. It's about figuring out in which of the given representations (one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude) the addition of 109 and -42 stays within the range of an 8-bit word. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. I, II, and III. The correct answer is said to be C, but I want to understand why.

First, I need to recall what each of these representations means. Let me jot down what I remember:

1. **One's complement**: This is a method to represent negative numbers in binary. For an 8-bit word, you take the 8-bit binary representation of the positive number and complement it (change all 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s). This gives the one's complement, which is the negative of that number.

2. **Two's complement**: This is similar to one's complement but with an additional step. After finding the one's complement, you add 1 to get the two's complement. This is the standard way to represent negative numbers in systems like 8-bit computers. It also allows for easy addition of negative numbers by complementing and adding.

3. **Sign and magnitude**: This is another method where the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. If the MSB is 0, the number is positive; if it's 1, the number is negative. The rest of the bits represent the magnitude, or the absolute value of the number.

So, the question is about adding 109 and -42 in each of these representations and seeing if the result stays within the 8-bit range.

But wait, I think I need to translate these numbers into their respective representations first.

Let me start with an 8-bit one's complement representation.

**Converting to One's Complement:**

First, represent 109 and -42 in 8-bit one's complement.

But wait, actually, in one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their complement, and negative numbers are the complement of their positive counterparts.

But hang on, 109 in positive is already a positive number. So, in one's complement, 109 would be its complement. Let me calculate that.

8-bit binary for 109: Let me compute that.

128 is 2^7, which is 128. 64 is 64, 32 is 32, 16 is 16, 8 is 8, 4 is 4, 2 is 2, 1 is 1.

109 divided by 128 is less than 1, so starting from 64:

109 - 64 = 45

45 - 32 = 13

13 - 8 = 5

5 - 4 = 1

1 - 1 = 0

So, the binary representation is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109. Let's write it out:

64 (2^6) is 1000000

32 (2^5) is 0100000

8 (2^3) is 001000

4 (2^2) is 000100

1 (2^0) is 000001

Adding all these together: 1000000 + 0100000 = 1100000

1100000 + 001000 = 1110000

1110000 + 000100 = 1111000

1111000 + 000001 = 1111001

So, 109 in 8-bit binary is 01111001? Wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Wait, 64 is 1000000, but in 8 bits, it's 01000000.

Wait, maybe I should write all 8 bits.

Let me do 109 in 8 bits:

109 in decimal is:

128 is too big, so highest bit is 64.

109 - 64 = 45.

So first bit (128's place): 0

Second bit (64's place): 1

Third bit (32's place): 45 -32=13, so 1

Fourth bit (16's place): 13-16 would be negative, so 0

Fifth bit (8's place): 13 -8=5, so 1

Sixth bit (4's place): 5 -4=1, so 1

Seventh bit (2's place):1 -2 would be negative, so 0

Eighth bit (1's place):1, so 1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 8 bits: 0-7.

Wait, let's do it step by step:

Start with 109.

Divide by 128: 0, remainder 109.

Divide by 64: 1, remainder 45.

Divide by 32: 1, remainder 13.

Divide by 16: 0, remainder 13.

Divide by 8:1, remainder 5.

Divide by 4:1, remainder 1.

Divide by 2:0, remainder 1.

Divide by 1:1, remainder 0.

So, the binary is 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1.

Wait, let me write it backwards because we usually write the least significant bit first.

Wait, no, in 8 bits, it's:

Starting from 128: 0

64:1

32:1

16:0

8:1

4:1

2:0

1:1

So, writing from highest to lowest, it's 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1, which is 01101101.

Wait, let me check: 64 +32 +8 +4 +1= 109? 64+32=96, 96+8=104, 104+4=108, 108+1=109. Yes, correct.

So, in one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their complement. So, to get 109 in one's complement, it would be the complement of 01101101.

Complement is 10010010.

Wait, let's do it.

Each bit is flipped:

0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0.

Original: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

Complement: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

So, 10010010.

So, 109 in one's complement is 10010010.

Similarly, -42 in one's complement: to get the one's complement of 42.

First, represent 42 in 8 bits.

42 is 32 + 8 + 2, which is 32 + 8 + 2.

So, 32 is 2^5, 8 is 2^3, 2 is 2^1.

So, binary: 00101010.

Wait, let me verify: 32 is 32, 42-32=10. 8 is next, 10-8=2. Then 2 is 2. So, 32 +8 +2=42.

In 8 bits: 00101010.

So, one's complement is flipping all bits:

11010101.

So, -42 in one's complement is 11010101.

So, now, adding 109 (10010010) and -42 (11010101) in one's complement.

To add them in one's complement:

First, add the two numbers as 8-bit numbers, treating them as signed.

So, let's perform binary addition:

10010010 (109)

+11010101 (-42)

Let me write them down:

  1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
+1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
------------------

Let's add them bit by bit, starting from the right:

Bit 0 (LSB): 0 +1=1

Bit1:1 +0=1

Bit2:0 +1=1

Bit3:0 +0=0

Bit4:1 +1=0 (carryover 1)

Bit5:0 +0 +1 (carryover)=1

Bit6:0 +1=1

Bit7:1 +1=0 (carryover 1, but since it's the MSB, we ignore the carryover)

Wait, let me step through each bit:

Starting from the right:

Bit 7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (but we ignore carryover beyond 8 bits)

Bit6:0 +0=0, plus carryover 1=1

Wait, maybe my bit order is reversed. Wait, in binary addition, usually, we start from the right (LSB) and move to the left.

Wait, but when writing the numbers, the leftmost bit is MSB.

So, perhaps I should align them:

  1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
+1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
------------------

Starting from the right:

Bit 0: 0 +1=1

Bit1:1 +0=1

Bit2:0 +1=1

Bit3:1 +0=1

Bit4:0 +1=1

Bit5:0 +0=0

Bit6:0 +1=1

Bit7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (which we ignore)

So, the sum is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, which is 11111111.

Wait, but 11111111 in one's complement is -1, because in one's complement, all 1s represent -1.

So, adding 109 and -42 in one's complement gives -1. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, 109 + (-42) is 67, which is within 8-bit range, right? Because 67 is less than 128.

But in one's complement, the result is -1, which is outside the range if we're considering only positive numbers.

Wait, but wait. In one's complement, the range is from -128 to +127. So, -1 is within that range. But the actual sum in decimal is 67, but in one's complement, it's represented as -1.

So, is 67 within the 8-bit one's complement range? Yes, but it's not the same as the actual sum. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: When adding in one's complement, do we treat the result as a signed number?

So, in one's complement, when you add two numbers, you can get a result that's either positive or negative. So, in this case, the sum is 11111111, which is -1.

But 109 + (-42) is 67, which is within the 8-bit range if we consider the actual decimal number. But in one's complement, the representation is -1, which is a valid value but not the same as 67.

However, the question is: is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range? So, does that mean the operation stays within the 8-bit word range?

In one's complement, the numbers are represented as 8-bit words, and adding them results in an 8-bit word. So, the result is within the 8-bit word range because it's only 8 bits. The value is -1, which is within the one's complement range of -128 to 127.

So, in that sense, yes, the addition is within range. But is that what the question is asking? Or is it asking if the actual decimal result is within the 8-bit range?

Wait, the question says: "the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range". So, I think it refers to whether the addition operation, when performed in that representation, results in a number that is within the 8-bit word range.

So, in one's complement, 109 is represented as 10010010, -42 as 11010101, adding them gives 11111111, which is an 8-bit word (since it's 8 bits). So, yes, it's within range.

Similarly, in two's complement, let's do the same addition.

So, let's convert 109 and -42 into two's complement.

First, 109 in two's complement:

To find two's complement, take the one's complement and add 1.

We already have one's complement of 109 as 10010010.

Adding 1 to that:

10010010 + 1 = 10010111.

So, 109 in two's complement is 10010111.

Similarly, -42 in two's complement:

We had one's complement of 42 as 11010101.

Adding 1 to that gives two's complement:

11010101 + 1 = 11010110.

So, -42 in two's complement is 11010110.

Now, adding these two two's complement numbers:

10010111 (109)
+11010110 (-42)
------------------

Let me add them:

  1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
+1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
------------------

Starting from the right:

Bit0:1 +0=1

Bit1:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit2:1 +1 +1=1, carryover 0

Bit3:0 +0=0

Bit4:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit5:0 +0 +1=1

Bit6:0 +1=1

Bit7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (ignore)

So, the result is 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1.

Wait, let me go step by step:

Bit7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (ignored)

Bit6:0 +1=1, no carryover

Bit5:1 +0=1, no carryover

Bit4:0 +1=1, no carryover

Bit3:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit2:1 +1 + carryover 1=1, carryover 0

Bit1:1 +0=1, no carryover

Bit0:1 +0=1

Wait, maybe I should write it in a table.

But let me do it as 8 bits:

Starting from the right:

Bit0: 1 +0=1

Bit1:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit2:1 +1=0 + carryover 1=1, carryover 0

Bit3:0 +0=0

Bit4:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit5:0 +0=0 + carryover 1=1, carryover 0

Bit6:0 +1=1

Bit7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (ignore)

So, the result is 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0? Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me align the numbers:

        1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
      +1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
      -------------------
Starting from the right:

Bit0: 1 +0=1

Bit1:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit2:1 +1=0, plus carryover 1=1, carryover 0

Bit3:0 +0=0

Bit4:1 +1=0, carryover 1

Bit5:0 +0=0, plus carryover 1=1, carryover 0

Bit6:0 +1=1

Bit7:1 +1=0, carryover 1 (ignored)

So, writing the result from Bit7 to Bit0: 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1.

Wait, 01101011.

So, 01101011 in two's complement is what? Let's convert it back to decimal.

128's place:0

64's place:1*64=64

32's place:1*32=32

16's place:0*16=0

8's place:1*8=8

4's place:0*4=0

2's place:1*2=2

1's place:1*1=1

Adding these up:64 +32 +8 +2 +1=107.

Wait, but 109 + (-42)=67, so either I made a mistake in the addition or the conversion.

Wait, let me check the two's complement addition again.

Wait, 10010111 (109) + 11010110 (-42):

Let's add the binary numbers:

10010111
+11010110
=?

Adding each column:

Start from right:

1. 1 +0=1
2. 1 +1=0, carryover 1
3. 1 +1 +1=1, carryover 0
4. 0 +0=0
5. 1 +1=0, carryover 1
6. 0 +0 +1=1, carryover 0
7. 0 +1=1
8. 1 +1=0, carryover 1 (ignored)

So, the result is 01101011.

Wait, 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1.

Wait, so that's 64 +32 +8 +2 +1=107.

But 109 + (-42)=67. So, why is the result 107?

Wait, is my two's complement conversion wrong?

Wait, 10010111 is 109. Let me verify.

In two's complement, 10010111 is 128 + (-19)=109? Wait, no, two's complement is calculated as:

Take the 8-bit binary, subtract twice the smallest bit.

Wait, 10010111.

To get the decimal value, you can calculate:

128 + ( - (2^0)*1 - 2^1*1 - 2^2*1 - 2^3*0 - 2^4*1 - 2^5*0 - 2^
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about different number representations in 8-bit words, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is C, meaning only One's complement and Two's complement are suitable for adding 109 and -42 without going out of range. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what each of these representations means: One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. I remember that One's complement is a method used to represent negative numbers in binary, where each bit is flipped. For example, if I have a positive number, its one's complement is the binary representation of that number subtracted from all 1s. Similarly, Two's complement is similar but involves adding 1 to the one's complement to get the two's complement, which is used to represent negative numbers in systems that use two's complement, which is common in computing.

Sign and magnitude is another way to represent numbers, where the sign bit is separate from the magnitude. So, for positive numbers, the sign bit is 0, and for negative, it's 1. The magnitude is just the absolute value of the number, represented in binary.

Now, the question is about adding 109 and -42 in each of these representations and whether the result stays within range. So, 8-bit words mean we have 8 bits, which can represent numbers from -128 to 127 in two's complement. But in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127, and in sign and magnitude, the range is actually different because it's more about the number of bits.

Wait, hold on. I think in sign and magnitude, each number is represented as a sign bit (1 bit) and the magnitude (7 bits). So, in that case, the range would be from -128 (if sign is negative) to 127 (if sign is positive). But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Actually, in sign and magnitude, the number is represented by a sign bit and the magnitude, which is an unsigned number. So, if the magnitude is 7 bits, the maximum magnitude is 127. So, the total range is from -128 to 127. So, that's similar to two's complement. Hmm, interesting.

But wait, for numbers beyond 127 or below -128, you would need more than 8 bits. So, in an 8-bit sign and magnitude, you can only represent numbers from -128 to 127, same as two's complement. So, that's an important point.

Now, the numbers we are dealing with are 109 and -42. Both of these are within the range of 8-bit two's complement, because 109 is less than 127, and -42 is greater than -128. So, both are within the representable range.

But the question is about adding them in each of the three representations: One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The question is whether the addition is within range, which I think refers to whether the result is within the representable range of the given representation.

So, perhaps in each representation, we need to see if adding 109 and -42 would result in a number that can be represented within the 8-bit word.

First, let's consider Two's complement because it's commonly used in computers. In two's complement, adding two numbers is straightforward because the representation inherently includes the sign as part of the value. So, adding 109 and -42 should result in 67. Let me verify that: 109 + (-42) = 67. So, 67 is within the range of an 8-bit two's complement number since -128 < 67 < 127. So Two's complement definitely works.

Now, what about One's complement? One's complement is a bit different. It doesn't store the sign separately; instead, it uses the complement of the number to represent negative values. So, to add 109 and -42 in one's complement, I think I need to represent both numbers as one's complements and then add them.

First, let me find the one's complement of 109. The one's complement of a positive number is equal to 2^n - number, where n is the number of bits. Since we have 8-bit one's complement, the maximum number is 127 (all ones). So, one's complement of 109 is 127 - 109 = 18. So, in one's complement, 109 is represented as 18.

Similarly, to represent -42 in one's complement, I take the absolute value, which is 42, and then compute the one's complement. So, one's complement of 42 is 127 - 42 = 85. So, in one's complement, -42 is represented as 85.

Now, adding the two one's complements: 18 + 85 = 103. So, the result is 103. Now, in one's complement, numbers are interpreted as negative if the sign bit is 1. Wait, but in one's complement, how do we know whether the result is positive or negative? Because in one's complement, 0 is considered positive, and any non-zero number is negative.

Wait, no, actually, in one's complement, the way it's usually taught is that 0 is positive, and any non-zero number is negative. So, if I add 18 and 85, I get 103. But 103 is non-zero, so it would be considered negative. So, how do I interpret 103 as a negative number?

In one's complement, to get the actual value, you have to take the two's complement of the result. So, to convert 103 one's complement back to two's complement, you take the complement and add 1.

Wait, but in one's complement, the two's complement is the same as one's complement plus 1. So, if I have a number in one's complement, to get its two's complement, I add 1, which effectively flips all the bits and adds 1, giving me the two's complement.

But in this case, since we're dealing with the sum of two numbers in one's complement, the resulting number is 103. But is 103 within the representable range?

Wait, in one's complement, the range is from -127 to 127. So, 103 is within that range because 127 is the maximum positive number, and -127 is the minimum.

But since 103 is non-zero, it's considered negative in one's complement. So, if I add 109 and -42 in one's complement, I get 103, which is representable as a negative number in one's complement. So, perhaps the addition is within range? Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the question is about whether the addition can be done without overflow. Because in one's complement, adding two numbers can sometimes lead to an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum or goes below the minimum. Let me check that.

So, 109 is represented as 18, and -42 is 85. Adding them gives 103, which is within 0 to 127. So, that's fine.

But wait, in one's complement, numbers are represented in such a way that when you add them, you can get results that wrap around. So, for example, if the sum exceeds 127 or goes below 0, it wraps around. But in this case, 18 + 85 is 103, which is less than 127, so no overflow occurs. So, the addition is fine.

Wait, but hold on. If the result is 103, which is non-zero, it's considered negative. But when we add 109 and -42, we expect 67 as the result. So, is 103 equivalent to 67 in two's complement?

Wait, maybe I need to convert 103 back to two's complement to see what it represents. Let's try that. To convert 103 from one's complement to two's complement, I can take the one's complement of 103, which is 127 - 103 = 24, and then add 1 to get 25. So, 25 in two's complement is equal to 67 in decimal because 64 + 1 = 65? Wait, 64 is 64, 64 + 1 is 65, 64 + 2 is 66, 64 + 3 is 67. Wait, no, 25 is 16 + 8 + 1, which is 25. Wait, that's not quite right. Wait, 25 in binary is 00011001, which is 16 + 8 + 1, which is 25. So, in two's complement, 25 is equal to -91, because 25 is 2^7 - 91 = 128 - 91 = 37, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about 25 in two's complement 8-bit is equal to - (128 - 25) = -103. So, 25 in two's complement is -103. So, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I messed up the conversion. Let me try again.

In two's complement, to convert a number from one's complement, you flip all the bits and then add 1. So, 103 in one's complement is 00011001. Flipping the bits gives 11100110, which is 250 in decimal? Wait, no, 8 bits: 11100110 is 128 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 128 + 64 is 192, plus 16 is 208, plus 4 is 212? Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, 11100110 is 128 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 128 + 64 is 192, 192 + 16 is 208, 208 + 4 is 212. Hmm, that's way beyond 8 bits. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently.

Wait, 11100110 is 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2. So, 128 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 212. Then, adding 1 gives us 213, but that doesn't make sense because we're converting from one's complement.

Wait, actually, when converting from one's complement to two's complement, you flip all the bits and then add 1. So, the process is:

1. Take the one's complement number (103).
2. Flip all the bits to get the two's complement.
3. Add 1 to get the final two's complement.

Wait, but in this case, since 103 is in one's complement, flipping the bits would give 24 (since 127 - 103 = 24), and then adding 1 to get 25. So, 25 in two's complement is equal to -103, right? Because 25 is 128 - 103 = 25, so yes, it's -103.

Wait, so adding 109 and -42 in one's complement gives me 103, which is equivalent to -103 in two's complement. That's not the same as adding them normally. So, does that mean that the result is incorrect? Or is it just a different representation?

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. When adding numbers in one's complement, you have to consider that the result is interpreted as a one's complement number, which could be positive or negative.

So, if I add 18 (which is 109 in one's complement) and 85 (which is -42 in one's complement), I get 103. Then, interpreting 103 as a one's complement number, it's non-zero, so it's considered negative. To find the actual value, I take the two's complement of 103, which is 25, which is -103 in two's complement. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe my whole approach is wrong. Perhaps I should instead represent both numbers in one's complement, add them in one's complement, and then convert the result back to two's complement to see if it's equal to 67.

Let me try that.

109 in one's complement is 127 - 109 = 18.

-42 in one's complement is 127 - 42 = 85.

Adding 18 + 85 = 103.

Now, in one's complement, the result is 103. So, 103 is a one's complement number, which is negative because it's non-zero. To get the actual value, I need to take the two's complement of 103.

So, two's complement of 103 is 127 - 103 = 24, then add 1 to get 25.

25 in two's complement is equal to -103, but 109 + (-42) is 67, not -103. So, that doesn't match.

Wait, so that suggests that adding 109 and -42 in one's complement doesn't give the expected result? That seems odd. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check. If 109 is 18 in one's complement, then adding 18 and 85 (which is -42) gives 103. Then, interpreting 103 in one's complement, since it's non-zero, it's a negative number. So, we take two's complement of 103 to get its actual value, which is 25, as above.

But 25 is -103, not 67. So, that's not the right result. Hmm. That suggests that in one's complement, addition doesn't work as expected, or perhaps that the result is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I should directly convert both numbers to two's complement and then add them. Wait, 109 in two's complement is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109. Wait, 64 is 64, 64 + 32 is 96, 96 + 8 is 104, 104 + 4 is 108, 108 + 1 is 109. So, 109 is 0b1101101.

Wait, but in 8 bits, 109 is 01101101.

Similarly, -42 in two's complement is 01101101 subtracted from 10000000.

Wait, 10000000 - 01101101 = 10011111.

So, 10011111 is -42 in two's complement.

Now, adding 01101101 (109) and 10011111 (-42):

Let's do the addition:

01101101
+10011111
= ?

Adding bit by bit:

Starting from the right:

1 + 1 = 10, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 10, carryover 1.

1 + 1 + 1 = 11, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 = 10, carryover 1.

1 + 0 + 1 = 10, carryover 1.

0 + 0 + 1 = 1, carryover 0.

1 + 0 = 1.

0 + 1 = 1.

Wait, let me write it down properly:

```
  01101101
+ 10011111
-----------
```

Starting from the right (LSB):

1. 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.
2. 0 + 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.
3. 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carryover 1.
4. 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carryover 1.
5. 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, carryover 0.
6. 1 + 0 = 1, no carryover.
7. 0 + 1 = 1.
8. 0 + 1 = 1.

Wait, so the result is 11100110, which is 212 in decimal. Hmm, but 212 is beyond 8 bits. Wait, but 8 bits can only go up to 127. So, 212 is outside the range.

Wait, so if we have an overflow, that is, the sum exceeds 127. So, in two's complement, adding two numbers that sum to more than 127 would cause an overflow, which wraps around.

Wait, but in two's complement, does the addition wrap around? Let me think.

Wait, no, in two's complement arithmetic, addition doesn't wrap around. Instead, it's a standard signed-digit representation. So, if the sum is beyond 127, it's just represented as a negative number.

Wait, but 212 is beyond 127, so in two's complement, 212 is equivalent to 212 - 128 = 84, but wait, no.

Wait, in two's complement, the value of the number is equal to the number minus 128 if it's negative, but if it's positive, it's just the number. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, each bit in two's complement represents a power of two, so 128 is 2^7. So, 212 is 128 + 64 + 16 + 4, which is 212. So, 212 is a positive number, but in 8 bits, that's not representable because the maximum is 127. So, 212 is outside the 8-bit range.

Wait, that can't be. 8-bit two's complement can represent numbers from -128 to 127. So, 212 is beyond 127, so it's not representable. So, in that case, adding 109 and -42 in two's complement would result in an overflow because the result is 212, which is outside the representable range.

Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought that adding 109 and -42 in two's complement gives 67. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition.

Let me recalculate the addition step by step.

Adding 01101101 (109) and 10011111 (-42) in two's complement.

Let me write it down:

  01101101
+10011111
-----------
Starting from the right:

1. Rightmost bit: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1.
2. Next bit: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 with carryover 1.
3. Next: 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 with carryover 1.
4. Next: 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 with carryover 1.
5. Next: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 with no carryover.
6. Next:
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how to represent the addition of 109 and -42 using different number systems, specifically in an 8-bit word. The question is asking which of the given representations—One's complement, Two's complement, or Sign and magnitude— allows the addition to stay within range. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, and D. I, II, and III. The correct answer is supposed to be C, I and II only. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is the case.

Let me start by recalling what each of these representations means. I know that in computing, especially with fixed-width integers, different methods are used to represent both positive and negative numbers. One's complement and Two's complement are the primary methods used for this, while Sign and magnitude is a more straightforward method but lacks the ability to directly add negative numbers without some kind of mechanism.

First, let me think about what each method does. The Sign and magnitude method represents numbers with a sign bit and the magnitude in the remaining bits. For example, to add 109 and -42, I would need to represent -42 in sign and magnitude. So, the sign bit would be 1 (assuming negative), and the magnitude would be 42. But when adding numbers in sign and magnitude, you have to handle the sign bit separately. So, in 8-bit representation, 109 in sign and magnitude would be 01110011, and -42 would be 11100110. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 42 in binary is 00101010, so with the sign bit, it becomes 11100110 for 8 bits. So, when adding them, I have to add 109 (01110011) and -42 (11100110). But how does addition work in sign and magnitude? Do I have to flip the bits where there's a carryover?

Actually, to add two numbers in sign and magnitude, you add their magnitude parts, and if the sum overflows, you take the carryover as the negative result. So, let me compute the magnitude addition: 109 is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 109. Wait, 64 is 64, so 64 + 32 is 96, plus 8 is 104, plus 4 is 108, plus 1 is 109. So, in binary, 109 is 01110011.

-42 is represented as 11100110. So, the magnitude part is 00101010 (which is 42), and the sign is negative. Now, adding 109 (01110011) and -42 (11100110). Let me add their magnitude parts:

  01110011
+ 00101010
= ?

Let me do the addition bit by bit:

Starting from the right:
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10, so write 0, carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 1 = 1

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again:

Rightmost bit: 1 + 0 = 1
Next: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
Next: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
Next: 0 + 1 = 1
Next: 1 + 0 = 1
Next: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1
Next: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
Leftmost bit: 0 + 0 = 0

Wait, so putting it together:

Leftmost bit: 0
Then 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1
So, 01011011?

Wait, but that's 91, right? Let me check 01011011. 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 64+16=80+8=88+2=90+1=91. So, 91.

But the addition is 109 + (-42) = 67. Hmm, so 91 is not 67. So, what did I do wrong? Because in sign and magnitude, if the sum of the magnitude parts overflows, we take the carry as the negative result.

Wait, so maybe the process is: add the magnitude parts, and if there's a carry, that becomes the negative result.

So let's compute 01110011 (109) + 00101010 (42). Adding:

01110011
+00101010
= 01011001 (which is 89). Wait, is that right?

Wait, let me compute 109 + 42 = 151. So, in binary:

109 is 01110011
42 is 00101010
Adding them: 01110011 + 00101010.

Let me do that:

Starting from the right:
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0

So, result is 01011001, which is 89. So, 109 + 42 = 151 is not 89. Wait, maybe I did the addition wrong. 109 + 42 is definitely 151, which is 10010011 in binary.

Wait, maybe my initial problem is that I added 109 and 42, but in the sign and magnitude method, we have to add 109 and the magnitude part of -42, which is 42, so 109 + 42 = 151, which is 10010011. But in 8 bits, that's 10010011, which is 151.

But wait, in the sign and magnitude method, when adding a positive and a negative number, you add their magnitudes and then determine the sign based on the operation. So, since we added 109 + (-42), which is negative, the result should have a sign bit of 1.

But in 8 bits, 151 is 10010011, which is 8 bits, so if we represent 67 in 8 bits, which is 01000011. So, adding 109 (01110011) and -42 (11100110):

Wait, maybe the process is to add 109 and 42, and then invert the bits where there is a carryover.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try another approach. In sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42.

First, represent both numbers in 8 bits.

109 in sign and magnitude is 01110011 (positive, so sign bit is 0).

-42 in sign and magnitude is 11100110 (negative, sign bit is 1).

Now, add the magnitudes: 01110011 + 00101010.

Let me compute that:

  01110011
+ 00101010
= 01011001 (which is 89). So, 89 is the sum of the magnitudes.

Now, since 109 + (-42) = 67, which is positive, so the sign of the result is positive. The magnitude part is 67, which is 01000011 in 8 bits.

Wait, so 89 is larger than 67, so how does that work? In sign and magnitude, if the sum of the magnitudes exceeds the word size, the overflow is handled by considering it as a negative result.

So, 89 is generated from the magnitude addition. Since 89 is greater than the maximum positive value (which is 127 for 8 bits), but 89 is less than 128. Wait, 89 is less than 128. Hmm, maybe it's not about the overflow, but rather when adding the magnitude, if the sum overflows, you take the carryover as the negative result.

Wait, let me clarify. In sign and magnitude, when adding two numbers, you add their magnitudes. If the sum of the magnitudes exceeds the maximum positive value, the carryover is taken as the negative result.

So, in this case, 01110011 + 00101010 = 01011001 (89). Since 89 is less than 128 (the maximum positive value in 8 bits), we don't have an overflow. So, the result is 01011001, but since the operation was a positive plus a negative, the sign of the result is negative if the magnitude sum is greater than the positive number, right? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in sign and magnitude, the result's sign is determined by the operation: positive plus negative is negative, regardless of the magnitude. So, even if the sum of the magnitudes is less than the positive number, the result is negative.

So, 109 + (-42) = 67, which is positive, but in sign and magnitude, adding 01110011 and 11100110 (which is negative 42) would result in a negative number because one operand is positive and the other is negative.

Wait, that's conflicting with the actual arithmetic. Hmm. So, maybe in sign and magnitude, the sign bit is determined by the operation, not the magnitude. So, if you are adding a positive number and a negative number, the result is negative, regardless of the magnitudes.

Therefore, even though 109 + 42 = 151, in sign and magnitude, adding 109 (positive) and -42 (negative) would result in a negative number. So, the result would be a negative number with magnitude 67, which is 01000011, but the sign bit would be 1, making it 11000011, which is -67 in two's complement.

Wait, but that seems contradictory. Because in reality, 109 - 42 = 67, which is positive.

So, perhaps I'm mixing up the operations. In sign and magnitude, the arithmetic is more like decimal subtraction. If you have a positive number and a negative number, adding them is like subtracting their magnitudes.

Wait, that's correct. So, in sign and magnitude, adding a positive and a negative number is equivalent to subtracting their magnitudes.

So, adding 109 (positive) and -42 (negative) is equivalent to 109 - 42 = 67. So, in sign and magnitude, the result should be 67 with a positive sign, but that's not how it works.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me think. In sign and magnitude, to add two numbers, you add their magnitude parts and handle any overflow, and the sign of the result is positive if the number of positive operands is odd and negative otherwise. Wait, is that a thing?

Wait, actually, in sign and magnitude, the sign is determined by the operation, not by the number of positive operands. So, adding a positive and a negative number gives a negative result, regardless of the magnitudes.

So, in this case, 109 is positive, -42 is negative, so the result is negative, with a magnitude of 67. So, the 8-bit representation would be 1 (sign) followed by the magnitude of 67, which is 01000011. So, putting it together, it would be 11000011.

But wait, if 67 is 01000011, then with the sign bit, it's 11000011, which is indeed the two's complement of 67. Because 128 - 67 is 61, which is not 11000011. Wait, 61 is 00111101, so 128 - 67 is 61, so 67 is 128 - 61 = 67, so two's complement is 10011101? Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, actually, the two's complement of a number is just the complement and then add 1. So, to get the two's complement of 67, which is 01000011, the one's complement is 10111100, adding 1 gives 11000011.

So, 11000011 is indeed the two's complement representation of -67, but wait, in this case, adding 109 and -42 in sign and magnitude is equivalent to 109 - 42 = 67, but since the operation was adding a positive and a negative, the result is a negative number, which is -67, whose two's complement is 11000011.

Wait, so the confusion is that in sign and magnitude, you add the magnitudes and then negate the result if the number of negative operands is odd? Or is it that the sign is determined by the number of negative operands?

Wait, I think in sign and magnitude, the sign is determined by the operation itself. So, adding a positive and a negative number results in a negative number, regardless of the magnitude.

So, in our case, 109 + (-42) is equivalent to 109 - 42, which is 67, but in sign and magnitude, since we have one negative operand, the result is negative. So, the magnitude is 67, which is 01000011, and the sign bit is 1, making it 11000011, which is -67 in two's complement.

Wait, so if that's the case, then in sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42 results in -67, which requires 8 bits, but 11000011 is within the 8-bit range, so perhaps sign and magnitude can handle it.

But wait, in sign and magnitude, adding 8-bit numbers, the result can sometimes go beyond 8 bits when adding magnitudes. So, for example, if the sum of the magnitudes is more than 127, you have to carry over to the next higher bit, which would be considered the negative result.

But in our case, 109 + 42 is 151, which is 9 bits, but since we're only using 8 bits, the carryover is 151 - 128 = 23, so the negative result is -23. But 109 + (-42) is 67, which is less than 128, so in sign and magnitude, do we have an overflow?

Wait, maybe not, because 109 + 42 is 151, which is more than 128, so in sign and magnitude, we need to take the overflow as negative. So, 151 - 128 = 23, so -23 is the result.

But wait, that's not correct because 109 + (-42) is 67, not -23. So, maybe sign and magnitude can't handle this addition because the overflow is not directly related to the actual result.

So, perhaps in sign and magnitude, adding 109 and -42 is problematic because the sum of their magnitudes (151) overflows into the ninth bit, but we don't have a ninth bit. So, how is this handled? By considering the overflow as a negative result, the magnitude being 23 and the sign being negative, so the result is -23. But that's not the correct result.

Hmm, so perhaps sign and magnitude cannot correctly handle the addition of numbers where the sum of the magnitudes exceeds the word size without causing an incorrect result. Therefore, in this case, sign and magnitude would incorrectly result in -23 instead of the correct 67.

So, that's a problem. Therefore, adding 109 and -42 in sign and magnitude gives an incorrect result because the magnitude addition overflows, and we don't have a way to handle that without losing information. So, sign and magnitude isn't suitable for this addition because it cannot represent the correct result without overflow.

Therefore, sign and magnitude is not suitable here, so option III is incorrect. So, now, moving on to One's complement and Two's complement.

First, let's recall what One's complement is. One's complement is a method where negative numbers are represented by inverting all the bits of the positive number's magnitude and then adding 1. So, to get the one's complement of a number, you take the complement (0s become 1s and 1s become 0s) and add 1. But in practice, One's complement is often used for subtraction, not for addition of positive and negative numbers.

So, if I have two numbers, say, 109 and -42, and I want to add them using One's complement representation. How does that work?

In One's complement, to add a positive and a negative number, you first convert them into their respective One's complement forms and then add them as unsigned numbers, and then convert back to Two's complement if necessary.

Wait, no, maybe it's more involved. Let me recall: in One's complement, subtraction is performed by adding the One's complement of the number and the Two's complement of 1. But addition of two numbers in One's complement would just be adding their magnitude parts, similar to sign and magnitude, but with the sign determined by the number of negative operands.

Wait, actually, in One's complement, the sign is determined by the number of negative operands. So, adding a positive and a negative number would result in a negative number, regardless of the magnitude. So, perhaps it's similar to sign and magnitude.

But wait, in practice, in One's complement, the addition of two numbers is the same as the sum of their magnitude parts, without considering the sign. So, adding 109 (positive) and -42 (negative) would involve taking the magnitude of -42, which is 42, and adding it to 109, giving 151.

But in One's complement, since we have an 8-bit word, 151 is represented as 151 - 128 = 23, so 23 in binary is 00010111, so in One's complement, that would be 11101000. But wait, that's not the correct way. Actually, in Two's complement, 151 is beyond the 8-bit range, so it would wrap around to -23. Similarly, in One's complement, the overflow would result in the negative equivalent.

Wait, but in One's complement, how do you add numbers? Let me think. If you have an 8-bit One's complement number, adding two numbers would be similar to adding their magnitudes without considering the sign, and then handling overflows as negative results if the sum exceeds the maximum positive value.

So, 109 in One's complement is 01110011.

-42 in One's complement is the One's complement of 42, which is
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about integer addition in different number representations: one's complement, two's complement, and sign and magnitude. The question is asking in which of these representations the addition of 109 and -42 stays within range. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. I, II, and III. The correct answer is supposed to be C. I and II only, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what each of these representations means.

Starting with one's complement. I know that one's complement is a method used to represent negative numbers in binary. For an 8-bit word, each positive number is converted to its complement by inverting each bit. So, for example, the one's complement of 0 would be all 1s, which is 11111111 in binary. Similarly, the one's complement of a number is found by subtracting it from 11111111. However, one's complement alone isn't sufficient for signed arithmetic because when you add two numbers using one's complement, you have to deal with carries-out, which can complicate the result.

Two's complement is similar but improves upon one's complement by using the concept of signed digits. To get the two's complement of a number, you first take the one's complement and then add 1. This makes the number system balanced, meaning that the range of positive numbers equals the range of negative numbers, and zero is represented as 00000000. This is the method used in most computing systems to represent negative numbers, especially in 8-bit, 16-bit, etc., words.

Sign and magnitude. This is essentially the straightforward representation where the sign bit indicates the sign of the number, and the magnitude (the remaining bits) represent the absolute value of the number. This doesn't handle negative numbers in a balanced way like two's complement does. For example, the magnitude of a negative number would be represented as a positive number in the magnitude part, but when performing arithmetic, you have to separately handle the sign and the magnitude, which is less efficient.

Now, I need to think about how adding 109 and -42 is handled in each of these representations.

Let me consider each option: I, II, III.

First, 109 is a positive number, so in sign and magnitude, it's straightforward. -42 is negative, so in sign and magnitude, it's just the sign bit as negative, and the magnitude is 42.

Adding 109 and -42 should give 67, which is within the range if we're using 8-bit numbers because 8 bits can represent numbers from -128 to 127. So 67 is within that range.

Now, in one's complement, how does that addition work? Hmm.

In one's complement, a negative number is represented by its one's complement. So, to add 109 and -42, we need to convert both to one's complement 8-bit numbers.

First, let's find the one's complement of 109 and -42.

But wait, 109 is positive, so in one's complement, it's just the direct binary representation of 109, right? Wait, no. Actually, in one's complement, positive numbers are represented as their usual binary, and negative numbers are their one's complement.

So, for 8 bits:

First, represent 109 in binary. Let me compute that.

128 is 64 + 64, which is beyond 109. Let me compute 64 is 64, so 109 - 64 = 45.

45 is 32 + 13. So 32 is next, 45 - 32 = 13.

13 is 8 + 4 + 1. So 8 + 4 + 1 = 13.

So 109 in binary is 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 1, which is 01101101.

Wait, let me confirm:

64: 64

64 + 32 = 96

96 + 8 = 104

104 + 4 = 108

108 + 1 = 109

Yes, so 109 is 01101101 in 8 bits.

So, the one's complement of 109 would be 10010010, right? Because we invert each bit.

Similarly, for -42, we need the one's complement in 8 bits.

First, find the one's complement of 42.

42 in binary is 32 + 8 + 2, so 32 is 32, 32 + 8 is 40, 40 + 2 is 42.

So, 42 is 00101010 in 8 bits.

Thus, the one's complement of 42 is 11010101, and since we're in one's complement, that represents -42.

So, now, adding 109 and -42 in one's complement.

Which is, in 8 bits, adding 01101101 (109) and 11010101 (-42).

Let me perform this addition:

01101101

+11010101

------------

Let me add them bit by bit:

Starting from the right:

1 + 1 = 10, so write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 1, no carryover.

1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 0 + 1 = 1, no carryover.

1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

1 + 0 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

Now, since we have a carryover after the last bit, we need to add that as a new bit.

So, we have an overflow. So, the result is 10011110, but since we have an overflow, we discard the carryover, right? Wait, no, in one's complement, the overflow is handled differently.

Wait, in one's complement, when you add two numbers, if you get an overflow (carryout), you discard it because one's complement doesn't have a way to represent it. So, the sum is 10011110, but we have to discard the overflow, so it's 10011110.

But let's see what that number is. 10011110 in binary is 128 - 16 - 8 - 2 = 128 - 26 = 102? Wait, wait, let's calculate it properly.

10011110:

128 + 0 + 0 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0.

Wait, 128 is the first bit. Wait, no, 10011110 is:

From left to right: 1 (128), 0, 0, 1 (16), 1 (8), 1 (4), 1 (2), 0.

So, 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 128 + 30 = 158.

But since we are using 8 bits, 158 is outside the range because 8 bits can only go up to 127. So, in one's complement, does this cause an overflow?

Wait, but in one's complement, the addition is done within 8 bits, so when you have an overflow, it's discarded. So, the result is 158, but since 8 bits can only represent up to 127, the result wraps around.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If you add two 8-bit numbers and get a result that is 9 bits, do you wrap around? Or is it that one's complement doesn't handle overflow well?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of signed numbers. So, in one's complement, when you add two numbers, you can get a carry-out, but you just ignore it. So, the result is just the lower 8 bits of the sum.

So, 158 in 8 bits is 158 - 128 = 30. So, 30 is 00011110.

But wait, in one's complement, the sum is 10011110, which is 158, but since we only have 8 bits, it's considered as 30 (00011110). Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, adding 109 and -42 in one's complement:

109 is 01101101.

-42 is 11010101.

Adding them:

01101101

+11010101

=10011110, which is 158.

But in 8 bits, we have only 8 bits, so 158 is outside of the 8-bit range. So, in one's complement, adding those two numbers would give a number outside the range, hence not within the 8-bit word range.

Wait, but in two's complement, adding 109 and -42 gives the correct result within the range, right?

Wait, let me check two's complement.

First, let's get the two's complement of -42.

We can either take the one's complement of 42 and add 1, or subtract 42 from 128.

42 in 8 bits is 00101010.

So, one's complement is 11010101, then add 1 to get two's complement: 11010110.

So, -42 in two's complement is 11010110.

Now, let's add 109 and -42 in two's complement.

109 is 01101101.

-42 is 11010110.

Adding them:

01101101

+11010110

------------

Let me add each bit:

Right to left:

1 + 0 = 1.

0 + 1 = 1.

1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

1 + 0 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

0 + 1 + 1 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.

Now, we have a carryover after the last bit, so we add it as a new bit. So, the result is 10011101 with a carryover of 1. But in two's complement, we ignore the carryout, so the result is 10011101.

Wait, but let me verify: 10011101 is 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1? Wait:

64 (6th bit) + 16 (4th bit) + 8 (3rd bit) + 4 (2nd bit) + 1 (0th bit) = 64 + 16 = 80, 80 + 8 = 88, 88 + 4 = 92, 92 + 1 = 93.

Wait, that can't be right because 109 + (-42) is 67.

Wait, did I add wrong?

Wait, let me re-add:

First number: 01101101 (109)

Second number: 11010110 (-42)

Let me add them step by step:

Starting from the right:

1st bit (rightmost): 1 + 0 = 1

2nd bit: 0 + 1 = 1

3rd bit: 1 + 1 = 0 with carryover 1

4th bit: 0 + 1 + carryover 1 = 0 with carryover 1

5th bit: 1 + 0 + carryover 1 = 0 with carryover 1

6th bit: 1 + 1 + carryover 1 = 1 with carryover 1

7th bit: 0 + 0 + carryover 1 = 1 with carryover 1

8th bit: 0 + 1 + carryover 1 = 0 with carryover 1

Now, 9th bit: carryover 1.

So, the result is 10011101 with the 9th bit as 1, which is 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1? Wait, 128 + 16 is 144, plus 8 is 152, plus 4 is 156, plus 1 is 157. But we have only 8 bits, so we ignore the 9th bit, which is the overflow.

Wait, so in two's complement, the sum would be 10011101, but we ignore the overflow, so is it 10011101 or 10011101 with the overflow discarded?

Wait, in two's complement, when adding, the overflow is discarded, so 10011101 is the result, which is 67 in decimal.

Wait, let me confirm:

10011101 in binary is:

64 (128 is too big) so 64 is 64.

64 + 16 = 80

80 + 8 = 88

88 + 4 = 92

92 + 1 = 93. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 10011101.

Wait, binary digits: 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1.

So, from left to right:

1: 128

0: 64

0: 32

1: 16

1: 8

1: 4

0: 2

1: 1

So, adding 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 128 + 29 = 157. But since it's an 8-bit number, we can't have 157 because the maximum is 127. So, we need to interpret this as a signed two's complement number.

Wait, in two's complement, the number is interpreted as negative if the sign bit is 1. So, 10011101 has a sign bit of 1, so it's a negative number.

Wait, but 109 + (-42) should be 67, which is positive. So, perhaps my addition was wrong.

Wait, 109 in two's complement is 01101101, since it's positive.

-42 in two's complement is 11010110.

So, adding 01101101 + 11010110:

Let me do it in decimal:

109 + (-42) = 67.

But what do we get in two's complement?

Wait, 10011101 is 67 in two's complement? Wait, no.

Wait, in two's complement, 10011101 is actually 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 157, but since it's an 8-bit number, 157 - 128 = 29? Wait, no.

Wait, no, in two's complement, each number is represented as signed. So, 10011101 is (-1)*128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = -128 + 29 = -99. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 109 + (-42) is 67.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check the addition.

Wait, 01101101 is 109. 11010110 is -42.

If I convert both to decimal:

109 is 109.

-42 is -42.

109 + (-42) = 67.

But when adding their two's complement representations, we should get 67 in two's complement.

Wait, 67 in two's complement is 00100011.

Wait, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, 67 in decimal is 64 + 2 + 1, which is 00100011 in 8 bits.

But earlier, when I added 109 and -42, I got 10011101, which is 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 157.

Wait, but 157 in two's complement is interpreted as 157 - 128 = 29? No, that's only if we're subtracting, right? Wait, no.

Wait, in two's complement, if the number is above 127, it's considered negative. So, 128 is -128, 129 is -127, etc.

So, 157 is 157 - 128 = 29 above 128, so it's equivalent to -71.

Wait, that's not 67.

So, that's a problem. That would mean that adding 109 and -42 in two's complement gives -71, which is incorrect because 109 - 42 is 67.

Wait, so maybe I messed up the addition.

Wait, let me do this step by step.

Adding 01101101 (109) and 11010110 (-42).

Starting from the right:

Bit 0: 1 + 0 = 1.

Bit 1: 0 + 1 = 1.

Bit 2: 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.

Bit 3: 0 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 0, carryover 1.

Bit 4: 1 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 0, carryover 1.

Bit 5: 1 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 1, carryover 1.

Bit 6: 0 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 1, carryover 1.

Bit 7: 0 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 0, carryover 1.

Now, all bits are processed, but there's a carryover beyond bit 7, which is the sign bit.

So, in two's complement, we add that carryover as a new bit, making the result 10011101 with an overflow. However, since we're using 8 bits, we ignore the overflow.

Wait, so is the result 10011101 or is it considered as 10011101 with the overflow, meaning we interpret it as 10011101 in two's complement.

But 10011101 is 128 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 157. So, in two's complement, that would be -71, as 157 - 128 = 29, but wait, 157 - 128 is 29, which is positive, so why is it negative?

Wait, no, in two's complement, the value is computed as follows: for an 8-bit number, the value is V = N - 128, where N is the integer value of the binary number.

So, for 10011101, N is 128 +
