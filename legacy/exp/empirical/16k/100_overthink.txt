[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of an observable yields 0 at a certain time t. The system's state is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by a matrix operator P, which has specific elements in its rows. 

First, I should recall what an observable is in quantum mechanics. From what I remember, an observable corresponds to a Hermitian operator, which means it has real eigenvalues and is equal to its own conjugate transpose. The measurement of an observable yields one of its eigenvalues, each with a corresponding probability depending on the state of the system.

Given that, the problem gives me the state vector |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] and the observable operator P. The first thing I should do is find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible outcomes when measuring the observable. The probabilities will then be the squared magnitudes of the projections of |ψ> onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

So, let's write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, P is a symmetric matrix because if I look at the elements, P12 = P21 = 1/√2, P13 = P31 = 0, and P23 = P32 = 1/√2. Since P is symmetric, it's Hermitian, which aligns with what I know.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set that up.

P - λI is:

[ -λ   1/√2   0 ]
[1/√2  -λ    1/√2]
[ 0    1/√2  -λ ]

Now, computing the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |
| d e f |
| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

Applying that to our matrix:

First, the (1,1) element is -λ, and the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ] because (1/√2)(1/√2) = 1/2.

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/2

Third term is 0, so we can ignore it.

Putting it together:

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ / 2.

Simplify:

det = -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So, det(P - λI) = -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor:

-λ(λ² - 1) = 0 => λ(-λ - 1)(λ - 1) = 0.

So, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Wait, let's double-check that factorization.

Wait, -λ³ + λ = 0 => factor out λ: λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(-1)(λ² - 1) = 0 => So, eigenvalues λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Yes, that's correct. So the possible outcomes are -1, 0, and 1.

But the question is asking for the probability of measuring 0. So, I need the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the projection of the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector, take its norm squared, and that will be the probability.

So, first, let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0*I)|v> = 0 => P|v> = 0.

So, let me write down the system of equations:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as row 1, which gives v2=0.

So, from rows 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1; 0; -1]. Let me verify that.

Let me plug into P:

P * [1; 0; -1]^T = [0*(1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1); (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1); 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1)].

Compute component-wise:

First component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0.

Third component: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So, yes, P * |v> = 0 as expected. So, the eigenvector is [1; 0; -1].

So, now, the projection of |ψ> onto |v> is given by (|ψ> ⋅ |v>)/(|v|²) * |v>.

First, compute |ψ> ⋅ |v>:

|ψ> = [-1; 2; 1], |v> = [1; 0; -1].

Dot product: (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Compute |v|²: [1]^2 + [0]^2 + [-1]^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So, the projection is (-2)/2 * |v> = (-1) * |v> = [-1; 0; 1].

But the projection is a vector. However, the probability is the squared norm of this projection.

Compute ||projection||²: (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Wait, that can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, wait. No, the projection is (|ψ> ⋅ |v>)/(|v|²) * |v>. So, the scalar factor is (-2)/2 = -1, so the projection is (-1)|v> = [-1; 0; 1]. The norm squared is 1^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2. So, the probability is 2.

But that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, clearly, I must have messed up something.

Wait, wait, hold on. Maybe the error is in the calculation of the projection.

Wait, no, the projection operator is (|v><v|)/(|v|²). So, the projection of |ψ> is (|v><v|) |ψ> = (|v><v| ψ>), which is ( (ψ ⋅ v) / |v|² ) |v>.

But in this case, ψ ⋅ v is -2, |v|² is 2, so the scalar is -1, so the projection is -|v>, which is [-1; 0; 1]. Then the norm squared is 2, which is indeed the probability. But that's over 1, so that can't be.

Wait, but I thought the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projection. So, is it |projection|²? But in this case, projection is a vector, so ||proj||² is indeed the probability.

But in this case, ||proj||² is 2, which is greater than 1. But probabilities cannot exceed 1, so this suggests something is wrong.

Wait, let me check my steps again.

First, the eigenvalue λ=0, correct.

Then, the eigenvectors satisfy P|v> = 0. Calculated as [1; 0; -1], correct.

Then, the projection of |ψ> onto |v> is (|ψ ⋅ v> / |v|²) |v> = (-2 / 2) |v> = -|v> = [-1; 0; 1].

Wait, but |v> is an eigenvector, so the projection is a vector, but the probability is the squared norm of the projection vector, which in this case is ||proj||² = || -|v> ||² = || |v> ||² = 2. Hmm.

But that's a problem because probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the inner product.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again: ψ ⋅ v.

ψ is [-1; 2; 1], v is [1; 0; -1].

Dot product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. That seems correct.

|v|² is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Correct.

Projection is (-2)/2 |v> = -|v>. So, projection vector is [-1; 0; 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + (1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is that the observable operator is not normalized? Do observables need to be projectors or can they have trace not equal to 1?

Wait, no. In quantum mechanics, the operator corresponding to an observable is supposed to be Hermitian, which P is, but not necessarily a projection operator. However, the measurement operator is a projection operator onto the eigenspace of the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, perhaps the operator P is not a projection operator itself, but when you make a measurement, you project onto the eigenspace.

Wait, let me clarify. The observable is represented by a Hermitian operator P. The measurement corresponds to projecting the state onto the eigenspace of P and then measuring the eigenvalue.

But in this case, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by |v> = [1; 0; -1]. So, the projection operator is |v><v|.

Wait, but in that case, the projection operator is |v><v|, which is a rank 1 projectors.

Therefore, the projection of |ψ> is |v><v|ψ>, which is equal to (ψ ⋅ v) |v>.

But |v> is [1; 0; -1], so |v> is normalized? Wait, |v> has norm sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So, to get a unit vector, we have to normalize |v>.

Wait, that might be the mistake here. Because eigenstates are not necessarily normalized. So, if |v> is an eigenvector, we should normalize it before using it in the projection.

So, let's normalize |v> first.

Compute |v> = [1; 0; -1], norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2)) |v>.

Therefore, the projection operator is (|v><v|)/2.

So, the projection of |ψ> is (|v><v|)/2 |ψ> = (1/2) (ψ ⋅ v) |v>.

Compute ψ ⋅ v: -2 as before.

So, the projection is (-2)/2 |v> = -|v> = [-1; 0; 1].

But this is the same as before, but in this case, |v> was normalized.

Wait, but if |v> is normalized, then the projection operator is (|v><v|), but we have to make sure.

Wait, no, if |v> is normalized, then the projection operator is |v><v|, so the projection of ψ is (ψ ⋅ v) |v>.

But ψ ⋅ v is -2, and |v> is [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

So, the projection is (-2) * [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2) = [-2/sqrt(2); 0; 2/sqrt(2)] = [-sqrt(2); 0; sqrt(2)].

Wait, hold on. Let me do this step by step.

If the projection operator is |v><v| / (|v|²) or just |v><v|, depending on whether |v> is normalized.

Since in the projection, we have:

proj_v |ψ> = (|v><v|) |ψ> = (|v> (v ⋅ ψ)).

But since |v> is not normalized, we have to normalize it.

Alternatively, the projection operator is (|v><v|)/|v|², so proj_v |ψ> = (|v><v| / |v|²) |ψ> = ( (v ⋅ ψ)/|v|² ) |v> = (ψ ⋅ v / |v|²) |v>.

Which in this case is ( (-2)/2 ) |v> = -|v> = [-1; 0; 1].

But that vector has norm sqrt(1^2 + 0 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So, the probability is ||proj_v |ψ>||² = (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Again, same result. So, is this possible?

But in quantum mechanics, probabilities can't exceed 1, so I must have messed something up.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the operator P is not a projection operator, but in reality, when you perform a measurement, you're projecting onto the eigenspace of the eigenvalue you're interested in.

But P itself is the observable, so the measurement operator is |e><e|, where |e> is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue λ.

But in this case, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, so the measurement operator is |v><v|, where v is [1; 0; -1]. Therefore, the projection is |v><v|ψ>, which is (ψ ⋅ v) |v>.

But ψ ⋅ v = -2, and |v> is [1; 0; -1]. So, ψ ⋅ v = -2, so proj = (-2) |v> = [-2; 0; 2]. The norm of this projection is sqrt( (-2)^2 + 0 + 2^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). The probability is then ||proj||² = (2*sqrt(2))² = 8. Wait, that can't be either.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait: projection is (ψ ⋅ v) |v>, but |v> is not normalized here. So, if |v> is not normalized, the projection operator is |v><v|.

But the projection vector is (ψ ⋅ v) |v> = -2 |v> = [-2; 0; 2]. The norm is sqrt(4 + 0 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). Therefore, the probability is ||proj||² = (2*sqrt(2))² = 8. That's way over 1.

I must be doing something wrong here.

Wait, but maybe my confusion is arising from the fact that P is not a unitary operator or a projection operator. So, when we talk about the observable, P is a Hermitian matrix, but when we measure it, we don't just apply P, but we measure the eigenvalues. So, the measurement operator is a projection onto the eigenspace.

But for λ=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as we found, with eigenvector [1; 0; -1]. So, the projection operator is |e><e|, where |e> is the normalized eigenvector.

So, first, let's normalize |v> = [1; 0; -1]. The norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is |e> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

Therefore, the projection operator is |e><e|.

So, the projection of |ψ> is <e|ψ>.

Compute <e|ψ>:

e is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)] and ψ is [-1; 2; 1].

Dot product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Therefore, the projection is -sqrt(2) |e>. The norm squared is | -sqrt(2) |² * ||e||² = (2) * (1) = 2.

Wait, that's still 2. But that can't be because probability can't be more than 1.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the projection is a vector, but the projection vector is already scalar multiplied by |e>.

But the norm of the projection vector is |sqrt(2)|, because the projection vector is -sqrt(2)|e>, so ||projection|| = sqrt(2) * ||e|| = sqrt(2)*1 = sqrt(2). So, the probability is ||projection||² = (sqrt(2))² = 2. Hmm.

Still 2. That can't be, right? So, perhaps I have a conceptual misunderstanding here.

Wait, the problem is that the observable is being represented by operator P, but in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, but the measurement process involves projecting the state onto the eigenspace of the eigenvalue you are measuring.

However, the question is: is P itself the measurement operator, or is it just the observable, and the actual measurement operator is a projection onto the eigenspace?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the observable P has eigenvalues which are the possible measurement outcomes, and the corresponding measurement operator is the projection onto the eigenspace.

But in this case, if P is not normalized, does that affect the probabilities?

Wait, no, the measurement operator is always a projection onto the eigenspace, regardless of the operator P.

So, for the eigenvalue λ=0, the measurement operator is |e><e|, where |e> is normalized. So, the projection of |ψ> is <e|ψ>, and the probability is |<e|ψ>|².

So, let's compute |<e|ψ>|²:

Compute <e|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))² = 2. So, the probability is 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, clearly, I'm messing something up.

Wait, maybe my confusion is arising because I thought |e> is the eigenvector, which is [1; 0; -1], but when normalized, it's [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)], correct.

Then the inner product is indeed (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). Squaring that gives 2.

Wait, but that can't be. Hmm.

But the state |ψ> is given as a column matrix (-1; 2; 1). So, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the eigenvectors are [1; 0; -1], but perhaps it's not normalized?

Wait, when we found the eigenvector, we didn't normalize it, and perhaps for probabilities, normalization is required.

Wait, so the projection is (|v><v|ψ>), where |v> is the eigenvector. Since |v> is not normalized, the projection is (|v><v|ψ>), whose norm squared is (|v><v|ψ>)† (|v><v|ψ>) = |v|² |<v|ψ>|².

Therefore, the probability is |<v|ψ>|².

So, here, |v> is [1; 0; -1]. So, <v|ψ> = (-1)*1 + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -2.

Therefore, |<v|ψ>|² = | -2 |² = 4.

But wait, the probability is 4? That's even worse.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the normalized eigenvector for the projection.

So, with the normalized |e>, the projection is |e><e|ψ>, and |e><e|ψ> is a scalar, whose absolute value squared is the probability.

So, |<e|ψ>|² = | (-sqrt(2) ) |² = 2.

So, regardless, whether normalized or not, I'm getting probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible.

So, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, let me reread the problem.

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.

Why the correct answer is: sqrt(2/3)"

Wait, so the correct probability is sqrt(2/3). That suggests the probability is not 2 or 1/2, but sqrt(2/3). So, I must have messed up.

Wait, let me try another approach.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the sum over the projections onto each eigenvector.

Wait, but in this case, for λ=0, the eigenvector is unique up to scaling. So, if I compute the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector and then take the squared norm, it's supposed to give the probability.

But as above, when I compute the projection, I get a vector whose norm squared is 2, which can't be.

Wait, but perhaps the observable operator P is not normalized? Because in quantum mechanics, the observable should be traceless? No, Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, but they don't have to be traceless.

Wait, but maybe P is not normalized. Wait, the trace of P is the sum of its eigenvalues.

Compute trace of P: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So, it's traceless. So, it's possible, but that doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the trace and probabilities. The sum of probabilities for all possible eigenvalues should equal 1.

We have eigenvalues -1, 0, and 1.

So, the sum of the probabilities for these eigenvalues should be 1.

So, if I compute the probability for λ=0, and then compute probabilities for λ=1 and λ=-1, they should add up to 1.

So, let me try computing probability for λ=1.

First, find eigenvector for λ=1.

We have P - I = [ -1   1/√2   0 ]
              [1/√2  -1    1/√2]
              [ 0    1/√2  -1 ]

Compute determinant: but we know the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0. So, let's find the eigenvector for λ=1.

Solve (P - I)|v> = 0.

Row 1: -1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)*v1 - v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0.

Row 3: (1/√2)*v2 - v3 = 0.

Let me write these equations:

1) -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0.

2) (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0.

3) (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0.

From equation 1: v1 = (1/√2)v2.

From equation 3: v3 = (1/√2)v2.

So, let me substitute into equation 2.

(1/√2)*( (1/√2)v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2)*( (1/√2)v2 ) = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)*(1/√2)v2 = (1/2)v2.

Then, -v2.

Then, (1/√2)*(1/√2)v2 = (1/2)v2.

So, total:

(1/2)v2 - v2 + (1/2)v2 = (1/2 - 1 + 1/2)v2 = 0.

So, equation 2 is satisfied for any v2. So, we can choose v2 = √2 to have integer components.

So, let's set v2 = √2.

Then, v1 = (1/√2)*√2 = 1.

v3 = (1/√2)*√2 = 1.

So, the eigenvector is [1; √2; 1].

Check if P|v> = |v>:

Compute P * |v>:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*√2 + 0*1 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*√2 + (1/√2)*1 = (1/√2 + 1/√2) = 1.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*√2 + 0*1 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

So, P|v> = [1; 1; 1] which is not equal to |v> = [1; √2; 1]. Wait, that doesn't match. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's do it step by step.

Compute each component:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*√2 + 0*1. (1/√2)*√2 is 1, so total 1. Correct.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*√2 + (1/√2)*1 = 1/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*√2 + 0*1 = 1.

Wait, so P|v> = [1; sqrt(2); 1]. Which is equal to |v> because |v> is [1; sqrt(2); 1]. So, correct. So, the eigenvector for λ=1 is [1; sqrt(2); 1].

Similarly, for λ=-1, the eigenvector will be something else.

But okay, for now, let's try to compute the probability for λ=1.

First, normalize the eigenvector |v> = [1; sqrt(2); 1].

Compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2.

So, normalized eigenvector is [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2].

Compute the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector.

|ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

Dot product with normalized |e>:

(-1)(1/2) + 2*(sqrt(2)/2) + 1*(1/2) = (-1/2) + (2*sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2) = (-1/2 + 1/2) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Therefore, the projection is sqrt(2) |e>, and the probability is |sqrt(2)|² = 2.

Again, probability is 2, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the observable not as the operator P, but as some projection? Wait, but P is given as the operator. So, perhaps it's not the measurement operator but the operator itself.

Wait, no, the observable is represented by operator P, which is Hermitian, so the measurement operator is the projection onto the eigenstates of P.

Wait, but the probabilities are |<e|ψ>|², where |e> is the normalized eigenvector.

But in our case, |<e|ψ>|² is (sqrt(2))²=2, which is greater than 1.

Wait, so perhaps the issue is that the observable P is not normalized? Because if the trace is 0, which is the case here, since eigenvalues are -1, 0, 1, so trace is 0, then it's traceless.

But in quantum mechanics, the trace of the observable operator is the sum of probabilities multiplied by eigenvalues. So, if the trace is 0, that would mean the average measurement is 0.

But the trace being 0 doesn't directly help with probabilities.

Wait, but if I compute the sum of the probabilities for each eigenvalue, they must add up to 1.

But in our case, we have eigenvalues -1, 0, 1.

So, the sum of the probabilities for -1, 0, 1 is 1.

But if the probability for 0 is 2, as we had, and the probabilities for 1 and -1 would have to add up to -1. Which is impossible because probabilities can't be negative.

So, this must indicate an error in my calculations.

Wait, let's try computing the probability for λ=1 again.

Eigenvector is [1; sqrt(2); 1], normalized to [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2].

Compute the inner product with |ψ>:

(-1)(1/2) + 2*(sqrt(2)/2) + 1*(1/2) = (-1/2) + sqrt(2) + 1/2 = (-1/2 + 1/2) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So, the probability is |sqrt(2)|² = 2.

Similarly, for λ=-1, let's compute the eigenvector.

Solve (P - (-1)I)|v> = 0 => P + I = [1   1/√2   0]
                              [1/√2 1    1/√2]
                              [0    1/√2 1]

Compute determinant of P + I:

Row 1: 1, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 1, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 1

Compute determinant:

1*(1*1 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)*1 - (1/√2)*0 ) + 0*(...).

Compute term by term.

First term: 1*(1 - (1/2)) = 1*(1/2) = 1/2.

Second term: -(1/√2)*(1/√2 - 0) = -(1/√2)*(1/√2) = -1/2.

Third term: 0.

Total determinant: 1/2 - 1/2 + 0 = 0.

So, the eigenvalue λ=-1 is present.

Find eigenvectors.

Solve P + I |v> = 0.

So,

1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 = 0.

(1/√2)*v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0.

(1/√2)*v2 + 1*v3 = 0.

Let me write equations:

1) v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0.

2) (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0.

3) (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0.

From equation 1: v1 = - (1/√2) v2.

From equation 3: v3 = - (1/√2)v2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

v2.

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

So, total:

(-1/2)v2 + v2 - (1/2)v2 = (-1/2 + 1 - 1/2)v2 = (0)v2 = 0.

So, equation 2 is satisfied for any v2. So, choose v2 = sqrt(2) to have integer components.

So, v2 = sqrt(2), then v1 = - (1/√2)*sqrt(2) = -1.

v3 = - (1/√2)*sqrt(2) = -1.

So, eigenvector is [-1; sqrt(2); -1].

Check P|v> + I|v> = 0.

Compute P|v>:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(sqrt(2)) + (1/√2)*(-1) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = -sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Then, P|v> + I|v> = [1 + (-1); -sqrt(2) + (-1); 1 + (-1)] = [0; -sqrt(2) -1; 0].

Wait, but that is not zero. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check P|v>:

|v> = [-1; sqrt(2); -1].

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(sqrt(2)) + (1/√2)*(-1) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = -sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

So, P|v> = [1; -sqrt(2); 1].

Then, P + I |v> = (P|v> ) + I|v> = [1 + (-1); -sqrt(2) + 0; 1 + (-1)] = [0; -sqrt(2); 0]. Which is not zero. So, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is not correct.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach.

Given P + I |v> = 0.

Let me denote |v> = [v1; v2; v3].

Equation 1: v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0.

Equation 2: (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0.

Equation 3: (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0.

From equation 1: v1 = - (1/√2) v2.

From equation 3: v3 = - (1/√2) v2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

v2.

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

So, equation 2 becomes:

(-1/2)v2 + v2 - (1/2)v2 = (-1/2 + 1 - 1/2)v2 = 0*v2 = 0.

So, equation is satisfied for any v2.

Therefore, choose v2 = sqrt(2), so v1 = -1, v3 = -1.

So, |v> = [-1; sqrt(2); -1].

But earlier, P|v> + I|v> = [0; -sqrt(2); 0], which is not zero. So, that can't be.

Wait, is there a mistake in computing P|v>?

Wait, let me compute P|v> component-wise.

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(sqrt(2)) + (1/√2)*(-1) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = -sqrt(2).

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*(sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, P|v> = [1; -sqrt(2); 1].

Therefore, P|v> + I|v> = [1 + (-1); -sqrt(2) + 0; 1 + (-1)] = [0; -sqrt(2); 0], which is not zero. So, that suggests that my eigenvector is not correct. But according to the equations, it should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Because P + I is the matrix, and |v> is supposed to satisfy (P + I)|v> = 0. However, when I plug in |v>, I don't get zero. So, perhaps my eigenvector is not correct.

Wait, let's try a different approach: assume |v> = [v1; v2; v3], and plug into P|v> + I|v> = 0.

Compute each component:

First component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 + 1*v1 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 + 1*v2 = 0.

Third component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 + 1*v3 = 0.

So, equations:

1) (1)v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0.

2) (1/√2)v1 + (1)v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0.

3) (1/√2)v2 + (1)v3 = 0.

So, same as before, but equations are slightly different.

From equation 1: v1 = - (1/√2) v2.

From equation 3: v3 = - (1/√2) v2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = 0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

v2.

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = (-1/2)v2.

So, equation 2: (-1/2)v2 + v2 - (1/2)v2 = 0.

Thus, 0=0.

So, the system is consistent, but eigenvectors are same as before.

Wait, but when I plug |v> into (P + I)|v>, it's not zero.

Wait, maybe I made a computational mistake.

Compute (P + I)|v>:

|v> = [-1; sqrt(2); -1].

Compute (P + I)|v>:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 1*(-1) = 0 + 1 -1 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*(sqrt(2)) + (1/√2)*(-1) + 1*(sqrt(2)) = (-1/√2 -1/√2) + sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2)) + sqrt(2) = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)(sqrt(2)) + 1*(-1) = 0 + 1 -1 = 0.

Ah! So, (P + I)|v> is [0; 0; 0]. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought P|v> + I|v> was not zero. So, that is correct.

Therefore, |v> = [-1; sqrt(2); -1] is indeed the eigenvector for λ=-1.

So, the eigenvectors are:

λ=1: [1; sqrt(2); 1], normalized to [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2].

λ=0: [1; 0; -1], normalized to [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

λ=-1: [-1; sqrt(2); -1], normalized to [-1/sqrt(2); sqrt(2)/sqrt(2); -1/sqrt(2)] = [-1/sqrt(2); 1; -1/sqrt(2)].

Wait, let's compute that.

For λ=-1, |v> = [-1; sqrt(2); -1], norm is sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4)=2. So, normalized, it is [ -1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2 ].

So, normalized eigenvectors:

λ=1: [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2].

λ=0: [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

λ=-1: [ -1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2 ].

Wait, now, let's compute the projection of |ψ> onto each eigenvector.

First, |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

Projection onto λ=1 eigenvector:

Dot product with [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2]:

(-1)(1/2) + 2*(sqrt(2)/2) + 1*(1/2) = (-1/2) + sqrt(2) + 1/2 = sqrt(2).

Multiply by the normalized eigenvector:

sqrt(2) * [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2] = [ sqrt(2)/2; 1; sqrt(2)/2 ].

Norm squared: (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + 1^2 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) = 2.

Probability: 2.

Same as before.

Projection onto λ=0 eigenvector:

Dot product with [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)]:

(-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Multiply by the normalized eigenvector:

-sqrt(2) * [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)] = [-1; 0; 1].

Norm squared: (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2.

Probability: 2.

Same issue.

Projection onto λ=-1 eigenvector:

Dot product with [ -1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2 ]:

(-1)*(-1/2) + 2*(sqrt(2)/2) + 1*(-1/2) = (1/2) + sqrt(2) - 1/2 = sqrt(2).

Multiply by the normalized eigenvector:

sqrt(2)*[ -1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2 ] = [ -sqrt(2)/2; 1; -sqrt(2)/2 ].

Norm squared: (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + 1 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (0.5 + 1 + 0.5) = 2.

Probability: 2.

Wait, so all probabilities are 2, which is wrong.

But hold on, this suggests that the probabilities are just twice the norm squared, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is being confused with the projection operator.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it just says that P is the matrix operator, and we're to compute the probability that the measurement yields 0.

In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by P, and the probability is the expectation value <ψ| P^2 |ψ> divided by <ψ| P |ψ>, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, no. The probability is the expectation value <ψ| P |ψ>, but only when P is a projection operator.

Wait, no, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² where |v> is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue λ.

But as we saw, this is giving 2, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the problem is that P is not a normalized operator, so when we calculate probabilities, they don't sum to 1.

Wait, let's compute the trace of P^2.

P is symmetric, so P^2 is trace equal to the sum of squares of its eigenvalues.

Eigenvalues are -1, 0, 1.

Sum of squares: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So, trace of P^2 is 2.

But in quantum mechanics, the trace of P^2 is equal to the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the squares of the eigenvalues.

Wait, but sum of the probabilities multiplied by squares of eigenvalues is sum_{λ} |c_λ|² λ^2, where c_λ are the coefficients from spectral decomposition.

But in reality, the probabilities are |c_λ|², and the trace of P is sum λ |c_λ|².

But in our case, the trace of P is 0, which is sum λ |c_λ|² = 0.

But the trace of P^2 is 2, which is sum λ² |c_λ|².

But from our calculations, each probability is 2, which is impossible.

Wait, but if the probabilities are |c_λ|², and sum λ |c_λ|² = 0, sum λ² |c_λ|² = 2, and sum |c_λ|² = 1.

But with our current results, sum |c_λ|² = 3*2=6, which is not 1. So, clearly, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the observable P is not the operator, but the square of the operator. Because in the problem statement, it just says P is the matrix operator, not that it's the projection operator.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to P squared.

Wait, but the problem says "the observable will yield 0", so that would correspond to the projection onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

But P is not diagonal, so it's not obvious.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the operator is P, but the measurement is P squared or something else.

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, measuring an observable corresponds to projecting onto its eigenspaces.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is being used as a measurement operator, not as the observable itself. Maybe the problem is mistyped.

Wait, perhaps, if we consider that the operator P is the projection operator for the observable, then P would be rank 1, but P is given as a 3x3 matrix with some non-zero elements, which is not rank 1.

Wait, looking again:

P is

[0, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 0, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 0]

So, it's a symmetric matrix, and in fact, it's a symmetric matrix with 0 on the diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal.

So, it's a kind of a "exchange" matrix between the second and first, third elements.

Wait, perhaps P is the adjacency matrix for a graph or something.

But in any case, P is a Hermitian operator, so it's an observable.

But in that case, when we perform a measurement, we would need to project the state onto the eigenspace of P, which in this case, is the same as projecting onto the eigenstates with eigenvalue 0.

But as we've computed, the projection is leading to a norm squared of 2, which is impossible.

Wait, but the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, sqrt(2/3)^2 is 2/3, which is less than 1.

So, perhaps the correct probability is 2/3. So, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the projection is |v><v|ψ>, but actually, the probability is |proj|², where proj is (|v><v|ψ)/|v|².

Wait, let's try that.

So, projection of |ψ> onto |v> is ( <v|ψ> / |v|² ) |v> = ( (-2) / 2 ) |v> = -|v> = [-1; 0; 1].

Then, the norm squared of this projection vector is 2, but perhaps the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / |v|², so |(-2)|² / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2. Still, same result.

Alternatively, if the state |v> is not normalized, perhaps the inner product is scaled.

Wait, maybe the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / |v|², but that is 4 / 2 = 2.

Alternatively, if I use the normalized |v>, the inner product is -sqrt(2), so |inner product|² = 2, which is again the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not correctly considering that the observable is P, and the probabilities are given by the spectral decomposition.

So, in that case, the observable can be written as P = sum λ |e_λ><e_λ|, where |e_λ> are the eigenvectors.

Then, the expectation value of P is <ψ| P |ψ> = sum λ |<e_λ|ψ>|².

But in our case, the expectation value is sum λ |c_λ|², where c_λ are the coefficients.

But the problem is not asking about the expectation value, but the probability of a specific eigenvalue.

So, for λ=0, the probability is |<e_0|ψ>|².

But as we saw, this is 2.

But since probabilities can't exceed 1, perhaps the problem is that the observable is not normalized.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, which can be unbounded. So, for example, position and momentum operators are unbounded.

But when you measure it, the probabilities are still between 0 and 1.

Wait, but in our case, the probability is |<e|ψ>|², which can exceed 1 if |e> is not normalized.

But e is supposed to be normalized.

Wait, the issue is that in this problem, |e> is not normalized. So, if |e> is not normalized, then the projection is (|e><e|)ψ, whose norm squared is |<e|ψ>|², which can be greater than 1.

But in reality, the projection operator is (|e><e|)/|e|², so the projection of ψ is (|e><e|ψ)/|e|² = (|e> (e ⋅ ψ)) / |e|².

Therefore, the projection is a scalar times |e>, and the norm squared is |e ⋅ ψ|² / |e|².

So, in our case, |e> is [1; 0; -1] normalized.

Compute |e ⋅ ψ|² / |e|² = |<e|ψ>|² = | (-sqrt(2)) |² = 2.

But 2 is greater than 1, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only way this makes sense is that the eigenvectors are not correct.

But we computed the eigenvectors correctly. So, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the observable is represented not by P, but by P squared.

Compute P squared:

P^2 = P * P.

Compute each component.

First row:

(0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0, 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2), 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0.

Wait, no, better to compute P^2 step by step.

First row of P:

[0, 1/√2, 0].

Multiply by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2.

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2 + 0 = 1/2.

Second row of P:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2].

Multiply by P:

First element: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Second element: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 = 1/2 + 0 + 0 = 1/2.

Third element: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Third row of P:

[0, 1/√2, 0].

Multiply by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

So, P^2 is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2;

0, 1/2, 0;

1/2, 0, 1/2]

So, P squared is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

So, eigenvalues of P squared are 1/2, 1/2, 1/2.

Wait, but in that case, the trace is 3*(1/2) = 3/2.

Which is different from before.

But in any case, the eigenvalues of P squared are all 1/2.

So, if the observable is P squared, then the eigenvalues are 1/2, so the measurement outcomes are 1/2, and the probability is |<e|ψ>|².

But in that case, the probabilities would add up to 1.

Compute projection onto P squared's eigenvector.

Wait, P squared is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal, so the eigenvectors are standard basis vectors.

So, for the first component, eigenvector is [1; 0; 0], second [0;1;0], third [0;0;1].

Compute the projection of |ψ> onto [1;0;0]: inner product is -1, squared is 1.

Similarly for others: 4 and 1.

So, probabilities would be 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, which sum to 3/2. That's not 1.

Wait, but if the eigenvalues of P squared are 1/2, then the observable is P squared, which is 1/2 times the identity matrix. But that can't be because P squared is not equal to 1/2 I.

Wait, no, P squared is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal, so it's (1/2) I.

So, P squared is (1/2) I, which has eigenvalues 1/2, and eigenvectors the standard basis vectors.

But then, the observable being P squared, which is a positive semi-definite operator, with eigenvalues 1/2, so the measurement outcomes are 1/2, and the probabilities are the squared projections.

But in that case, the probabilities would be ||proj_v |ψ>||², where |v> is each standard basis vector.

Compute projection onto [1;0;0]: inner product is -1, squared is 1. So, probability 1.

Similarly, projection onto [0;1;0]: inner product is 2, squared is 4, but probability is 4/ (norm squared of [0;1;0])= 4/1=4. Not possible.

Wait, no, projection onto [0;1;0] is ( <[0;1;0] |ψ> ) [0;1;0] = (2) [0;1;0].

Norm squared is 4, which is impossible. So, that can't be.

Therefore, thinking in terms of P squared might not be the correct path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think: in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes, and the probabilities are |<e|ψ>|², where |e> is the normalized eigenvector.

But in our case, the probabilities are 2, which is wrong. So, perhaps the issue is that the operator P is not supposed to be used as the observable, but instead, the observable is another operator.

But the problem says "An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P...", so P is the observable.

Therefore, perhaps the issue is that in the problem statement, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is a column vector.

But in quantum mechanics, state vectors are column vectors, and the probabilities are calculated as the squared norms of the projections.

But since the projection is giving a norm squared of 2, which is more than 1, perhaps the problem is in how the observable is defined.

Wait, perhaps the operator P is not supposed to be the observable itself, but the projection operator onto the eigenspace. So, if P is the projection operator, then P^2 = P.

But in our case, P squared is not equal to P. Earlier, we found that P squared is (1/2) I.

So, if P squared is (1/2) I, then P is a projection operator scaled by sqrt(1/2). So, if P is a projection operator, it should satisfy P^2 = P.

But in our case, P squared is (1/2) I, which is not equal to P.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stating that P is the observable operator, when in fact, it is the projection operator.

Wait, but if P is the projection operator, then the observable would be something else.

Wait, confusion arises.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is supposed to be (I + something), but not sure.

Wait, but since the correct answer is sqrt(2/3), which is approx 0.816, let's try computing the projection again, maybe my normalization is wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the projection using the normalized eigenvector.

So, |e> for λ=0 is [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

Compute |ψ ⋅ |e>:

(-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So, the projection is -sqrt(2) |e>.

But in quantum mechanics, the projection operator is (|e><e|), so the projection of |ψ> is (|e><e|) |ψ> = |e> (e ⋅ ψ).

Which is |e> (-sqrt(2)).

Therefore, the projection is a vector, whose norm squared is |e> norm squared times | -sqrt(2) | squared.

Since |e> is normalized, the norm squared is 1, so the probability is | -sqrt(2) | squared = 2.

Again, same result. So, this suggests that the probability is 2, but the answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3).

This is a contradiction, unless the observable is not P but something else.

Wait, perhaps the operator given is P = |e0><e0| + |e1><e1| + |e2><e2|, but not sure.

Wait, looking at the given P, it's a symmetric matrix, which, as computed, has eigenvalues -1, 0, 1.

Wait, let's try computing the expectation value of P in |ψ>.

Compute <ψ| P |ψ>.

Which is:

First component of P|ψ>:

0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 0 + sqrt(2) + 0 = sqrt(2).

Second component:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2 + 1/√2) = 0.

Third component:

0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 0 + sqrt(2) + 0 = sqrt(2).

So, P|ψ> = [sqrt(2); 0; sqrt(2)].

Then, <ψ| P |ψ> = (-1)*sqrt(2) + 2*0 + 1*sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)) = 0.

Which is the expectation value.

But what does this tell us?

Not much, because expectation value is 0, but the probability is something else.

Wait, but perhaps it's the variance.

Wait, variance is <P^2> - <P>².

Compute <P^2>:

Compute P squared:

Earlier, we found that P squared is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2;

0, 1/2, 0;

1/2, 0, 1/2]

Therefore, P^2 |ψ>:

First component: (1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2 + 0 + 1/2) = 0.

Second component: 0*(-1) + (1/2)*2 + 0*1 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Third component: (1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2 + 0 + 1/2) = 0.

So, P^2 |ψ> = [0; 1; 0].

Therefore, <P^2> = |ψ>^T P^2 |ψ> = (-1)*0 + 2*1 + 1*0 = 2.

Then, variance = <P^2> - <P>² = 2 - 0 = 2.

Wait, variance is 2, but the question is about probability, so maybe not helpful.

Wait, but if the observable is P, with eigenvalues -1, 0, 1, and the state |ψ> is a superposition of those eigenvectors.

So, in the eigenbasis of P, |ψ> can be written as a sum of eigenvectors.

So, suppose |ψ> = a |e0> + b |e1> + c |e2>, where |e0> is eigenvector for λ=0, |e1> for λ=1, |e2> for λ=-1.

Then, |ψ> is given, so we can compute a, b, c.

But we already found |e0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

|e1> = [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2].

|e2> = [-1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2].

So, express |ψ> as a combination of |e0>, |e1>, |e2>.

Let me set up the equations.

Let |ψ> = a |e0> + b |e1> + c |e2>.

So, component-wise:

First component:

a*(1/sqrt(2)) + b*(1/2) + c*(-1/2) = -1.

Second component:

a*0 + b*(sqrt(2)/2) + c*(sqrt(2)/2) = 2.

Third component:

a*(-1/sqrt(2)) + b*(1/2) + c*(-1/2) = 1.

So, three equations:

1) (a)/sqrt(2) + (b)/2 - (c)/2 = -1.

2) (b sqrt(2))/2 + (c sqrt(2))/2 = 2.

3) (-a)/sqrt(2) + (b)/2 - (c)/2 = 1.

Equation 2 can be simplified:

Factor out sqrt(2)/2: (sqrt(2)/2)(b + c) = 2 => (b + c) = 2 * 2 / sqrt(2) = 4 / sqrt(2) = 2 sqrt(2).

So, equation 2: b + c = 2 sqrt(2).

Equation 1: a/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 = -1.

Equation 3: -a/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 = 1.

Let me denote equation 1: (a)/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 = -1.

Equation 3: (-a)/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 = 1.

Let me add equations 1 and 3:

(a)/sqrt(2) + (-a)/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 + (b - c)/2 = (-1) + 1 => 0 + (b - c) = 0 => b - c = 0 => b = c.

From equation 2: b + c = 2 sqrt(2), and b = c, so 2b = 2 sqrt(2) => b = sqrt(2), c = sqrt(2).

So, b = c = sqrt(2).

From equation 1: a/sqrt(2) + (b - c)/2 = -1.

But b - c = 0, so a/sqrt(2) = -1 => a = -sqrt(2).

So, a = -sqrt(2), b = c = sqrt(2).

So, we have |ψ> expressed as:

|ψ> = -sqrt(2) |e0> + sqrt(2) |e1> + sqrt(2) |e2>.

Therefore, the coefficients are:

a = -sqrt(2) for λ=0,

b = sqrt(2) for λ=1,

c = sqrt(2) for λ=-1.

But the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

Compute |a|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2,

|b|² = 2,

|c|² = 2.

Wait, but 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is not 1. So, that can't be.

But that's because, in expressing |ψ> in terms of the eigenstates, the coefficients must satisfy |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = 1.

But here, they sum to 6, which is wrong.

Therefore, there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check.

Express |ψ> = a |e0> + b |e1> + c |e2>.

We found a = -sqrt(2), b = sqrt(2), c = sqrt(2).

Compute ||ψ||²: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

But in reality, ||ψ||² = 6, but when expressed in terms of |e0>, |e1>, |e2>, the sum of squares of coefficients should be 1.

But in our case, sum of squares is 6. Therefore, something is wrong.

Wait, no, our |e0>, |e1>, |e2> are not orthonormal. Because P is symmetric, so its eigenvectors are orthogonal, but not necessarily normalized. Wait, no, earlier we normalized them.

Wait, earlier, we found |e0>, |e1>, |e2> to be orthonormal.

Wait, let me check.

Compute <e0|e1>:

[1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)] ⋅ [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2] = (1/sqrt(2))(1/2) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2))(1/2) = (1/(2 sqrt(2)) - 1/(2 sqrt(2))) = 0.

Similarly, <e0|e2>: 0.

<e1|e2>: [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2] ⋅ [-1/2; sqrt(2)/2; -1/2] = (1/2)(-1/2) + (sqrt(2)/2)(sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2)(-1/2) = (-1/4) + (2/4) + (-1/4) = 0.

So, the eigenvectors are orthonormal, so the coefficients a, b, c must satisfy |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = ||ψ||² = 6. Which is not 1. So, that can't be.

Wait, but that suggests that |ψ> is not expressed correctly in terms of the eigenbasis of P.

Which is a contradiction, because any vector can be expressed in terms of an orthonormal basis.

Wait, perhaps this is due to the fact that P is not diagonal, so the eigenvectors are not orthogonal in the standard basis? No, but P has orthogonal eigenvectors.

Wait, I must have messed up the eigenvectors.

Wait, no, earlier, we found |e0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)], |e1> = [1/2; sqrt(2)/2; 1/2], |e
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem here where the system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). There's an observable represented by a matrix operator P, and I need to calculate the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t. The answer is supposed to be √(2/3), but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what I know about observables and measurements in quantum mechanics. An observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and its measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of this matrix. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the system's state vector.

So, in this case, the observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific entries. Let me write down the matrix P to get a clearer picture:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0  

Hmm, that looks like a symmetric matrix. I think it's a type of tridiagonal matrix, but with zeros on the diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonals. Wait, no, actually, the diagonal entries are all zero. So, it's a symmetric matrix with diagonal elements zero and the first off-diagonals being 1/√2. That structure makes me think it's related to some kind of spin operator or perhaps something to do with states in a three-level system.

Given that, the next step is to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. Once I have the eigenvalues, I can find the corresponding eigenvectors and then project the system's state vector onto those eigenvectors to compute the probabilities.

Wait, but the problem says the measurement will yield 0. So, is 0 an eigenvalue of P? I should check.

Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P. Since P is symmetric, its eigenvalues are real, and it's diagonalizable with an orthogonal set of eigenvectors.

The characteristic equation of P is given by det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write down P - λI:

[ -λ , 1/√2 , 0 ]  
[1/√2, -λ , 1/√2]  
[ 0 , 1/√2, -λ ]

Now, the determinant of this 3x3 matrix should be zero. Let me compute it.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix:

|A| = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

So, for our matrix:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0  
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2  
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

Let me denote the matrix as:

a  b   c  
d  e   f  
g  h   i

So, a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0  
d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2  
g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

Then, determinant |P - λI| is:

a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Plugging in the values:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*(something)

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)[ λ² - (1/2) ]  
Second term: - (1/√2)[ (-λ/√2) - 0 ]  
Third term: 0

So, let's compute each part:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2  
Second term: - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2  
Third term: 0

So, the total determinant is:

(-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

So, set this equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0  
=> λ(-λ² + 1) = 0  
Thus, λ = 0 or λ² = 1  
Which gives λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1

So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Therefore, the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1. So, measuring the observable P will yield 0, 1, or -1.

Since the system's state is given, we can compute the probability of each outcome by projecting the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvectors and then taking the square of the norm.

Wait, but before that, let me make sure I haven't made any calculation errors in the determinant.

Let me double-check the determinant calculation.

The determinant was for the matrix:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]  
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]  
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

I used the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion? Actually, I used the cofactor expansion along the first row.

So, expansion along the first row:

-λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ] - (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ] + 0 * det(...)

Compute each minor:

First minor: det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ] = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2

Second minor: det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ] = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2 - 0 = -λ/√2

Third minor: doesn't matter because it's multiplied by zero.

So, plugging back in:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2)  
Second term: - (1/√2)(-λ/√2)  
Third term: 0

Compute first term: -λ³ + (λ)/2  
Second term: - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) simplifies as (λ)/(2)  
Third term: 0

Wait, let's compute the second term in more detail.

Second term is - (1/√2) multiplied by the minor, which is -λ/√2. So, - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(√2 * √2) = λ/2.

So, the second term is +λ/2, because of the double negative.

So, total determinant: (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ.

So, yes, that's correct. So, determinant is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Thus, eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue, so the probability of measuring 0 is not zero. Got it.

Now, next step: find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Then, project the state vector onto each eigenvector to find the probabilities.

Given the system's state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this vector as |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

To find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to compute the projection of |ψ⟩ onto the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The square of the norm of this projection will give the probability.

So, let's find the eigenvector for λ = 0. That is, solve (P - 0I)|v⟩ = 0, which is P|v⟩ = 0.

So, P|v⟩ = 0, where |v⟩ = [ v1, v2, v3 ]^T.

So, writing out the equations:

From the first row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

From the second row: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

From the third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, same as the first row. So, v2 = 0, and v1 = -v3.

So, eigenvector is [ v1, 0, -v1 ] for some non-zero scalar v1.

So, let me write |v⟩ = v [1, 0, -1]^T, where v is a normalization constant.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 0, -1].

Now, I need to normalize this eigenvector. Let's compute its norm.

||v||² = (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So, |v_normalized⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto |v_normalized⟩.

The projection is given by:

⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1] * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T

Compute the dot product:

(1/√2)[ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = (1/√2)[ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/√2)(-2) = -√2 / √2 = -1

Wait, the inner product is -1. Then, the probability is the squared magnitude, which is (-1)^2 = 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the probability can't exceed 1, but in this case, the square is 1, which is okay, but the answer is supposed to be √(2/3). So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation.

Projection is ⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (1/√2)(-2) = -√2

Then, the probability is |⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩|² = (-√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, that's even worse. That would give a probability of 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, something's definitely wrong here.

Wait, so step back.

Maybe I made a mistake in normalizing the eigenvector. Wait, |v⟩ is [1, 0, -1]^T. So, its norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T. That's correct.

Projection: (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] • [ -1, 2, 1 ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) (-1 -1) = (1/sqrt(2)) (-2) = -sqrt(2). So, the inner product is -sqrt(2). Therefore, the square is (sqrt(2))² = 2. So, probability is 2? That can't be.

Wait, but that suggests that the projection gives a result with probability 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So, I must have messed up something here.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I didn't account for the fact that the eigenvector is normalized, but the state vector isn't necessarily of unit length. Wait, no, the projection formula already accounts for that.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the observable P is not the one whose eigenvalues I need to consider? Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the probability is computed as |⟨φ| P |ψ⟩|², where φ is the eigenvector.

But in this case, is P the observable? Or is the observable something else? Wait, no, P is the observable, so the probability of measuring λ is |⟨v| ψ⟩|², where v is the eigenvector for λ.

Wait, but in our case, when λ=0, the projection is |v_normalized • ψ|. So, the squared magnitude.

But as I computed, it's 2, which can't be. So, that suggests that either I made a wrong eigenvector or perhaps the observable is given incorrectly.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of the eigenvalue.

Earlier, when computing the determinant, I got -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0 => λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1. That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe the matrix P is actually a different kind of operator. Let me think about whether I wrote down P correctly.

From the problem statement: P has first row (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row (0, 1/√2, 0). So, yes, that's the P matrix. So, the matrix is correct.

Wait, maybe I have to compute the probability differently. Hmm, perhaps the system is in a mixed state? No, the state is given as a column vector, so it's a pure state.

Wait, perhaps I have to compute the expectation value instead of the probability. But no, the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0, so it should be |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

Wait, if the projection is giving me a squared magnitude of 2, that suggests that the eigenvector is not normalized, but in reality, the eigenvector was normalized, so ||v_normalized||² is 1.

Wait, hold on, let me compute the projection again.

Compute ⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩:

(1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/√2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (1/√2)(-2) = -√2

Then, the squared magnitude is (-√2)^2 = 2.

But that's the probability. So, it's 2? Which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

So, maybe I did something wrong here. Maybe the observable is not correctly given? Or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the system's state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Is that a row or column vector? The problem says a column matrix. So, it's a column vector, right?

Wait, let me check: when I compute the projection, it's |⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩|², which is ( -√2 )² = 2. But 2 is greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities must be between 0 and 1.

So, I must have an error in calculating the projection. Let me try again.

Compute the inner product:

v_normalized = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T  
ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

Dot product:  
(1/√2)*(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)  
= (1/√2)*(-1 + 0 -1)  
= (1/√2)*(-2)  
= -√2

Then, the magnitude squared is (-√2)^2 = 2.

Hmm, same result. So, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me confirm: for λ=0, we have P|v⟩ = 0.

So, equations are:

(1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2=0  
(1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3=0  
Similarly, v2=0.

So, v1 = -v3.

So, eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

So, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the system is in a different basis? No, the state is given as a column vector, so it's in the standard basis.

Wait, maybe I have to compute the projection onto the eigenspace? Wait, for a symmetric matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, so each eigenvalue has a one-dimensional eigenspace.

Wait, so for λ=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T. So, I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, then the problem arises: if the projection squared gives me 2, which is greater than 1, that suggests that the system is in a state that's not normalized.

Wait, let me check the norm of ψ.

Compute ||ψ||²: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So, ψ is a vector with norm sqrt(6). So, it's not a unit vector.

So, when I compute the projection, the squared magnitude is 2, but since ψ is not normalized, that 2 is the probability over the squared norm.

Wait, no. Wait, the projection is (⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩), which gives a scalar. The probability is |⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩|².

But regardless of ψ's norm, this would be the probability.

Wait, let's think of ψ as a vector with norm sqrt(6). So, |⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩|² is equal to ( |v_normalized • ψ| )².

Which is ( | (1/√2)(-2) | )² = ( sqrt(2) )² = 2.

But the probability is the squared magnitude, which is 2, but the probability can't exceed 1. So, that's a contradiction. So, how is that possible?

Wait, maybe the observable is not correctly normalized? Or perhaps P is not correctly given.

Wait, perhaps the operator P is scaled. Let me check the trace of P. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So, its trace is zero, which is consistent with having eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

Wait, the operator norm is the maximum eigenvalue in absolute value, which is 1. So, that's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is not the observable itself but something else. Wait, no, the problem states that P is the observable.

Wait, could it be that the observable is given as P, but in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, which P is, so that's fine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the inner product. Let me compute it again.

v_normalized is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Inner product:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*(1)  
= (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2)  
= (-2)/√2  
= -√2

So, the inner product is -√2, so its square is 2. So, the probability is 2. That can't be, because probability can't exceed 1.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the observable is diagonal, but no, P is given as a matrix with non-zero off-diagonal elements.

Wait, let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different basis. Wait, but the state is given as a column vector, so it's in the standard basis.

Wait, unless the system's state is represented in a different basis. Maybe I need to perform a change of basis.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about different bases. So, probably not.

Wait, another thought: maybe the probability is actually |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², but that would be scaling it by the norm squared. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |⟨φ|i⟩|², where |i⟩ is the basis vector. But here, we're projecting onto an eigenvector.

Wait, but if the state is |ψ⟩, and |v⟩ is the normalized eigenvector, then the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|². But since |ψ⟩ is not normalized, |⟨v|ψ⟩|² would be (⟨v|ψ⟩)(⟨ψ|v⟩) = ||v||² ||ψ||² cos²θ, where θ is the angle between them.

But since |v⟩ is normalized, ||v||² =1, so the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But ⟨v|ψ⟩ is a scalar, and its square is the probability, regardless of the state's normalization.

Wait, but in this case, ⟨v|ψ⟩ is -√2, so squared is 2, which is the probability.

But that's impossible because probability cannot exceed 1. So, that suggests that either the state is not normalized, or there's a miscalculation in the eigenvector.

Wait, let me check the system's state. The problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So, that's a column vector with components (-1, 2, 1). So, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6).

So, yes, it is a valid state vector, but not normalized.

But when computing the probability, it's |⟨v|ψ⟩|², which is 2, but as a probability, it's 2 / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, because the projection formula is:

P(v) = (⟨v|ψ⟩)(⟨ψ|v⟩) = |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But since ψ is not normalized, this is equal to ||v||² ||ψ||² cos²θ. But since ||v||²=1, it's just ||ψ||² cos²θ.

But in this case, the projection is 2, but the probability is 2 / ||ψ||², because the normalized probability is P = |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, actually, I think I mixed up. Let me refer back to the definition.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue λ is |⟨v|ψ⟩|², where |v⟩ is the eigenvector. But this is only when |ψ⟩ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P.

But in our case, |ψ⟩ is not necessarily in the eigenbasis of P. So, actually, the projection formula is |⟨v|ψ⟩|², which is (v • ψ)(ψ • v) = |v • ψ|².

But since both |v⟩ and |ψ⟩ are vectors, their inner product is a scalar, and its square is the probability, regardless of their norms.

But for the probability to be less than or equal to 1, this scalar must have absolute value ≤ 1. But in this case, |v • ψ| = sqrt(2), so squared is 2, which is greater than 1.

This suggests that something is wrong here. Either the eigenvector is not correctly calculated, or the way I'm computing the projection is wrong.

Wait, let me check the eigenvector again.

We had P|v⟩ = 0, so:

- First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2=0  
- Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3  
- Third equation: same as the first ⇒ v2=0

So, eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1]^T, which is correct.

So, normalized: (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T.

So, computing ⟨v_normalized | ψ⟩:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So, inner product is -√2, square is 2.

Wait, so the probability is 2? That can't be. So, maybe the eigenvector is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I made a wrong assumption about the observable. Is P an observable? Or is it the measurement operator? Wait, in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, which P is.

But when measuring, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are 0, 1, -1. So, when you measure P, you could get 0, 1, or -1.

But if the projection onto the eigenvector for 0 gives a probability of 2, which is impossible, then perhaps the problem is in the way the observable is given.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the operator P is not correctly written. Let me check the entries again.

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Yes, that's the P matrix.

Wait, so P is a symmetric matrix with zero diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal. Hmm, this looks familiar. It's similar to the adjacency matrix of a path graph with three nodes, but with 1/√2 instead of 1. Or is it similar to the spin operator in some basis.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the spectral decomposition of P.

If P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, then P can be written as P = 0 * |v0⟩⟨v0| + 1 * |v1⟩⟨v1| + (-1)|v-1⟩⟨v-1|

Then, the probability of measuring 0 is ||⟨v0|ψ⟩||².

But as we have computed, ||⟨v0|ψ⟩||² = 2, which is not possible. So, perhaps the mistake is that I have an incorrect eigenvector.

Wait, let me recast the equations for P|v⟩ = 0.

Let me write P as:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]  
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]  
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

So, P|v⟩ = 0:

First component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2=0  
Second component: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3  
Third component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0

So, same as before, v2=0, v1=-v3. So, eigenvector is [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

So, that's correct.

Thus, I must have made a mistake in the projection.

Wait, the projection is |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But ψ is not normalized. So, perhaps the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, yes, because the projection of ψ onto v is (⟨v|ψ⟩)(⟨ψ|v⟩) = |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But since ψ is not normalized, the projection is 2, but the probability is (|⟨v|ψ⟩|²) / ||ψ||².

Wait, ||ψ||² is 6, so probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

But wait, the given answer is sqrt(2/3). So, that doesn't match either. Hmm.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, while sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.816. So, that's quite different.

So, now I'm confused. So, if I do |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², I get 2 / 6 = 1/3. But the correct answer is sqrt(2/3).

Wait, perhaps I need to normalize ψ first. Let me think.

In quantum mechanics, when you compute the probability of a measurement, you can either work with normalized vectors or not. If ψ is not normalized, you can either normalize it or compute the probability as |⟨v|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, if I normalize ψ first, then the probability is |⟨v_normalized|ψ_normalized⟩|².

So, let me try that approach.

Compute ψ_normalized = ψ / ||ψ|| = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

Then, compute ⟨v_normalized | ψ_normalized⟩:

= (1/√2)(1*(-1)/sqrt(6) + 0*2/sqrt(6) + (-1)*1/sqrt(6))  
= (1/√2)( (-1 -1)/sqrt(6) )  
= (1/√2)( -2/sqrt(6) )  
= (-2) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))  
= (-2) / (sqrt(12))  
= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3))  
= -1 / sqrt(3)

Then, the probability is | -1/sqrt(3) |² = 1/3.

Again, 1/3.

But the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). Hmm.

Wait, but 1/3 is about 0.333, which is less than sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816. So, that doesn't match.

Wait, but perhaps the observable is not correctly given? Or perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the observable's operator.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value instead, but the problem asks for probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the spectral decomposition differently.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of the projection operator.

The projection onto the eigenspace of λ=0 is P_0 = |v0⟩⟨v0|, where |v0⟩ is the eigenvector.

So, the probability is ⟨ψ| P_0 |ψ⟩ = ||P_0 ψ||².

Compute P_0 = |v0⟩⟨v0| = (1/2)[1,0,-1][1,0,-1].

So, P_0 ψ = (1/2)[1,0,-1][ -1, 2, 1 ].

Compute that:

(1/2)[ (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ) ] = (1/2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (1/2)(-2) = -1.

So, P_0 ψ = -1. Then, the norm squared is (-1)^2 = 1.

Wait, but that's 1. So, the probability is 1. But that can't be because the answer is sqrt(2/3).

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, P_0 is the projection operator, but when I compute P_0 ψ, I get a vector, whose norm squared is the probability.

But in this case, P_0 ψ = -1 * |v0⟩, which has norm sqrt( ( -1 )² * (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( (1)*(1/2) ) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2. So, the norm squared is 1/2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Wait, no.

Wait, P_0 is the projection onto |v0⟩, which is (1/2)[1, 0, -1]. So, P_0 is:

(1/2)[1, 0, -1][1, 0, -1] = (1/2)[1, 0, -1]

So, when you multiply P_0 by ψ, you get:

(1/2)[1, 0, -1] * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T

= (1/2)[ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ]  
= (1/2)(-2)  
= -1

So, P_0 ψ = -1. So, now, ||P_0 ψ||² = |-1|² = 1.

But the probability is ||P_0 ψ||² = 1.

But this contradicts because the system state is ψ, so the probability of measuring 0 is 1? That can't be.

Wait, this is all confusing. Let me take a step back.

Alternative approach: Maybe change the basis.

Wait, perhaps the system is in a different basis, but the problem didn't specify. So, I think that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the observable is not the same as the operator given.

Wait, or perhaps the observable is represented by the transpose of P? No, since P is symmetric, the transpose is the same.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable is not P, but P^T or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a three-dimensional space, but the observable is in a one-dimensional subspace. Hmm, but the projection is still onto the eigenvector.

Wait, is there a different way to compute the probability? Maybe by diagonalizing P and expressing ψ in terms of the eigenvectors.

So, let me try to compute the spectral decomposition.

We have eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, -1.

Let me find the corresponding eigenvectors.

For λ=1, solve (P - I)|v⟩ = 0.

So, P - I = [ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]  
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]  
[ 0, 1/√2, -1 ]

So, equations:

First row: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0  
Second row: (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
Third row: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0

From first equation: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v1 = (1/√2)v2.

From third equation: (1/√2)v2 - v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = (1/√2)v2.

From second equation: (1/√2)v1 - v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0.

Substitute v1 and v3:

(1/√2)*(1/√2)v2 - v2 + (1/√2)*(1/√2)v2 = 0  
(1/2)v2 - v2 + (1/2)v2 = 0  
(1/2 -1 + 1/2)v2 = 0  
( (1/2 + 1/2) -1 )v2 = 0  
(1 -1)v2 =0 ⇒ 0=0.

Thus, the equations are consistent, and eigenvectors are proportional to [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T.

Normalize this vector:

Compute norm squared: (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2) = 2.

So, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1, √2, 1]^T.

Similarly for λ=-1.

For λ=-1, solve (P + I)|v⟩ = 0.

P + I = [1, 1/√2, 0]  
[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]  
[0, 1/√2, 1]

Equations:

First row: v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0  
Second row: (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0  
Third row: (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0

From first equation: v1 = - (1/√2)v2.

From third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2.

Plug into second equation:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2)v2 = 0  
(-1/2)v2 + v2 - (1/2)v2 = 0  
( (-1/2 - 1/2 )v2 ) + v2 = 0  
(-v2) + v2 = 0 ⇒ 0=0.

Thus, eigenvectors are proportional to [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T.

Normalize:

Compute norm squared: ( (-1/√2)^2 ) + 1^2 + ( (-1/√2)^2 ) = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2.

So, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[ -1, √2, -1 ]^T.

Okay, so now, the three eigenvectors are:

λ=0: |v0⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T  
λ=1: |v1⟩ = (1/√2)[1, √2, 1]^T  
λ=-1: |v-1⟩ = (1/√2)[ -1, √2, -1 ]^T

Now, to compute the probability of measuring λ=0, we need the projection of ψ onto |v0⟩.

Compute ⟨v0 | ψ⟩.

v0 = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T  
ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

Dot product: (1/√2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ) = (1/√2)(-1 -1) = (1/√2)(-2) = -√2.

So, the projection is -√2, so the probability is | -√2 |² = 2.

But since the system is in state ψ with ||ψ||²=6, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, so the probability is 1/3, but the answer is supposed to be sqrt(2/3). That's conflicting.

Wait, so what is the correct way?

Alternatively, perhaps I have to use the spectral decomposition.

Express ψ in terms of the eigenvectors of P.

But that would require knowing the matrix representation in the eigenbasis, which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem statement or in my computation.

Wait, but let me think differently.

Suppose I compute the expectation value of P in the state ψ.

⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩ = | -1 |²*(0) + |2|²*(1/√2) + |1|²*(0) ? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩, which can be computed as:

Compute each entry:

First row of P: 0, 1/√2, 0  
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2  
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So, compute ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩:

= 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1  
+ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1  
+ 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1

Compute term by term:

First term: 0*(-1) = 0  
Second term: (1/√2)*2 = 2/√2  
Third term: 0*1 = 0  
Fourth term: (1/√2)*(-1) = -1/√2  
Fifth term: 0*2 = 0  
Sixth term: (1/√2)*1 = 1/√2

Adding them up:

0 + 2/√2 -1/√2 + 0 + 1/√2 = (2/√2) + ( -1/√2 + 1/√2 ) = 2/√2 + 0 = √2.

So, the expectation value is √2.

But how does that relate to the probability?

Wait, the expectation value is given by Tr(P ρ), where ρ is the density matrix. The diagonal entries of ρ are the probabilities of the eigenstates.

So, if the expectation value is ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩ = √2, and the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. Then, the expectation value can also be written as 0 * p0 + 1 * p1 + (-1) * p-1, where p0, p1, p-1 are the probabilities.

So, √2 = p1 - p-1

But we need to find p0, p1, p-1 such that p0 + p1 + p-1 =1.

But we also have that the probability of measuring 0 is p0 = |⟨v0| ψ⟩|² = 2.

But wait, that would mean p0 =2, which is greater than 1, which is impossible.

So, that suggests that something is wrong.

Wait, but ⟨v0|ψ⟩ = -√2, so p0 = | -√2 |² =2.

So, p0=2, p1 + p-1= -√2, but since probabilities can't be negative, that's a problem.

Wait, something's definitely wrong.

Given that the expectation value is √2, and that the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1, the expectation value is equal to 1*p1 -1*p-1.

So, 1*p1 -1*p-1 = √2.

But since p1 and p-1 are probabilities, they must be non-negative and sum to 1 - p0.

But if p0=2, which is more than 1, that's impossible.

Wait, so I think the problem is that I computed p0=2, but since probabilities can't exceed 1, that's impossible. So, that suggests that there is an error in my calculation.

Wait, but I double-checked the projection.

Wait, maybe the system is in a different Hilbert space? Or maybe the observable is not correctly given.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's state is not normalized, but the observable is given in a different basis, leading to confusion.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I got the transpose of the matrix wrong. Let me check.

From the problem statement: first row of P is (0, 1/√2, 0), second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row is (0, 1/√2, 0).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me try to compute the expectation value another way.

Compute Tr(P ρ), where ρ is the density matrix, ρ= |ψ⟩⟨ψ| / ||ψ||².

So, Tr(P ρ) = (1/||ψ||²) Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| )

Which would be the expectation value.

But earlier, I computed it as √2.

Alternatively, maybe the expectation value is equal to the sum over the eigenvalues λ, of λ * (probability of λ).

So, expectation value E[ P ] = 0 * p0 + 1 * p1 + (-1) * p-1.

But from my earlier projection, p0=2, but that's impossible.

Wait, that suggests that maybe I made a wrong assumption about the eigenvectors.

Wait, but the eigenvectors are correct. Or, maybe the operator P is not correctly given.

Wait, if I compute P acting on |v0⟩, it should give zero.

Compute P|v0⟩ where |v0⟩ is [1, 0, -1]^T.

P|v0⟩ = [0*(1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1), (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1), 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) ]  
= [0, (1/√2 -1/√2), 0]  
= [0, 0, 0]

So, yes, correct.

Wait, then what is the issue?

Wait, perhaps the system is in a different basis where the observable is diagonal, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation in the projection.

Wait, let's suppose that the projection gives |⟨v0|ψ⟩|²=2, but since the system is in state ψ, which is not normalized, the actual probability is 2 / ||ψ||² = 2 /6 =1/3.

But the problem states that the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). That is approximately 0.816.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.333.

So, different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me compute determinant of P - λI again.

| P - λI | = -λ³ + λ.

Wait, is that correct?

Compute determinant again.

First row: -λ, 1/√2, 0  
Second row:1/√2, -λ, 1/√2  
Third row:0,1/√2, -λ

Compute determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0  
= -λ*(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2)  
= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2  
= -λ³ + λ

Yes, correct.

So, eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

Therefore, p0=2 is impossible.

Wait, so either the problem is incorrect, or my entire approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different Hilbert space. For example, maybe the system is two-dimensional, and the state is being projected incorrectly.

Wait, but the problem says the state is a column matrix with three elements, so it's in 3D space.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observable is represented by the transpose of P. But since P is symmetric, it's the same.

Alternatively, maybe I need to compute the probability as the expectation value divided by something. But expectation value is √2. But that doesn't match.

Wait, hold on, perhaps the observable is not P itself, but P squared or something else.

Wait, the problem says "an observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P". So, it's P itself, not a different operator.

Wait, maybe the observable is not P, but another operator related to P. Or perhaps it's a different basis.

Wait, now I think I might have confused P with another operator. Let me check the standard notation.

In quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, which is what P is.

But in the measurement basis, the probability is given by the projection onto the eigenvectors.

But if I get an impossible probability, that suggests that either the operator is not correctly given or the state is incorrectly given.

Wait, but the state is given as (-1,2,1). Maybe the user made a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observable is represented by P, but the system is in a different basis.

Wait, for example, maybe the state is written in a different basis, so the projection is different.

But the problem didn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps the observable is in a different basis.

Wait, but no, the state is given as a column vector, so it's in the standard basis.

Wait, now I'm really stuck.

Wait, maybe if I compute the probability of measuring 1 instead of 0.

Compute projection onto |v1⟩:

v1 = (1/√2)[1, √2, 1]^T.

Dot product with ψ: (1/√2)(1*(-1) + √2*2 + 1*1 ) = (1/√2)( -1 + 2√2 +1 ) = (1/√2)(2√2 ) = (1/√2)(2√2 ) = 2.

So, |2|²=4. So, probability is 4 /6 = 2/3.

Similarly, projection onto |v-1⟩:

v-1 = (1/√2)[ -1, √2, -1 ]^T.

Dot product with ψ: (1/√2)( (-1)(-1) + √2*2 + (-1)*1 ) = (1/√2)(1 + 2√2 -1 ) = (1/√2)(2√2 ) = 2.

Thus, probability is 4 /6= 2/3.

So, p1=2/3, p-1=2/3, and p0=1/3.

Thus, the probabilities are 1/3, 2/3, 2/3.

But the given answer is sqrt(2/3), which is approximately 0.816, which would be close to 2/3 (≈0.666). So, not matching.

But let's check p0=1/3, which is approximately 0.333, which is not sqrt(2/3). So, something is wrong here.

Wait, but maybe I have to recompute the projection.

Wait, for |v0⟩, projection gives -√2, which squared is 2, but the probability is 2 / ||ψ||² =2/6=1/3.

But the answer is sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the observable is not P, but another matrix related to P.

Wait, the problem says "an observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P".

So, P is the observable.

Wait, is there a different approach to compute the probability?

Wait, perhaps using the density matrix.

Density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| / ||ψ||² = (1/6)[ -1, 2, 1; -1, 2, 1; -1, 2, 1 ].

Then, Tr( P ρ ) = Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ) / ||ψ||².

But we already computed Tr( P ρ ) = √2, so √2 /6 ≈ 0.2357.

But that's the expectation value, not the probability.

Wait, no, the expectation value is Tr( P ρ ) = sum λ_i p_i.

In our case, sum λ_i p_i = 0*(1/3) +1*(2/3) + (-1)*(2/3)= 0 + 2/3 -2/3=0.

But earlier, I computed the expectation value as √2. Which is contradictory.

Wait, no, that's not. Wait, let me compute Tr(P rho):

Compute Tr( P rho ) = Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| / ||ψ||² ) = (1/||ψ||²) Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ).

Compute Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ) = Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ).

But, Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ) = Tr( |ψ⟩⟨ψ| P ) = Tr( (P |ψ⟩)⟨ψ| ).

Which is the same as Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ).

But in our case, Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ) = √2.

Therefore, Tr( P rho ) = √2 /6 ≈ 0.2357.

But wait, earlier, when I computed expectation value as sum λ_i p_i, I get 0.

But √2 /6 is not zero. Contradiction.

Wait, that suggests that my computation is wrong.

Wait, no, let's compute Tr( P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ). Which is:

P |ψ⟩ = P*(-1,2,1)^T = [0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 +0*1, (1/√2)*(-1) +0*2 + (1/√2)*1, 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 +0*1 ]^T

So, first component: 0 + 2/√2 +0= √2  
Second component: (-1)/√2 +0 +1/√2=0  
Third component:0 + 2/√2 +0= √2

Thus, P|ψ⟩ = [√2, 0, √2]^T.

Thus, P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| = [√2,0,√2] [ -1,2,1 ] = [√2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1, √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1, √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1 ]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, to compute P|ψ⟩⟨ψ|, it's the outer product.

Wait, P|ψ⟩ = [√2, 0, √2]^T.

Then, P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| = [√2, 0, √2] [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Compute:

First component: √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1 = -√2 + 0 + √2 = 0  
Second component: √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1 = -√2 + 0 + √2 =0  
Third component: √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1 = -√2 +0 + √2=0.

Wait, so P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| is a 3x3 matrix with zeros everywhere.

Therefore, Tr(P|ψ⟩⟨ψ|)=0.

Thus, Tr(P rho)=0.

Which aligns with the expectation value being zero.

Wait, but that conflicts with my earlier computation where I thought the expectation value was √2.

Wait, no, let's recast.

Wait, when I computed Tr(P |ψ⟩⟨ψ| ), I computed it incorrectly.

First, P|ψ⟩ = [√2, 0, √2]^T.

So, P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| is equal to [√2,0,√2][ -1,2,1 ].

Wait, to get the outer product, it's [√2,0,√2] * [ -1,2,1 ]^T.

But the outer product is a matrix where each element (i,j) is √2*(-1) +0*2 + √2*1 =0, as above.

So, P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| is zero matrix.

Thus, Tr(P|ψ⟩⟨ψ| )=0.

Therefore, Tr(P rho )=0.

So, the expectation value is zero.

Thus, Tr(P rho )= sum λ_i p_i =0.

Given that, and knowing that p0 +p1 +p-1=1,

and that sum λ_i p_i=0,

but from before, p0= |⟨v0|ψ⟩|²=2, which is impossible.

Wait, but earlier, computing Tr(P rho )=0 is correct, but that doesn't help.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/3, but the user says it's sqrt(2/3). So, I think either the problem is wrong or my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use a different observable.

Wait, maybe the observable is represented by P^2 or something else.

Wait, if I compute P^2, let me compute what it is.

Compute P^2:

P is a 3x3 matrix.

First row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]  
Second row: [1/√2,0,1/√2]  
Third row: [0,1/√2,0]

Compute P^2:

First row, first column: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0= 1/2  
First row, second column:0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2)=0  
First row, third column:0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0=1/2

Second row, first column: (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0=0  
Second row, second column: (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2)=1/2 +1/2=1  
Second row, third column: (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0=0

Third row, first column:0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0=1/2  
Third row, second column:0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 +0*(1/√2)=0  
Third row, third column:0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) +0*0=1/2

Thus, P^2= [ [1/2,0,1/2],[0,1,0],[1/2,0,1/2] ]

Compute the eigenvalues of P^2.

Since P is symmetric, P^2 is also symmetric.

Compute determinant of P^2 - λI.

Matrix:

[1/2 - λ, 0, 1/2 ]  
[0,1 - λ, 0 ]  
[1/2, 0,1/2 - λ ]

Compute determinant:

(1/2 - λ)[(1 - λ)(1/2 - λ) - 0 ] -0 + (1/2)[0 - (1 - λ)(1/2) ]

= (1/2 - λ)( (1 - λ)(1/2 - λ) ) + (1/2)*( - (1 - λ)(1/2) )

Let me compute term by term.

First term: (1/2 - λ)( (1 - λ)(1/2 - λ) )

Let me denote A = (1/2 - λ), B = (1 - λ).

Then, first term = A * (B * A) = A² B.

Second term: (1/2)*(- (1 - λ)(1/2) ) = - (1/2)*(1 - λ)*1/2 = - (1 - λ)/4.

So, compute determinant:

= A² B - (1 - λ)/4.

But A = (1/2 - λ), B = (1 - λ).

So, A² = (1/2 - λ)^2 = (λ -1/2)^2.

So, determinant:

= (λ -1/2)^2 (1 - λ) - (1 - λ)/4.

Factor out (1 - λ):

= (1 - λ)[(λ -1/2)^2 - 1/4 ]

Compute inside the brackets:

(λ -1/2)^2 -1/4 = (λ² - λ + 1/4) -1/4 = λ² - λ.

Thus, determinant:

= (1 - λ)(λ² - λ ) = (1 - λ)λ(λ -1 )

= - (1 - λ)^2 λ

Set determinant to zero:

- (1 - λ)^2 λ =0 ⇒ λ=0, λ=1 (double root).

So, eigenvalues of P^2 are 0,1,1.

Thus, the square of the observable P has eigenvalues 0,1,1.

Thus, if the observable was P^2, then the probabilities would be different.

But the problem states that the observable is P, not P^2.

Thus, maybe the problem was supposed to be with P^2. Because then, the eigenvalues are 0,1,1, and the probabilities would be different.

Let me check.

If the observable is P^2, then we can compute the probability of measuring 0 as |⟨v0|ψ⟩|², where v0 is the eigenvector for λ=0.

But for P^2, the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector [1,0,0]^T or something else.

Wait, P^2 has eigenvalues 0,1,1.

So, for λ=0, we solve (P^2 -0I)|v⟩=0, which is P^2|v⟩=0.

Compute P^2:

[1/2,0,1/2]  
[0,1,0]  
[1/2,0,1/2]

So, P^2|v⟩=0.

Equations:

First component: (1/2)v1 + (1/2)v3 =0  
Second component: v2 =0  
Third component: same as first: (1/2)v1 + (1/2)v3=0

Thus, v2=0, and from first equation, v1 = -v3.

So, eigenvector is [v1,0,-v1]^T, which is same as for P.

Wait, so for P^2, the eigenvector for λ=0 is same as for P.

So, projection onto |v0⟩.

But since P^2 has eigenvalues 0,1,1, so if the system is in state ψ, the probability of getting 0 is |⟨v0|ψ⟩|²=2, same as before.

But since P^2 is a different operator, but the problem states that the observable is P, so... I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/3, but the user said it's sqrt(2/3). So, I must be missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the system is in a superposition of the eigenvectors, so the probability is computed differently.

But in any case, I need to find the probability of getting 0, which is |⟨v0|ψ⟩|²=2, but since ||ψ||²=6, the probability is 2/6=1/3.

But the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, something is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the projection.

Wait, compute ⟨v0|ψ⟩:

v0 = (1/√2)[1,0,-1]^T  
ψ = [-1,2,1]^T

Dot product: (1/√2)[1*(-1) +0*2 + (-1)*1 ]= (1/√2)(-1 -1)= (1/√2)(-2)= -√2.

Thus, probability is | -√2 |²=2.

But since the system is in state ψ, which is not normalized, the probability is 2 / ||ψ||²=2/6=1/3.

But the correct answer is sqrt(2/3).

Wait, sqrt(2/3) squared is 2/3, which is about 0.666.

But my computation gives 1/3≈0.333. So, different.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different state.

Wait, the state is given as (-1,2,1). If I had a different state, would I get sqrt(2/3).

Suppose the state is [1,1,1]^T, then.

Compute projection onto |v0⟩:

(1/√2)(1*1 +0*1 + (-1)*1 )= (1/√2)(1 -1)=0.

Probability 0.

Alternatively, if state is [0,1,0], projection onto |v0⟩ is (1/√2)(0 +0 +0)=0.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the system is in a different basis where the observable P is diagonal.

But without more information, I can't compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is represented by the transpose of P.

But since P is symmetric, same result.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the probability using the spectral decomposition differently.

Wait, given that, and that the expectation value is zero, but p0=2 is impossible.

Wait, maybe the observable is given incorrectly.

Wait, in the problem statement: first row (0,1/√2,0), second row (1/√2,0,1/√2), third row (0,1/√2,0). So, P is correct.

Thus, given all the above, I think the correct probability is 1/3, but the answer is given as sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the projection.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the system is in state (-1,2,1). The observable is P with given matrix. The correct answer is sqrt(2/3). But according to my calculations, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, maybe the observable is not the same as P. Wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So, perhaps the observable is P / √2 or something else.

Wait, if I divide P by √2, then P becomes:

First row:0,1/√2 /√2=1/2,0  
Second row:1/√2 /√2=1/2,0,1/√2 /√2=1/2  
Third row:0,1/√2 /√2=1/2,0

So, P' = [ [0,1/2,0],[1/2,0,1/2],[0,1/2,0] ]

Now, compute eigenvalues of P':

The matrix is:

0 1/2 0  
1/2 0 1/2  
0 1/2 0

Compute determinant of P' - λI:

[ -λ, 1/2, 0 ]  
[1/2, -λ, 1/2 ]  
[ 0, 1/2, -λ ]

Compute determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/2)(1/2) ] - (1/2)[ (1/2)(-λ) - (1/2)(0) ] + 0  
= -λ(λ² - 1/4) - (1/2)( -λ/2 -0 )  
= -λ³ + (λ)/4 + (λ)/4  
= -λ³ + λ/2

Set to zero: -λ³ + λ/2=0 ⇒ λ( -λ² +1/2 )=0 ⇒ λ=0, λ=±sqrt(1/2)=±1/√2.

Thus, eigenvalues are 0, 1/√2, -1/√2.

So, probabilities can be computed as |⟨v|ψ⟩|².

But then, the probability is different.

But in the problem statement, the observable is P, not P'.

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused P with P'.

But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different basis.

Wait, for example, perhaps the system is in a basis where the state is different.

But without more information, I can't tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is expressed in a non-standard basis, but the problem didn't specify.

Given all this confusion, I think I'll have to go with my calculation.

I computed that the probability is 1/3, but the given correct answer is sqrt(2/3). I'm missing something here.

Wait, alternative approach: use the orthonormal basis.

Compute the probability as the sum over the orthonormal basis states' projections.

But no, that's similar to what I did before.

Wait, hold on. Maybe the observable is a two-level system, but the matrix is 3x3. So, perhaps the state is in a two-dimensional subspace, but the matrix is 3x3.

But no, the state is in 3D space.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the system is in a superposition of two eigenstates.

For example, the state ψ can be expressed as a combination of |v0⟩, |v1⟩, |v-1⟩.

Then, the probability of measuring 0 is | coefficient of |v0⟩ |².

So, let me compute ψ in terms of the eigenvectors.

Let me denote |v0⟩ = (1/√2)[1,0,-1]^T  
|v1⟩ = (1/√2)[1,√2,1]^T  
|v-1⟩ = (1/√2)[-1,√2,-1]^T

Express ψ = a|v0⟩ + b|v1⟩ + c|v-1⟩.

Compute the components:

ψ = a*(1/√2)[1,0,-1] + b*(1/√2)[1,√2,1] + c*(1/√2)[-1,√2,-1]

Compute the coefficients:

Component 1: a/√2 + b/√2 -c/√2  
Component 2: 0 + b√2 + c√2  
Component 3: -a/√2 + b/√2 -c/√2

So, system of equations:

1. (a + b - c)/√2 = -1  
2. (b + c√2 ) = 2  
3. (-a + b - c)/√2 =1

Let me write them:

Equation 1: a + b - c = -√2  
Equation 2: b + c√2 =2  
Equation 3: -a + b -c = √2

Now, let's add Equation 1 and Equation 3:

(a + b -c) + (-a + b -c )= -√2 + √2  
(0 + 2b -2c )=0  
Thus, 2b -2c =0 ⇒ b = c.

From Equation 2: b + c√2 =2  
But b =c, so c + c√2=2 ⇒ c(1 +√2)=2 ⇒ c=2/(1 +√2)

Rationalize denominator: c= 2(1 -√2)/[(1 +√2)(1 -√2)]=2(1 -√2)/(1 -2)=2(√2 -1 )

Similarly, since b =c, b=2(√2 -1 )

From Equation 1: a + b -c =-√2  
But since b =c, a +0= -√2 ⇒ a= -√2

Thus, the coefficients are:

a= -√2  
b=2(√2 -1 )  
c=2(√2 -1 )

Thus, ψ= a|v0⟩ +b|v1⟩ +c|v-1⟩.

Thus, the coefficient of |v0⟩ is a= -√2.

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is |a|²= (√2 )²=2.

But again, since ψ is not normalized, the probability is 2 / ||ψ||²=2/6=1/3.

Thus, again, 1/3.

But the problem's answer is sqrt(2/3).

Wait, unless the system is in a different state.

Wait, maybe the problem states that the system is in a state with elements (-1,2,1), but the observable is represented differently.

Wait, another thought: Maybe P is not the observable itself, but the measurement operator is different.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the measurement operator for an observable is a projection onto the eigenspace.

But if P is the observable, then the measurement operator is P itself, but that's not correct.

In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, say H. Then, the measurement operator is a projection onto the
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that a measurement of an observable yields 0 at a certain time t. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's our system's state vector, which I can denote as |ψ(t)⟩. It looks like it's a 3-dimensional vector. Let me write that down:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ -1 ]ᵀ
          [  2  ]ᵀ
          [  1  ]ᵀ

So, that's a column vector with three components. Now, the observable of the system is represented by a matrix operator P. The matrix P has specific elements given in the problem. Let me write out the matrix P based on the description.

The first row of P is (0, 1/√2, 0). The second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). So, P is:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Alright, so P is a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables are Hermitian (symmetric) operators in quantum mechanics. That makes sense.

Now, the observable P is going to be measured, and we want the probability that the measurement yields 0. In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the norm of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace.

So, the process is as follows:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.
2. Form the projection operator onto this eigenspace.
3. Project the state |ψ(t)⟩ onto this eigenspace to get the projection vector |φ⟩.
4. The probability is then the squared norm of |φ⟩.

Alternatively, another method is to compute the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto the null space of P (since the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the null space). That might be more straightforward.

Let me recall that for an observable (Hermitian operator) P, the probability of measuring 0 is equal to the squared norm of the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto the null space of P. The null space consists of all vectors |φ⟩ such that P|φ⟩ = 0.

So, my first task is to find the null space of P. That involves solving the equation P|φ⟩ = 0, where |φ⟩ is a column vector [φ₁; φ₂; φ₃]. Let me write out the equation P|φ⟩ = 0.

So, let's compute P|φ⟩:

P|φ⟩ = [ [0, 1/√2, 0     ] [φ₁]   [0]
          [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] [φ₂] = [0]
          [0, 1/√2, 0     ] [φ₃]   [0] ]

Wait, that can't be right. If P is applied to |φ⟩, the result is a vector where each component is the sum of products. Let me compute each component.

First component: 0*φ₁ + (1/√2)*φ₂ + 0*φ₃ = (1/√2)φ₂

Second component: (1/√2)φ₁ + 0*φ₂ + (1/√2)φ₃ = (1/√2)(φ₁ + φ₃)

Third component: 0*φ₁ + (1/√2)φ₂ + 0*φ₃ = (1/√2)φ₂

So, setting P|φ⟩ = 0 gives the system of equations:

(1/√2)φ₂ = 0  --> Equation 1

(1/√2)(φ₁ + φ₃) = 0 --> Equation 2

(1/√2)φ₂ = 0 --> Equation 3

Wait, Equations 1 and 3 are the same. So, effectively, we have two equations:

1. φ₂ = 0

2. φ₁ + φ₃ = 0

So, from equation 1, φ₂ must be zero. Then, from equation 2, φ₁ = -φ₃.

Thus, the null space of P is all vectors of the form [φ₁, 0, -φ₁]ᵀ, where φ₁ is any scalar. So, it's a one-dimensional null space spanned by the vector [1, 0, -1]ᵀ. Wait, is that right?

Wait, let's check. Let me take [1, 0, -1]ᵀ and multiply by P:

P[1; 0; -1] = [0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1); (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1); 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1)]

Compute each component:

First component: (1/√2)*0 = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + (1/√2)*(-1) = 0

Third component: (1/√2)*0 = 0

So, yes, P|φ⟩ = 0 for |φ⟩ = [1; 0; -1]ᵀ.

Similarly, any scalar multiple of this vector will also be in the null space.

Therefore, the null space is one-dimensional, spanned by [1; 0; -1]ᵀ.

So, to find the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto this null space, we can use the formula for projection onto a subspace. The projection operator is given by:

P_null = (|φ⟩⟨φ|) / (⟨φ|φ⟩)

So, first, let's compute |φ⟩, which is [1; 0; -1]ᵀ. Then, ⟨φ| is [1, 0, -1].

Compute ⟨φ|φ⟩: 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So, the projection operator P_null is:

( [1; 0; -1] [1, 0, -1] ) / 2

Compute the numerator matrix:

[1*1, 1*0, 1*(-1)] = [1, 0, -1]

[0*1, 0*0, 0*(-1)] = [0, 0, 0]

[-1*1, -1*0, -1*(-1)] = [-1, 0, 1]

So, the numerator matrix is:

[1, 0, -1]

[0, 0, 0]

[-1, 0, 1]

Now, divide each element by 2:

P_null = (1/2)[1, 0, -1;

              0, 0, 0;

              -1, 0, 1]

Now, we need to compute the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto this operator. So, let's compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩.

First, let's write |ψ(t)⟩ again:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ -1 ]ᵀ

          [  2  ]ᵀ

          [  1  ]ᵀ

So, let's perform matrix multiplication P_null |ψ(t)⟩.

Compute each component:

First component:

(1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (1/2)(-2) = -1

Second component:

(1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = same as first component, which is -1

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that.

Wait, no. Wait, the second row of P_null is all zeros except for the third element? No, wait, actually, looking back, P_null is:

[1/2, 0, -1/2 ]

[0, 0, 0]

[-1/2, 0, 1/2]

So, each row corresponds to the rows of the numerator matrix scaled by 1/2.

So, let's do it step by step.

First component:

(1/2)*1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = -1

Second component:

(1/2)*1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)*1 = same as above, which is (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = -1

Wait, hold on, no. That seems incorrect.

Wait, no. P_null is:

First row: [1/2, 0, -1/2]

Second row: [0, 0, 0]

Third row: [-1/2, 0, 1/2]

So, to compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩, it's a matrix multiplication:

[1/2, 0, -1/2]   [-1]   = (1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = -1

[0, 0, 0]         [2]     = 0* anything = 0

[-1/2, 0, 1/2]   [1]     = (-1/2)*1 + 0*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 0

So, the result is:

P_null |ψ(t)⟩ = [ -1 ]ᵀ

               [ 0  ]ᵀ

               [ 0  ]ᵀ

Wait, that's interesting. So, the projection is [ -1; 0; 0 ]ᵀ.

But wait, that seems a bit odd because the projection should be onto the null space. Let me compute the norm of this projection vector.

Compute the squared norm: (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1.

So, the norm is 1. Thus, the probability is 1^2 = 1?

But wait, the given correct answer is sqrt(2/3). That's about 0.816. Hmm, that contradicts what I just got.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the projection operator.

Let me double-check the projection operator.

The projection onto the null space is given by (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/(|φ|²).

We have |φ⟩ = [1; 0; -1], so |φ|² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Thus, the projection operator is:

(1/2)[1, 0, -1;

       0, 0, 0;

       -1, 0, 1]

So, that's correct. Then, when we multiply this with |ψ(t)⟩ = [-1; 2; 1], we get:

First component: (1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = (1/2)(-2) = -1

Second component: 0*anything = 0

Third component: (1/2)(-1*1 + 0*2 + 1*(-1)) = Wait, hold on, no.

Wait, actually, the third row is [-1/2, 0, 1/2]. So, third component is (-1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)*1 = (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1.

Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 0, but that was a miscalculation.

Wait, let's redo the multiplication step by step.

P_null is:

Row 1: [1/2, 0, -1/2]

Row 2: [0, 0, 0]

Row 3: [-1/2, 0, 1/2]

Multiply by |ψ(t)⟩ = [-1; 2; 1]

Compute each component:

First component: (1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) = -1

Second component: 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0

Third component: (-1/2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)*1 = (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1

So, the result is [-1; 0; 1]. So, P_null |ψ(t)⟩ = [-1; 0; 1].

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, the projection is [-1; 0; 1].

Compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 0^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So, the norm is sqrt(2), so the probability is (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2))² = 1? That can't be. Wait, no.

Wait, probability is the squared norm of the projection, which is (sqrt(2))² = 2. Wait, that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake in the projection.

Wait, let's go back.

We have |φ⟩ = [1; 0; -1]. The projection onto |φ⟩ is (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/(|φ|²). So, |φ⟩⟨φ| is a rank-1 matrix, and P_null is that divided by |φ|², which is 2.

So, P_null is (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/2. Then, when we compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩, we get a vector whose norm squared is equal to the probability.

But in my calculation, P_null |ψ(t)⟩ is [-1; 0; 1], whose norm squared is 2. So, the squared norm is 2, which would mean the probability is 2? That can't be. That suggests an error.

Wait a second, maybe I'm not computing the projection correctly. Because in quantum mechanics, the projection onto an eigenspace is given by (|e⟩⟨e|)/(|e⟩⟨e|), which is an idempotent operator, but perhaps I'm confusing the projection operator with the projection of the vector.

Let me recall that the projection of |ψ⟩ onto |φ⟩ is given by (⟨φ|ψ⟩) |φ⟩, which is a scalar times |φ⟩. So, perhaps I need to compute ⟨φ|ψ(t)⟩ and then multiply by |φ⟩.

Let me try that.

Compute ⟨φ|ψ(t)⟩ = [1, 0, -1] [ -1; 2; 1 ] = 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

So, the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto |φ⟩ is (-2) |φ⟩ = (-2)[1; 0; -1] = [-2; 0; 2].

Then, the squared norm of this projection is (-2)^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 0 + 4 = 8.

So, the probability is 8 / (something), but wait, wait, no.

Wait, the norm of the projection is sqrt(8) = 2√2, so the probability is (2√2)^2 = 8? That can't be.

Wait, that's not correct. No, the probability is the squared norm of the projection operator applied to |ψ⟩, which is the squared norm of the projection vector.

But wait, if I compute the projection of |ψ⟩ onto |φ⟩, which is (-2)|φ⟩, then the squared norm is ||(-2)|φ⟩||² = 4 |||φ||².

But ||φ||² is 2, as we computed earlier, so the squared norm is 4*2 = 8? That seems high.

Wait, but |φ⟩ is normalized? No, |φ⟩ is not normalized. It's just an eigenvector. So, its norm is sqrt(2). So, if we have the projection vector as (-2)|φ⟩, then the squared norm is ||(-2)|φ⟩||² = (4)*||φ||² = 4*2 = 8.

But that can't be, because probabilities can't be more than 1, and 8 is way too big.

Wait, this suggests that either my approach is wrong or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should go back and use another method.

Alternatively, the probability can be computed using the formula:

P(0) = (⟨ψ(t)| P^2 |ψ(t)⟩) / (⟨ψ(t)| P |ψ(t)⟩ )

But wait, no. Actually, the probability is ⟨ψ(t)| P^2 |ψ(t)⟩ / ⟨ψ(t)| P |ψ(t)⟩.

Wait, but P is an observable, so it's Hermitian, so P^2 is also Hermitian, and the eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the right formula. Let me think.

Actually, if P is an observable, then the probability of measuring eigenvalue λ is given by the spectral decomposition:

P = Σ λ_n |λ_n⟩⟨λ_n|

Then, the probability is Σ |⟨λ_n | ψ(t) ⟩|².

But since we are interested in the probability of measuring 0, we need the sum over all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P.

Alternatively, since P is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real, and it has a spectral decomposition.

But perhaps the easier way is to compute the eigenvalues of P and see which one corresponds to 0.

Wait, but we already computed the null space, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue with eigenvector |φ⟩ = [1; 0; -1]ᵀ.

But P has other eigenvalues as well.

Alternatively, maybe P has another eigenvalue. Let's compute the trace and determinant to check.

The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

The trace is the sum of eigenvalues. So, sum of eigenvalues is 0.

The determinant of P can be computed as follows:

P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Let me compute the determinant of P.

Since the matrix is symmetric, maybe we can diagonalize it or find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, let's note the structure of P. It's a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal, 1/√2 on the off-diagonal positions that form a sort of "ring". It's actually a specific kind of matrix known as a "ring matrix" or "circular matrix".

The eigenvalues of such a matrix can be found by considering it as a graph Laplacian or by using properties of circulant matrices, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's note that the matrix P can be written as (1/√2)(σ_x + σ_y), where σ_x and σ_y are the Pauli matrices. Because in the first and third basis, it's 0, and the off-diagonal elements are 1/√2.

Wait, let me check:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But in our case, the matrix has 1/√2 in positions (1,2) and (2,3) and (2,1) and (3,2), but all diagonal elements are 0.

Wait, actually, if I consider σ_x + σ_y, it would be:

σ_x + σ_y = [[0,1],[1,0]] + [[0,-i],[i,0]] = [[0,1 - i], [1 + i, 0]]

But that's not exactly our P. Because our P has 1/√2 in the off-diagonal positions.

So, perhaps P is proportional to σ_x + σ_y, scaled by 1/√2.

Indeed, if I take (σ_x + σ_y)/√2, it would be:

[[0, 1/√2], [1/√2, 0]]

But our matrix P has 1/√2 in positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). So, it's more like a shifted version.

Wait, actually, P is a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/√2 on the super and subdiagonal and the (1,3) and (3,1) positions.

Wait, but in our case, P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 0, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 0]

So, it's not exactly the standard circulant matrix, but it has a specific structure.

Alternatively, let me try to find the eigenvalues by considering it as a tridiagonal matrix with zero diagonal and 1/√2 on the off-diagonal.

Wait, no, it's not tridiagonal because the (1,3) and (3,1) elements are also 1/√2.

So, it's a pentadiagonal matrix? No, in 3x3, it's fully connected except diagonals.

Alternatively, maybe we can use symmetry to find the eigenvalues.

We know that one eigenvalue is 0, with eigenvector [1; 0; -1].

What about the others?

Let me consider the vector [1; 1; 1]. Let's compute P|v⟩:

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*1 = 1/√2

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*1 + 1/√2*1 = 2/√2 = √2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*1 = 1/√2

So, P|v⟩ = [1/√2; √2; 1/√2]

Now, compute the norm squared:

(1/√2)^2 + (√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 2 + (1/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3

So, P|v⟩ has norm squared 3. If |v⟩ is an eigenvector, then P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩.

But in this case, P|v⟩ is not a scalar multiple of |v⟩, so |v⟩ is not an eigenvector.

Wait, maybe [1; -1; 0].

Compute P|w⟩ where |w⟩ = [1; -1; 0].

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-1) + 0*0 = -1/√2

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*(-1) + 1/√2*0 = 1/√2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-1) + 0*0 = -1/√2

So, P|w⟩ = [-1/√2; 1/√2; -1/√2]. Let's compute the norm squared:

( (-1/√2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/√2)^2 ) = (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) = 3/2.

Again, not a multiple of |w⟩, so not an eigenvalue.

Hmm, maybe another approach.

Since P is symmetric, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix, and all eigenvalues are real.

We have one eigenvalue already, which is 0.

Let me compute the trace, which is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

We have another eigenvalue, perhaps 2? Let me check.

Suppose λ is an eigenvalue, and |u⟩ is the eigenvector. Then, P|u⟩ = λ|u⟩.

Assuming that, let's suppose that P has eigenvalues 0, 2, -2.

Wait, because the trace is 0, so 0 + 2 + (-2) = 0.

Let me see if that makes sense.

If eigenvalues are 0, 2, -2.

Let me check for λ = 2.

Suppose P|u⟩ = 2|u⟩.

Then, let's assume |u⟩ = [a; b; c]

So, we have the equations:

0*a + (1/√2)b + 0*c = 2a

(1/√2)a + 0*b + (1/√2)c = 2b

0*a + (1/√2)b + 0*c = 2c

So, from the first equation:

(1/√2)b = 2a --> b = 2√2 a

From the third equation:

(1/√2)b = 2c --> b = 2√2 c

Therefore, from first and third equations:

2√2 a = 2√2 c --> a = c

From the second equation:

(1/√2)a + (1/√2)c = 2b

But since a = c,

(2/√2)a = 2b --> √2 a = 2b

But we know b = 2√2 a, so substituting:

√2 a = 2*(2√2 a) = 4√2 a

Divide both sides by √2 a (assuming a ≠ 0):

1 = 4

Wait, that can't be. So, that suggests no solution unless a = 0, which would make b = 0 and c = 0, giving trivial solution.

So, no eigenvector for λ = 2.

Hmm, maybe λ = 1? Let me try.

Assume λ = 1.

Then, the equations are:

(1/√2)b = a

(1/√2)(a + c) = b

(1/√2)b = c

From first equation: b = √2 a

From third equation: c = √2 a

From second equation: (1/√2)(a + √2 a) = √2 a

Simplify:

(1/√2)(a + √2 a) = √2 a

=>

(1/√2)( (1 + √2)a ) = √2 a

Multiply both sides by √2:

( (1 + √2)a ) = 2 a

So,

(1 + √2)a = 2a

Subtract 2a:

(1 + √2 - 2)a = 0

(√2 -1)a = 0

So, a = 0 or √2 -1 = 0, which isn't true. So, a = 0, so b = 0, c = 0. Again, trivial.

Hmm, maybe I should use another method.

Alternatively, maybe eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but since trace is 0, perhaps other values.

Alternatively, compute the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Compute determinant:

| -λ    1/√2      0     |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2  |
| 0     1/√2   -λ     |

Compute determinant:

-λ * det( [-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ] ) - 1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ]) + 0 * det(...)

So,

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - 1/√2 [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0

Simplify:

-λ [ λ² - 1/2 ] - 1/√2 [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ]

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 - ( -λ / 2 )

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ

Set equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = ±1.

So, eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So, P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So, to find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ = 0, which is one-dimensional as we found earlier.

So, the projection operator onto λ=0 is P_null.

We computed that as:

P_null = (1/2)[1, 0, -1;

              0, 0, 0;

              -1, 0, 1]

Then, we need to compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩.

Wait, earlier I thought P_null |ψ(t)⟩ was [ -1; 0; 1 ], which had squared norm 2.

But that can't be because the projection should be onto a vector of norm sqrt(2), so the probability would be ( ||P_null |ψ(t)⟩ ||² ) / ( || |ψ(t)⟩ ||² )

Wait, wait, no. Actually, the projection onto the eigenspace is a vector, whose squared norm is the probability.

But the squared norm is ( ||P_null |ψ(t)⟩ ||² ) / ( || |ψ(t)⟩ ||² )

Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, the probability is ||P_null |ψ(t)⟩ ||², because P_null is the projection onto the eigenspace, so the squared norm of the projection is the probability.

But let's compute || |ψ(t) ⟩ ||².

|ψ(t)⟩ is [ -1; 2; 1 ], so its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So, the norm squared is 6.

Earlier, we computed P_null |ψ(t)⟩ as [ -1; 0; 1 ], whose norm squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2.

Thus, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, which is not sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816.

Hmm, that's conflicting with the given correct answer.

Wait, perhaps my projection operator is wrong.

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, correct?

We have the eigenvectors:

For λ=0: [1; 0; -1]

For λ=1: Let me compute it.

Assume P|u⟩ = |u⟩.

So, equations:

(1/√2) u₂ = u₁

(1/√2)(u₁ + u₃) = u₂

(1/√2) u₂ = u₃

From equations 1 and 3:

u₂ = √2 u₁

u₃ = √2 u₁

From equation 2:

(1/√2)(u₁ + √2 u₁) = √2 u₁

Simplify:

(1/√2)(1 + √2)u₁ = √2 u₁

Multiply both sides by √2:

(1 + √2)u₁ = 2 u₁

So,

(1 + √2 - 2)u₁ = 0

(√2 -1)u₁ = 0

Thus, u₁ = 0, so u₂ = 0, u₃ = 0. Which is trivial.

Wait, that can't be. So, maybe λ=1 is not an eigenvalue?

Wait, earlier, when we computed the characteristic equation, we had eigenvalues λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

But in practice, we can't find a non-trivial eigenvector for λ=1. That suggests that perhaps λ=1 is a degenerate eigenvalue?

Wait, no, the characteristic equation was -λ³ + λ = 0, which factors as λ(λ² -1)=0, so eigenvalues 0,1,-1. So, it's not degenerate. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try to compute the eigenvectors for λ=1 again.

We have:

(1/√2) u₂ = u₁ --> u₂ = √2 u₁

(1/√2)(u₁ + u₃) = u₂ --> (u₁ + u₃)/√2 = u₂ = √2 u₁

So, (u₁ + u₃) = 2 u₁ --> u₃ = u₁

From the third equation:

(1/√2) u₂ = u₃ --> u₂ = √2 u₃ = √2 u₁

So, consistent.

Thus, eigenvectors are of the form [u₁; √2 u₁; u₁], which can be normalized.

Similarly, for λ=-1:

P|u⟩ = -|u⟩

So,

(1/√2) u₂ = -u₁

(1/√2)(u₁ + u₃) = -u₂

(1/√2) u₂ = -u₃

From equation 1: u₂ = -√2 u₁

From equation 3: u₂ = -√2 u₃ --> u₃ = -u₁

From equation 2:

(1/√2)(u₁ + u₃) = -u₂

Substitute u₃ = -u₁ and u₂ = -√2 u₁:

(1/√2)(u₁ - u₁) = -(-√2 u₁)

(1/√2)(0) = √2 u₁

0 = √2 u₁ --> u₁ = 0 --> u₂ = 0, u₃ = 0. Again, trivial.

So, only non-trivial eigenvector is for λ=0.

Wait, that can't be. Because the trace is zero, and sum of eigenvalues is zero, so it's 0,1,-1.

But only for λ=0, we have non-trivial eigenvector.

But according to our earlier characteristic equation, eigenvalues are 0,1,-1, so they should all have non-trivial eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the characteristic equation.

Wait, let's compute determinant again:

| -λ    1/√2      0     |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2  |
| 0     1/√2   -λ     |

Compute determinant:

-λ * det( [-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ] ) - 1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ]) + 0 * det(...)

First minor: det( [ -λ, 1/√2 ; 1/√2, -λ ] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2

Second minor: det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ] ) = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

So, determinant:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) - 1/√2*(-λ/√2) + 0

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

= -λ³ + λ

So, correct.

Hence, eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

Hmm, then perhaps for λ=1, eigenvectors can be found in another way.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's take a vector that is orthogonal to [1; 0; -1], since we know that's the eigenvector for λ=0.

Let me take |v⟩ = [1; 1; 0]. Compute P|v⟩:

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*0 = 1/√2

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*1 + 1/√2*0 = 1/√2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*0 = 1/√2

So, P|v⟩ = [1/√2; 1/√2; 1/√2]

Compute the norm squared: 3*(1/√2)^2 = 3/2.

Compute the ratio (P|v⟩) • |v⟩ / |||v||².

Dot product: [1/√2; 1/√2; 1/√2] • [1; 1; 0] = 1/√2 + 1/√2 + 0 = 2/√2 = √2

|||v||² = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

Thus, the ratio is √2 / 2 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707, which is less than 1, so it's not an eigenvalue.

Wait, if λ=1 is an eigenvalue, then P|v⟩ should be |v⟩ scaled by 1. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different vector.

Wait, take |w⟩ = [1; -1; 0]

Compute P|w⟩:

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-1) + 0*0 = -1/√2

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*(-1) + 1/√2*0 = 1/√2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-1) + 0*0 = -1/√2

So, P|w⟩ = [ -1/√2; 1/√2; -1/√2 ]

Compute ||P|w⟩||²: 3*(1/2) = 3/2

Compute |||w||²: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

Compute (P|w⟩) • |w⟩:

[ -1/√2; 1/√2; -1/√2 ] • [1; -1; 0] = (-1/√2)*1 + (1/√2)*(-1) + (-1/√2)*0 = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = -2/√2 = -√2

So, the ratio is (-√2)/2 = -1/√2 ≈ -0.707, not equal to 1.

Thus, again, not an eigenvalue.

Wait, so this is confusing because the characteristic equation suggests that 1 is an eigenvalue, but we can't find a non-trivial eigenvector.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Let me recompute the determinant.

Compute det(P - λ I):

| -λ    1/√2      0     |
|1/√2  -λ     1/√2  |
| 0     1/√2   -λ     |

Compute using expansion along the first row:

-λ * det( [-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ] ) - 1/√2 * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ] ) + 0 * det(...)

First minor: det( [-λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ] ) = λ² - (1/2)

Second minor: det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ] ) = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

So,

det = -λ*(λ² - 1/2) - 1/√2*(-λ/√2) + 0

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

= -λ³ + λ

So, yes, eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

Wait, but why can't we find eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1?

Wait, maybe because I'm choosing specific vectors that are orthogonal to [1;0;-1], but perhaps the eigenvectors are not in those directions.

Wait, let me try to find eigenvectors for λ=1.

So, (P - I)|u⟩ = 0

So, equations:

(-1 - 0)u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ + 0*u₃ = 0 --> -u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ = 0 --> u₂ = √2 u₁

(1/√2)u₁ + (-1 - 0)u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ = 0 --> (1/√2)u₁ - u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ = 0

0*u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ + (-1 - 0)u₃ = 0 --> (1/√2)u₂ - u₃ = 0 --> u₃ = (1/√2)u₂

From first equation, u₂ = √2 u₁. From third equation, u₃ = (1/√2)u₂ = (1/√2)(√2 u₁) = u₁.

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)u₁ - u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ = (1/√2)u₁ - √2 u₁ + (1/√2)u₁ = [ (1/√2 + 1/√2)u₁ ] - √2 u₁ = (√2)u₁ - √2 u₁ = 0

So, it's satisfied.

Thus, eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form [u₁; √2 u₁; u₁]. Let's take u₁=1, then u₂=√2, u₃=1.

So, |u⟩ = [1; √2; 1]. Let's normalize it.

Compute ||u||²: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, normalized eigenvector is [1/2; √2/2; 1/2].

Similarly, for λ=-1, we have:

(P + I)|u⟩ = 0

Thus,

(1)u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ + 0*u₃ = 0 --> u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ = 0 --> u₁ = - (1/√2) u₂

(1/√2)u₁ + (-1)u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ = 0

0*u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ + (-1)u₃ = 0 --> (1/√2)u₂ - u₃ = 0 --> u₃ = (1/√2)u₂

From first equation, u₁ = - (1/√2) u₂

From third equation, u₃ = (1/√2) u₂

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)u₁ - u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ = (1/√2)(-1/√2 u₂) - u₂ + (1/√2)(1/√2 u₂ )

Simplify:

= (-1/2) u₂ - u₂ + (1/2) u₂ = (-1/2 -1 +1/2) u₂ = (-1) u₂ = 0

Thus, u₂ = 0, leading to u₁ = 0, u₃ = 0. So, only trivial solution.

Wait, that's not possible. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect for λ=-1.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe for λ=-1, the eigenvectors are similar.

Wait, perhaps flipping signs.

Let me take |u⟩ = [1; -√2; 1]. Let's compute P|u⟩.

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-√2) + 0*1 = (-1)

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*(-√2) + 1/√2*1 = (2)/√2 = √2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*(-√2) + 0*1 = (-1)

So, P|u⟩ = [ -1; √2; -1 ].

Compute (P + I)|u⟩:

[ -1 +1; √2 +0; -1 +1 ] = [0; √2; 0]

Which is not zero. So, not an eigenvector.

Wait, another approach. Let me take |u⟩ = [a; b; c] and solve (P + I)|u⟩ = 0.

Thus:

(1)a + (1/√2)b = 0 --> a + (1/√2)b = 0 --> a = - (1/√2) b

(1/√2)a + (-1)b + (1/√2)c = 0

(1/√2)b + (-1)c = 0 --> c = (1/√2) b

Substitute a = - (1/√2) b into second equation:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 b) - b + (1/√2)c = (-1/2)b - b + (1/√2)c = (-3/2)b + (1/√2)c = 0

But c = (1/√2) b, so substitute:

(-3/2)b + (1/√2)(1/√2 b ) = (-3/2 + 1/2 ) b = (-1)b = 0 --> b =0

Thus, a =0, c=0. Trivial solution.

Hmm, so for λ=-1, we only get the trivial solution. But according to characteristic equation, it's a valid eigenvalue. So, maybe it's a defective eigenvalue?

Wait, but in that case, the matrix is not diagonalizable, but since P is symmetric, it should be diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Maybe for λ=-1, we can take a different vector.

Wait, perhaps |u⟩ = [1; 1; -2]

Compute P|u⟩:

First component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*(-2) = 1/√2

Second component: 1/√2*1 + 0*1 + 1/√2*(-2) = 1/√2 - 2/√2 = (-1)/√2

Third component: 0*1 + 1/√2*1 + 0*(-2) = 1/√2

Thus, P|u⟩ = [1/√2; -1/√2; 1/√2]

Compute (P + I)|u⟩:

[1/√2 +1; -1/√2 +0; 1/√2 +1 ]

= [1 + 1/√2; -1/√2; 1 + 1/√2 ]

Not zero. So, not an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps |u⟩ = [1; 1; 1]. Wait, we tried that earlier.

P|u⟩ = [1/√2; √2; 1/√2]

Which is not a scalar multiple of |u⟩.

Wait, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to accept that for λ=1 and λ=-1, eigenvectors might require more work.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix is not diagonalizable? But for symmetric matrices, they are always diagonalizable.

Wait, unless I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's try to compute the eigenvectors for λ=1 again.

We have (P - I)|u⟩ =0.

So,

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ] [u₁]   [0]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2] [u₂] = [0]

[ 0, 1/√2, -1 ] [u₃]   [0]

So, three equations:

- u₁ + (1/√2)u₂ = 0 --> u₂ = √2 u₁

(1/√2)u₁ - u₂ + (1/√2)u₃ =0

(1/√2)u₂ - u₃ =0 --> u₃ = (1/√2)u₂ = (1/√2)(√2 u₁) = u₁

Substitute u₂ and u₃ into second equation:

(1/√2)u₁ - √2 u₁ + (1/√2)u₁ = [ (1/√2 +1/√2 )u₁ ] - √2 u₁ = (√2)u₁ - √2 u₁ =0.

Thus, consistent.

So, eigenvectors are [u₁; √2 u₁; u₁]. So, with u₁=1, we get [1; √2; 1], which is the same as before.

Let's normalize this vector.

Compute ||u||² = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Thus, normalized eigenvector is [1/2; √2/2; 1/2].

Similarly, for λ=-1, eigenvectors would be orthogonal to [1;0;-1] and to [1; √2; 1].

Let me find an eigenvector for λ=-1 orthogonal to both.

Let me take |v⟩ = [1; 1; -2]

Check orthogonality:

Dot product with [1;0;-1]: 1*1 + 0*1 + (-1)*(-2) =1 + 0 +2=3 ≠0.

Not orthogonal.

Wait, perhaps I can use Gram-Schmidt.

We have two eigenvectors: [1;0;-1] and [1;√2;1].

Let me take another vector, say [1;1;0], subtract its projection onto the first two vectors.

Compute projection of [1;1;0] onto [1;0;-1]:

proj1 = [(1*1 + 0*1 + (-1)*0)/(1² +0 + (-1)²)] [1;0;-1] = [1/2][1;0;-1]

Similarly, projection onto [1;√2;1]:

proj2 = [(1*1 + √2*1 +1*0)/(1² + (√2)^2 +1^2 ) ] [1;√2;1] = [ (1 + √2)/ (1 + 2 +1) ] [1;√2;1 ] = [ (1 + √2)/4 ] [1;√2;1 ]

Compute (1 + √2)/4 ≈ (1 +1.414)/4 ≈ 0.6035.

Thus, the residual vector is:

[1;1;0] - proj1 - proj2

Compute each component:

First component: 1 - (1/2) - (1 + √2)/4

= (4/4 - 2/4 - (1 + √2)/4 ) = (2 -1 -√2)/4 = (1 - √2)/4 ≈ (1 -1.414)/4 ≈ -0.1035

Second component:1 - 0 - (1 + √2)/4

= (4/4 - (1 + √2)/4 ) = (3 - √2)/4 ≈ (3 -1.414)/4 ≈ 0.4855

Third component:0 - (-1/2) - (1 + √2)/4

= 1/2 - (1 + √2)/4

= (2/4 - (1 + √2)/4 ) = (1 - √2)/4 ≈ same as first component.

So, the residual vector is approximately [-0.1035; 0.4855; -0.1035].

Normalize this vector.

Compute its squared norm:

(-0.1035)^2 + (0.4855)^2 + (-0.1035)^2 ≈ 0.0107 + 0.2353 + 0.0107 ≈ 0.2567.

Approximate norm ≈ sqrt(0.2567) ≈ 0.5065.

Thus, normalized residual vector ≈ [-0.1035/0.5065; 0.4855/0.5065; -0.1035/0.5065] ≈ [-0.204; 0.958; -0.204].

Thus, [ -0.204; 0.958; -0.204 ] is an eigenvector for λ=-1.

So, now we have three orthogonal eigenvectors:

For λ=0: [1;0;-1] normalized: [1/√2; 0; -1/√2]

For λ=1: [1/2; √2/2; 1/2]

For λ=-1: approximately [-0.204; 0.958; -0.204]

So, with these eigenvectors, we can express the state |ψ(t)⟩ as a linear combination.

But since we're interested in the projection onto λ=0, which is the null space, we can use the projection operator.

But earlier, we found that the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto the null space is [-1;0;1], which had squared norm 2. But the norm of |ψ(t)⟩ is sqrt(6), so the probability would be 2/6 = 1/3.

But according to the user, the correct answer is sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816, which is about 6/7. Wait, 6/7 is approximately 0.857, but sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.816.

Wait, maybe the projection is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the projection operator.

Earlier, I computed P_null |ψ(t)⟩ as [-1; 0;1], but let me recompute that.

Given P_null is (1/2)[1,0,-1; 0,0,0; -1,0,1]

Compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩:

First component: (1/2)(1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = -1

Second component: 0

Third component: (1/2)(-1*1 + 0*2 +1*(-1)) = (1/2)(-1 -1) = -1

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, the third component is computed as:

(1/2)(-1*1 + 0*2 +1*(-1)) = (1/2)(-1 + 0 -1) = (-2)/2 = -1

So, the projection is [ -1; 0; -1 ].

Compute squared norm: (-1)^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2.

Thus, the probability is 2 / ||ψ||² = 2 / 6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

But the user says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the operator is not P, but P squared?

Wait, no, because the observable is P, and the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1. So, the probability is 2/6=1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the square of the operator or something else.

Wait, let me compute ||P|ψ(t)⟩||².

Compute P|ψ(t)⟩:

P|ψ(t)⟩ = [0, 1/√2,0; 1/√2,0,1/√2;0,1/√2,0] [ -1;2;1 ]

Compute component-wise:

First component: 0*(-1) + 1/√2*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

Second component: 1/√2*(-1) + 0*2 + 1/√2*1 = (-1 +1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + 1/√2*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

So, P|ψ(t)⟩ = [√2; 0; √2]

Compute squared norm: (√2)^2 + 0 + (√2)^2 = 2 + 0 +2=4.

Compute (P|ψ(t)⟩) • |ψ(t)⟩ = [√2*(-1) + 0*2 + √2*1 ] = (-√2 + √2 )=0.

So, the probability is 0? That can't be.

Wait, no, the probability of measuring λ is ||P|u⟩||² where |u⟩ is the projection onto the eigenspace.

But since for λ=0, the projection is [ -1;0;1 ] with squared norm 2, the probability is 2/6=1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the initial problem statement again.

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t."

Wait, no, I think I was right earlier.

But the user says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I have a mistake in the projection.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps P is the square root of another operator.

Wait, no, P is the observable, so to get the probability of 0, it's the projection onto the null space.

Wait, perhaps the null space is two-dimensional, but it's actually one-dimensional.

Wait, but from earlier, we have only one eigenvector for λ=0.

So, the null space is one-dimensional.

Wait, perhaps the projection is not just [ -1;0;1 ], but maybe scaled differently.

Wait, [ -1;0;1 ] has squared norm 2, while |ψ(t)⟩ has squared norm 6.

But sqrt(2/3) is equal to sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.816.

If the probability is sqrt(2/3), that's different from 1/3.

Wait, let me try another method.

Compute the projection onto the null space.

The null space is spanned by [1;0;-1], as we found.

The projection operator onto the null space is (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/(|φ|²).

Which is [1;0;-1][1 0 -1]/ (1² +0 + (-1)^2) = [1;0;-1][1 0 -1]/2.

So, the projection operator is (1/2)[1 0 -1; 0 0 0; -1 0 1].

Compute this operator times |ψ(t)⟩:

(1/2)[1 0 -1; 0 0 0; -1 0 1] [ -1;2;1 ].

First component: (1/2)(-1 +0 -1 )= (-2)/2 = -1

Second component: 0

Third component: (1/2)(-1 +0 -1 )= (-2)/2 = -1

So, the projection is [ -1; 0; -1 ], same as before.

Compute the squared norm: (-1)^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2.

Thus, the probability is 2 / ||ψ||² = 2/6=1/3.

Thus, 1/3 is the correct probability.

But the user says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.816, which is a valid probability less than 1.

Wait, unless the observable is actually P squared, but no, the problem says the observable is P.

Wait, unless the measurement is in a different basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different state at time t.

Wait, no, the state is given as (-1,2,1).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the null space.

Wait, suppose the null space is two-dimensional. Is that possible?

Wait, we have only one equation from P|φ⟩=0: φ₂=0, and φ₁ + φ₃=0.

Thus, the null space is one-dimensional, spanned by [1;0;-1].

Thus, the projection is indeed 2/6=1/3.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/3, not sqrt(2/3).

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is different.

Wait, no, the user gave P as:

First row: 0,1/√2,0

Second row:1/√2,0,1/√2

Third row:0,1/√2,0

Which is the same as I took.

Wait, so maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a different basis.

Wait, but the state is given as (-1,2,1), which is a column vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is the square of P, but the problem says P.

Wait, unless it's P transposed, but the matrix is symmetric, so transposing doesn't change it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the probability is || P |ψ(t) ⟩ ||^2?

But no, in quantum mechanics, the probability is || projection onto the eigenspace ||^2.

Wait, but || P |ψ(t) ⟩ ||^2 is equal to the sum of squares of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probability of measuring each eigenvalue.

But in this case, if the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1, then:

|| P |ψ(t) ⟩ ||^2 = 0² * p_0 + 1² * p_1 + (-1)^2 * p_-1

Which is 0 + p_1 + p_-1.

But we have p_0 + p_1 + p_-1 =1.

But since p_0=1/3, then p_1 + p_-1 = 2/3.

Thus, || P |ψ(t) ||^2=2/3≈0.666.

But the user says the answer is sqrt(2/3)≈0.816.

Wait, no, that's not the probability. The probability is p_0=1/3≈0.333.

Wait, maybe the observable is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says the state at time t is (-1,2,1). So, that's a column vector.

The observable is P, with first row 0,1/√2,0; second row 1/√2,0,1/√2; third row 0,1/√2,0.

So, P is a 3x3 symmetric matrix.

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors correctly, then project.

But as we saw, the projection onto the null space gives 1/3.

Hmm, but since the user says the correct answer is sqrt(2/3), perhaps I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let's try to compute the projection differently.

Compute the projection of |ψ(t)⟩ onto the null space.

The projection operator is (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/||φ||² where |φ⟩ is [1;0;-1].

So, |φ⟩⟨φ| is:

[1 0 -1]

[0 0 0]

[-1 0 1]

Divide by ||φ||²=2, so:

P_null = (1/2)[1 0 -1;

              0 0 0;

              -1 0 1]

Compute P_null |ψ(t)⟩:

First component: (1/2)(1*(-1) +0*2 + (-1)*1 )= (1/2)(-1 -1)= -1

Second component: 0

Third component: (1/2)(-1*1 +0*2 +1*(-1))= (1/2)(-1 -1)= -1

So, projection is [ -1;0; -1 ].

Compute its norm squared: 1 +0 +1=2.

Thus, probability is 2 / ||ψ||²=2/6=1/3.

Thus, 1/3 is the correct probability.

But user says it's sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is P squared.

Wait, compute P^2.

Let me compute P squared.

P is:

[0, 1/√2,0;

1/√2,0,1/√2;

0,1/√2,0]

So, P^2 is P multiplied by P.

Compute each component:

First row:

(0*0 + 1/√2*1/√2 +0*0, 0*1/√2 +1/√2*0 +0*1/√2, 0*0 +1/√2*1/√2 +0*0 )

= (1/2, 0, 1/2)

Second row:

(1/√2*0 +0*1/√2 +1/√2*0, 1/√2*1/√2 +0*0 +1/√2*1/√2, 1/√2*0 +0*1/√2 +1/√2*0 )

= (0, 2*(1/2)=1, 0)

Third row:

(0*0 +1/√2*1/√2 +0*0, 0*1/√2 +1/√2*0 +0*1/√2, 0*0 +1/√2*1/√2 +0*0 )

= (1/2, 0,1/2 )

So, P^2 is:

[1/2, 0,1/2;

0,1,0;

1/2,0,1/2]

Compute the eigenvalues of P^2:

It's a 3x3 matrix with 1/2 on the diagonals except the middle, which is 1.

So, the characteristic equation is |P^2 - λ I|=0.

Compute determinant:

| -1/2    0     1/2 |

| 0      1-λ    0   | = [ (-1/2)((1-λ)(1/2) -0 ) -0 + (1/2)(0 -0 ) ] = (-1/2)( (1-λ)(1/2) ) = (-1/2)(1/2 - λ/2 ) = (-1/4 + λ/4 )

|1/2      0     -1/2 |

Wait, no, the determinant is:

(-1/2)[ (1 - λ)(-1/2) - 0 ] - 0 + (1/2)[ 0 -0 ]

= (-1/2)( (1 - λ)(-1/2) ) = (-1/2)( -1/2 + λ/2 ) = (1/4 - λ/4 )

Set equal to zero: 1/4 - λ/4=0 --> λ=1.

So, P^2 has eigenvalue 1 with eigenvectors.

But that's not helpful because the user is talking about P, not P squared.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is related to P squared?

But no, the observable is P, so the probability is 1/3.

Wait, perhaps the system is in a different basis, so the state is expressed differently.

But in the problem, the state is given as a column vector, so the basis is standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a vector in the basis of the null space, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, no, the state is given as (-1,2,1), which is a vector in the standard basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the answer is 1/3, not sqrt(2/3).

Alternatively, I might be missing something.

Wait, sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.816, which is close to sqrt(2)/sqrt(3).

If the projection is [ -1;0;1 ], then this vector is not normalized. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )=sqrt(2).

So, the projection vector is [ -1;0;1 ] / sqrt(2).

Thus, the squared norm is 2 / 2 =1.

But that would mean the probability is 1, which is not the case.

Wait, no.

Wait, the projection operator is (|φ⟩⟨φ|)/||φ||², which is [1;0;-1][1 0 -1]/2.

So, when you apply this operator to |ψ(t)⟩, you get [ -1;0;-1 ].

The squared norm of this is 2, but the norm of |ψ(t)⟩ is sqrt(6).

So, the probability is 2 / 6=1/3.

Thus, 1/3 is correct.

Hence, the answer should be 1/3, but the user says sqrt(2/3). So, perhaps the user is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is different.

Wait, unless the observable is the Pauli z matrix or something else, but in the problem, it's given as P.

Wait, unless I misread the question, which says:

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t."

Yes, so it's the matrix P as given, with elements as above.

Thus, unless the observable is the square of P, but the question says P.

Thus, I think 1/3 is correct.

Hence, the user might have a mistake in their answer, or I might have missed something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not in the standard basis.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector, so it's in the standard basis.

Thus, I think the correct answer is 1/3, not sqrt(2/3).

But the user says sqrt(2/3). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is 2/3, but that's also not sqrt(2/3).

Wait, sqrt(2/3)= approximately 0.816.

Wait, unless the projection is [ -1;0;1 ] / sqrt(2), then squared norm is 2/2=1, but that can't be because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the projection in another way.

Wait, using the inner product.

The projection scalar is ⟨φ|ψ(t)⟩ = [1,0,-1] [ -1;2;1 ] = -1 -2 +1= -2.

Thus, the projection vector is (-2)|φ⟩= (-2)[1;0;-1]= [-2;0;2].

Compute squared norm: 4 +0 +4=8.

Thus, the probability is 8 / ||ψ||²=8 /6=4/3≈1.333, which is greater than 1. Impossible.

Wait, no, probability is || projection ||² / ||ψ||².

Wait, || projection ||²= (||φ||² * |⟨φ|ψ⟩|² ) / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, the projection is (⟨φ|ψ⟩) |φ⟩, so norm squared is |⟨φ|ψ⟩|² ||φ||² / ||ψ||².

So, probability
