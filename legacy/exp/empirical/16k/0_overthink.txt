[overthinking]
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, John buys 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. Hmm, each large bag is 10 ounces. I need to find out how many small bags he can make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. Also, it says that an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first, but I think I can break it down.

First, let me just write down the key points:

- John buys 3 large bags.
- Each large bag is 10 ounces.
- Each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M.
- He wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag.

And the question is: How many small bags can he make?

Alright, so let's see. He has 3 large bags, each 10 ounces. So, the total weight he has is 3 bags times 10 ounces each, which is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. Got that.

Now, each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it. So, to find the total number of M&M he has, I need to multiply the total weight by 30. So, 30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce. Let me calculate that: 30 * 30 = 900. So, he has 900 M&M in total.

He wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. So, to find the number of small bags, I need to divide the total number of M&M by the number he puts in each small bag. That would be 900 / 10. Let me do that division: 900 divided by 10 is 90. So, he can make 90 small bags.

Wait, but the user mentioned that the correct answer is 45. Hmm, so I must have missed something here. Let me go back through the problem again.

John buys 3 large bags, each 10 ounces. Each large bag would be 10 ounces, so 3 large bags are 30 ounces total. Each ounce has 30 M&M, so 30 ounces * 30 M&M = 900 M&M total.

He puts 10 M&M in each small bag. So, 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.

Wait, that's conflicting with the given correct answer of 45. Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "if he puts 10 in each small bag." Hmm, he's putting 10 M&M in each small bag. So, 900 / 10 = 90. Hmm. Maybe the confusion is between ounces and M&M? Or perhaps, does each large bag have 10 ounces, but M&M is 30 per ounce. So, per large bag, it's 10 ounces, each ounce is 30 M&M, so 10 * 30 = 300 M&M per large bag.

Wait, so 3 large bags would be 3 * 300 = 900 M&M, same as before. So, 900 M&M in total.

He puts 10 M&M in each small bag, so 900 / 10 = 90 small bags. So, 90 is the answer. But the correct answer is 45, according to the user.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting "each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it." Maybe that's per ounce of the bag? Or is it per ounce of M&M?

Wait, no, the problem says an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it. So, each ounce is 30 M&M. So, each ounce contributes 30 M&M. So, 10 ounces would then be 10 * 30 = 300 M&M.

Wait, so each large bag is 10 ounces, so 300 M&M per large bag. So, 3 large bags would be 900 M&M.

He puts 10 each in small bags, so 900 / 10 = 90. So, 90 is the answer.

But maybe the problem is that each small bag is 10 ounces? Wait, no, the problem says he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. So, each small bag has 10 M&M, so we need to divide total M&M by 10.

Wait, is there a confusion between ounces and M&M?

Wait, the problem says, "each large bag weighing 10 ounces each." So, each large bag is 10 ounces. So, weight is 10 ounces per large bag, not M&M.

So, weight is 10 ounces, which is equal to 30 M&M per ounce. So, per large bag, 10 ounces equals 10 * 30 = 300 M&M.

So, 3 large bags: 3 * 300 = 900 M&M.

Each small bag: 10 M&M.

So, 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.

But the user says the correct answer is 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, he is referring to putting 10 ounces in each small bag? But that doesn't make sense because M&M is 30 per ounce.

Wait, let me read again:

"John packs M&M in small bags to eat. He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each. If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?"

Wait, so he buys 3 large bags, each 10 ounces. Each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M. So, per large bag, 10 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 300 M&M per large bag.

So, 3 large bags: 3 * 300 = 900 M&M.

He then wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. So, 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.

Wait, so that's 90. But why is the correct answer 45?

Wait, maybe the problem is that when he packs the M&M into small bags, the weight is 10 ounces per small bag? But that's not what the problem says.

Wait, the problem says he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. So, 10 M&M, not 10 ounces.

Hmmm. Wait, perhaps the ounces are referring to the M&M? But the problem says "he buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each." So, the bags themselves are 10 ounces each.

Wait, maybe it's a translation issue? Or perhaps I misread the ounces per M&M.

Wait, the problem says "an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it." So, an ounce of M&M is 30 M&M. So, each M&M must weigh less than an ounce, but that might not matter.

Wait, so if each large bag is 10 ounces, and each ounce is 30 M&M, so 10 ounces is 300 M&M. So, 3 bags is 900 M&M.

Putting 10 M&M in each small bag, so 900 /10=90.

So, unless the small bags have a weight limit? The problem doesn't specify. It just says he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. So, weight-wise, the small bags would have more weight, but as per the problem, we're only concerned with the number of M&M, or the number of small bags based on the number of M&M he has.

Alternatively, maybe we have to think differently. Maybe it's not total M&M, but the weight?

Wait, the problem says he wants to make small bags if he puts 10 in each small bag. So, maybe the small bags are also 10 ounces each? But the problem doesn't specify the weight of the small bags.

Wait, let me read it again: "how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?" So, it's about the number of small bags, given that each small bag can hold 10 M&M. So, the total number would be total M&M divided by 10.

So, 900 M&M /10 =90 small bags.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he is trying to fill each small bag with 10 ounces, not 10 M&M. But the problem says, "puts 10 in each small bag," so that must be 10 M&M.

Wait, maybe he's trying to put 10 ounces in each small bag, but each ounce is 30 M&M, so 10 ounces would be 300 M&M per small bag. Then, total M&M is 900, so 900 / 300 = 3 small bags. Hmm, but that seems even less.

Wait, that contradicts the problem statement. The problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, so I think it's 10 M&M, not 10 ounces.

Wait, but if that's the case, then 900 /10=90.

Wait, perhaps ounces is a red herring. Maybe the key is that each large bag is 10 ounces, but when you put 10 M&M in a small bag, each small bag is 10 ounces as well? But the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, maybe if each small bag is 10 ounces, but how much M&M can he put in each small bag? Since each ounce is 30 M&M, 10 ounces would be 300 M&M. So, if each small bag is 10 ounces, he can put 300 M&M in each. So, 900 /300=3 small bags.

But the problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, so unless the small bags can hold more M&M, but he's only putting 10 in each, so 10 per small bag.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe they are relating the total weight and the total M&M.

He has 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so total weight is 30 ounces.

Each ounce has 30 M&M, so total M&M is 30*30=900.

He wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. So, each small bag is 10 M&M, so number of small bags is 900/10=90.

Alternatively, maybe the small bags are each 10 ounces, so each small bag's weight is 10 ounces, but he can only put 10 M&M in it because each ounce is 30 M&M. Wait, that would mean that a 10-ounce small bag could hold 300 M&M, but he's only putting 10 in each.

I think the key is that he is only limited by the number of M&M he has, so 900 divided by 10 per bag is 90.

But the user says the correct answer is 45. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting something.

Wait, is it possible that the 10 ounces in the small bags are referring to the weight? So, each small bag is 10 ounces, and each ounce has 30 M&M.

So, if a small bag is 10 ounces, it can hold 10 *30=300 M&M.

Then, with 900 M&M, number of small bags would be 900 /300=3.

But that seems way too low.

Wait, but the problem says he puts 10 in each small bag. So, 10 M&M, not 10 ounces.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that 10 ounces is the weight per large bag, and each small bag is 1 ounce, so each small bag would have 30 M&M, but he is putting 10 in each small bag. So, 30 M&M per small bag, but he is only putting 10 in each. So, he can only fill 10/30 per ounce, so 10/30 per ounce, so 10 ounces would be 10*(10/30)=10/3≈3.33 small bags. But that also doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of small bags based on the weight? If each small bag is a certain weight, but the problem doesn't specify the weight of the small bags, only that he puts 10 M&M in each.

Wait, maybe it's a confusion between ounces and M&M. If each large bag is 10 ounces, and each ounce has 30 M&M, so each large bag is 10*30=300 M&M.

He has 3 large bags: 3*300=900 M&M.

Each small bag has 10 M&M, so 900/10=90 small bags.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is that each small bag is 10 ounces, but he's only putting 10 M&M in each. So, he only needs 10 ounces for each small bag, but each ounce is 30 M&M, so each small bag can hold 300 M&M, but he's only putting 10. So, 900 M&M divided by 300 per small bag is 3 small bags.

But the initial problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, which is 10 M&M, not referring to the weight.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's try to parse the problem again step by step.

"John packs M&M in small bags to eat. He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each. If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?"

So, step by step:

1. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, total weight is 3*10=30 ounces.

2. "If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it." So, 1 ounce =30 M&M.

3. How many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag.

So, 3 large bags: 30 ounces.

Each ounce:30 M&M.

Total M&M:30*30=900.

Each small bag:10 M&M.

Number of small bags:900/10=90.

So, 90 is the answer.

The user says the correct answer is 45, but I can't see how that would be. Unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, unless in the problem, it's 10 ounces per small bag, meaning each small bag is 10 ounces, and each ounce is 30 M&M, so each small bag can hold 10*30=300 M&M.

So, total M&M is 900, so 900 /300=3 small bags.

But the problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, so that's not 300, that's 10. So, maybe the small bags have a weight limit or something else.

Wait, maybe the issue is that when you put 10 M&M in a small bag, that's equal to 10 ounces? Because each M&M is 1/30 ounce.

Wait, let me compute the weight of 10 M&M.

Each ounce has 30 M&M, so each M&M is 1/30 ounce.

So, 10 M&M would be 10*(1/30)=1/3 ounce.

So, each small bag is 1/3 ounce.

He has 30 ounces total, so number of small bags is 30 / (1/3)=90.

Wait, so that's 90. Alternatively, if the small bags are 10 ounces, but he's only putting 10 M&M in each, which is 1/3 ounce, then 30 ounces /10 ounces per small bag=3 small bags. But that contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, so if 10 M&M is 1/3 ounce, then each small bag is 1/3 ounce. So, he can make 30 / (1/3)=90 small bags.

Alternatively, he could have small bags of 10 ounces each, in which case, since 10 ounces is equal to 300 M&M, but he's only putting 10 M&M in each, so 300 M&M per small bag, but he only has 900, so 3 small bags.

Wait, but the problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, which is 10 M&M, so we need to consider how many small bags based on that.

So, if he has 900 M&M and he puts 10 in each small bag, he can make 900 /10=90 small bags.

Alternatively, if he is restricted by some other factor, like the weight of the small bags. If the small bags have a fixed weight, say 10 ounces, then he can't have 90, because each small bag is 10 ounces, but he only has 30 ounces total. So, 30 /10=3 small bags.

But the problem doesn't specify the weight of the small bags, only that he puts 10 M&M in each small bag.

Wait, maybe he can't make the small bags from the same large bags? So, he has 3 large bags, each 10 ounces. So, he can create small bags by dividing them.

Wait, each large bag is 10 ounces. He can make 10-ounce small bags from them, but 10 ounces is equal to 300 M&M. But he wants 10 M&M per small bag. So, each small bag is 10 M&M.

Alternatively, if the small bags are made from the same source, maybe he can't just create 90 small bags from 30 ounces because he needs to pour the M&M in them.

Wait, I'm getting too confused.

Perhaps the correct answer is 90, but the user says the correct answer is 45, so I must be missing something.

Wait, let's try to think differently. Maybe it's a ratio problem.

He has 30 ounces total, each ounce is 30 M&M. So, total M&M is 900.

If he wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag, how many small bags can he make?

So, 900 /10=90.

Alternatively, if it's 10 ounces per small bag, each small bag can hold 300 M&M, so 900 /300=3.

But the problem doesn't say he puts 10 ounces in each small bag, it says he puts 10 M&M.

Wait, unless he is confused between ounces and M&M, but we have the data: ounces to M&M.

Wait, he puts 10 in each small bag. So, 10 M&M. So, 900 /10=90.

Alternatively, if each small bag is 10 ounces, and he needs to pour 10 ounces into each, but each small bag would then be 10 ounces, so 30 ounces total weight divided by 10 ounces per small bag is 3 small bags. So, 3.

But again, the problem says he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, not 10 ounces.

Wait, maybe the key is that he can't have more than 30 small bags because he only has 3 large bags.

But 30 vs 90 vs 3.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps we need to consider that each large bag is 10 ounces, which is 300 M&M, so 3 large bags is 900 M&M.

Each small bag can hold 10 M&M, so number of small bags is 900 /10=90.

I think 90 is correct.

But perhaps the original problem had a different interpretation, such as each small bag is 10 ounces, and he is trying to fit 10 M&M into each, so each small bag is 10 ounces, which is 300 M&M.

So, 900 /300=3.

But that's only 3 small bags.

Alternatively, is it 10 ounces per small bag, but he is only putting 10 M&M in each, which is 10 ounces total? No, because each M&M is 1/30 ounce.

Wait, 10 M&M is 10*(1/30)=1/3 ounce.

So, each small bag is 1/3 ounce.

So, with 30 ounces total, he can make 30/(1/3)=90 small bags.

So, 90.

Wait, so that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that he can only make small bags of 10 ounces each, so 30 ounces would make 3 small bags.

But that contradicts the information given, because he has 900 M&M. So, if he's making small bags that can hold 10 ounces each, but he only wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags is based on the number of M&M, not the weight.

Wait, so 900 M&M divided by 10 M&M per small bag is 90. So, 90 small bags. So, 90 is the answer.

I think the confusion is whether small bags refer to M&M or to ounces.

Wait, perhaps if each small bag is 10 ounces, so he can make 3 small bags because he only has 30 ounces. But that's not considering the M&M. Alternatively, he can make 90 small bags if he only considers the M&M.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of small bags he can make from the large bags, regardless of the M&M.

But no, the problem mentions M&M in the context of ounces.

Wait, "If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?"

So, the "if" is connecting the ounces of M&M to the number of M&M. So, the 30 M&M per ounce is given, so he can calculate total M&M.

Then, the "how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?" is about how many small bags can he make from the total M&M.

So, the process is:

Total M&M = number of ounces * M&M per ounce = 30 *30=900.

Number of small bags= total M&M / M&M per small bag=900 /10=90.

So, 90 is the answer.

Therefore, perhaps the user was told that the answer is 45, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is being misread. Maybe the large bags are 10 ounces each, and he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, which is 10 ounces, so each small bag is 10 ounces, which is 300 M&M, so he can only make 3 small bags.

But again, the problem says he puts 10 in each small bag, so 10 M&M.

Wait, unless he is only allowed to make small bags from each large bag.

So, each large bag is 10 ounces, so each large bag can make 10 / weight of small bags. But again, no weight given.

Alternatively, he has 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, but each ounce is 30 M&M. So, each large bag is 300 M&M, so 3 large bags are 900.

But he wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. So, number of small bags is 900 /10=90.

So, I think 90 is correct. So, the user might have been given incorrect info that 45 is the answer, but 90 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe he is asked for something else, like the number of small bags based on the weight, but that would be 3. But the problem is about the number of small bags he can make by distributing the M&M.

So, in conclusion, I think 90 is the correct answer.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is 45. So, perhaps the problem is in the way the ounces are being calculated.

Wait, let me check if 30 ounces are converted to M&M incorrectly.

Wait, he has 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so 30 ounces total.

Each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M, so 30 ounces *30=900.

Wait, that is correct.

But if he is only making small bags of 10 ounces each, he can make 3 small bags, but 3 small bags can hold 3*10=30 M&M? Wait, no.

Wait, no, each small bag holds 10 M&M, so each small bag is 10 M&M.

Wait, now I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, maybe he can't make 90 small bags because he can't pour M&M from one large bag into multiple small bags.

Wait, no, he can distribute the M&M from all large bags into small bags.

So, 900 M&M into 10 per small bag is 90.

But perhaps the problem is considering that each large bag can only be used once, but that's not the case because M&M can be combined.

Wait, maybe he is restricted by something else, like each small bag must have 10 ounces? But the problem doesn't say that. It says he puts 10 in each small bag, so 10 M&M.

Alternatively, maybe each small bag is a serving, and he wants 10 M&M per serving, so number of servings is 90.

So, yeah, 90. So, 90 small bags.

Wait, perhaps the user is thinking that each small bag is 10 ounces, so 30 ounces would make 3 small bags, but that isn't considering the M&M.

Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the calculation, thinking 30 ounces *30=900, but then divided by 10, but maybe he thought 30/10=3. So, 3*30=90, but 90 is wrong, 3 is wrong.

Wait, 30 ounces is 3*10, so 3 large bags.

30 ounces *30=900 M&M.

900 /10=90 small bags.

Alternatively, maybe he confused ounces and M&M.

Wait, he buys 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so 30 ounces.

Each ounce is 30 M&M, so 30*30=900.

He puts 10 in each small bag, so 900/10=90.

So, 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer, so 45 is wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is 90, so the user was told incorrectly that it's 45.

**Final Answer**
The correct number of small bags John can make is \boxed{90}.
</think>

John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight he has is 3 bags * 10 ounces each = 30 ounces. 

Each ounce of M&M has 30 M&M. So, the total number of M&M he has is 30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M.

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. Therefore, the number of small bags he can make is 900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags.

Thus, the correct number of small bags John can make is \boxed{90}.
