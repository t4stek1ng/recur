[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed for the kids and adults. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. Hmm, so each sleeve is like a single graham cracker that can make 8 smores? Or maybe each sleeve contains 8 graham crackers? Wait, the wording says, "Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores." Hmm, so does that mean one sleeve is enough to make 8 smores? Or is a sleeve a set of multiple graham crackers? 

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the number of smores per sleeve. So, if one sleeve makes 8 smores, then each smore must require one graham cracker as the base. So, each smore is a graham cracker with marshmallow and chocolate. So, if one sleeve makes 8 smores, that probably means one sleeve has 8 graham crackers. So, each sleeve is 8 graham crackers, and each smore is made from one graham cracker.

So, if there are 3 sleeves in a box, that means each box has 3 times 8 graham crackers, which is 24 graham crackers per box. Let me note that:

- 1 sleeve = 8 graham crackers
- 1 box = 3 sleeves = 3 * 8 = 24 graham crackers

Okay, so each box has 24 graham crackers. Now, each graham cracker can make one large smore. So, each box can make 24 smores.

Now, the problem says 9 kids want 2 smores apiece and 6 adults will eat 1 smore apiece. Let me calculate how many smores are needed in total.

First, for the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores each = 18 smores needed for kids.

Then, for the adults: 6 adults * 1 smore each = 6 smores needed for adults.

So, total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Wait, that's interesting. The total number of smores needed is 24, which is exactly the number of smores each box can make. So, they would need 1 box of graham crackers.

But let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes these problems can be tricky. Maybe I misinterpreted the number of graham crackers per sleeve.

Wait, the problem says "each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores." So, if each sleeve is used to make 8 smores, then each smore uses one graham cracker. So, each sleeve has 8 graham crackers. So, yes, 1 sleeve = 8 graham crackers, 3 sleeves = 24 graham crackers in a box.

So, each box can make 24 smores. The total required is 24 smores. Therefore, 1 box is enough.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of how many graham crackers each person is eating. Each kid eats 2 smores, each adult eats 1 smore.

So, 9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores for kids. 18 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 2.25 sleeves needed for kids.

6 adults * 1 smore = 6 smores for adults. 6 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 0.75 sleeves needed for adults.

Total sleeves needed = 2.25 + 0.75 = 3 sleeves.

Since each box has 3 sleeves, 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

So, regardless of whether I calculate based on total smores or total sleeves, I get 1 box needed.

Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 1 box.

Wait, but just to make sure, is the problem stating that each sleeve makes 8 smores or each graham cracker in the sleeve makes 8 smores? But no, the wording is "each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores." So, a sleeve is used to make 8 smores, each requiring one graham cracker. So, each sleeve has 8 graham crackers.

So, each box has 3 sleeves, which is 24 graham crackers, making 24 smores. Since they need 24 smores in total, 1 box suffices.

Alternatively, if I think about it as each person's consumption: 9 kids each having 2 smores is 18, and 6 adults each having 1 is 6, totaling 24. Each box is 24, so 1 box is enough.

I think that's solid. Initially, I thought the answer might be 1 box, but it's always good to check the calculations another way.

Another way: How many smores per person?

- Each kid: 2 smores
- Each adult: 1 smore

Total people: 9 kids + 6 adults = 15 people.

Total smores needed: 15 people * (2 for kids, 1 for adults). Wait, no, that's not straightforward because kids and adults have different consumption.

Wait, 9 kids * 2 = 18, 6 adults *1 = 6, so 18 +6=24.

Alternatively, if I think of it as: Each kid is 2 smores, each adult is 1. So, 9*2 +6=24.

Yes, 24 is the total.

So, each box can give 24 smores, so 1 box.

Therefore, the answer is 1 box.

**Final Answer**
They will need \boxed{1} box of graham crackers.

First, we determine that each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. This means each sleeve contains 8 graham crackers. Therefore, each box, which contains 3 sleeves, holds:

\[ 3 \text{ sleeves} \times 8 \text{ graham crackers per sleeve} = 24 \text{ graham crackers} \]

Each graham cracker can make one large smore, so each box can make:

\[ 24 \text{ graham crackers} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of smores needed. Nine kids each want 2 smores, and 6 adults each want 1 smore:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:

\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Since each box can make 24 smores, we need only 1 box. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
