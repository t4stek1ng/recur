<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Consider an electron in the n = 4, l = 1 state in hydrogen. Which of the following final states can NOT be reached by an allowed transition?. The options are: A. n = 3, l = 2, B. n = 3, l = 1, C. n = 3, l = 0, D. n = 2, l = 0.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about electrons in hydrogen atoms and allowed transitions. The question is asking which final state cannot be reached by an allowed transition. The initial state is n = 4, l = 1, which means the electron is in the fourth energy level, in a p orbital (since l = 1 corresponds to p). The options are:

A. n = 3, l = 2  
B. n = 3, l = 1  
C. n = 3, l = 0  
D. n = 2, l = 0

And the correct answer is supposed to be D. I need to figure out why. Hmm, let's start by recalling what determines allowed transitions in hydrogen atoms.

I remember that in hydrogen, the selection rules dictate which transitions are allowed or forbidden. The main rules are:

1. Δn: The change in the principal quantum number, n. For electrons in atoms, transitions are usually allowed if Δn = ±1, ±2, etc. But for hydrogen, I think the main restriction is on the angular momentum quantum number, l.

2. Δl: The change in the azimuthal or angular momentum quantum number. The selection rule here is Δl = ±1, meaning the electron can transition to a state where l increases or decreases by 1. However, I think there might be an exception when going to the ground state or something like that.

Wait, no, actually, the selection rule for hydrogen is more specific. For the electron transitions (emission or absorption), the change in l is restricted. For electric dipole transitions, which are the most common, the selection rule is Δl = ±1. So, the electron can only transition between states where l differs by 1.

But let me confirm that. Yeah, in hydrogen, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δn = any integer (as long as energy allows) and Δl = ±1. So, the electron can go from l = 1 to l = 0 or l = 2, as long as the other quantum numbers allow it.

So, looking at the initial state: n = 4, l = 1.

Let's examine each option.

Option A: n = 3, l = 2. So, the electron transitions from n=4 to n=3 (Δn = -1) and l=1 to l=2 (Δl = +1). Both changes are within the selection rules, so this transition is allowed. So A is allowed.

Option B: n = 3, l = 1. Here, Δn = -1 and Δl = 0. Wait, that's a problem. The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, so Δl = 0 would mean no change in l. So, does that make this transition forbidden? Hmm, but I thought sometimes Δl can be 0 in certain cases... Wait, no, in electric dipole transitions, Δl must be ±1. So, if l doesn't change, that would be a forbidden transition. Wait, but I'm confused because I remember that l can sometimes stay the same?

Therefore let me confirm that. Yeah, in hydrogen, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δn = any integer (as long as energy allows) and Δl = ±1. So, the electron can go from l = 1 to l = 0 or l = 2, as long as the other quantum numbers allow it.

So, looking at the initial state: n = 4, l = 1.

Let's examine each option.

Option A: n = 3, l = 2. So, the electron transitions from n=4 to n=3 (Δn = -1) and l=1 to l=2 (Δl = +1). Both changes are within the selection rules, so this transition is allowed. So A is allowed.

Option B: n = 3, l = 1. Here, Δn = -1 and Δl = 0. Wait, that's a problem. The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, so Δl = 0 would mean no change in l. So, does that make this transition forbidden? Hmm, but I thought sometimes Δl can be 0 in certain cases... Wait, no, in electric dipole transitions, Δl must be ±1. So, if l doesn't change, that would be a forbidden transition. Wait, but I'm confused because I remember that l can sometimes stay the same?

Now let me confirm that. Yeah, in hydrogen, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δn = any integer (as long as energy allows) and Δl = ±1. So, the electron can go from l = 1 to l = 0 or l = 2, as long as the other quantum numbers allow it.

So, looking at the initial state: n = 4, l = 1.

Let's examine each option.

Option A: n = 3, l = 2. So, the electron transitions from n=4 to n=3 (Δn = -1) and l=1 to l=2 (Δl = +1). Both changes are within the selection rules, so this transition is allowed. So A is allowed.

Option B: n = 3, l = 1. Here, Δn = -1 and Δl = 0. Wait, that's a problem. The selection rule for l is Δl = ±1, so Δl = 0 would mean no change in l. So, does that make this transition forbidden?
