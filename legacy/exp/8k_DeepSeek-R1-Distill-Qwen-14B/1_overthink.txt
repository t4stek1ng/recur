First, I need to determine the total number of smores required. There are 9 kids who each want 2 smores, so that's 9 multiplied by 2, which equals 18 kid smores. Additionally, there are 6 adults who each want 1 smore, so that's 6 adult smores. Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is 18 plus 6, which equals 24 smores.

Next, I need to figure out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed. Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 smores, I'll divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve. That is, 24 smores divided by 8 smores per sleeve equals 3 sleeves.

Finally, since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is 3 sleeves divided by 3 sleeves per box, which equals 1 box.

However, the question states that the correct answer is 0, which implies that no graham crackers are needed. This could mean that there are already enough graham crackers available, or that no smores will actually be made despite the initial calculation. Without additional context, it's unclear why the answer is 0, but it's important to consider that there might be underlying assumptions or external factors that justify this conclusion.

To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break down the requirements step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Smores Needed**
- **Kids:**
  - 9 kids × 2 smores each = **18 kid smores**
- **Adults:**
  - 6 adults × 1 smore each = **6 adult smores**

**Total smores needed:** 18 + 6 = **24 smores**

### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Sleeves Required**
- Each sleeve makes the base for **8 smores**.
- **Number of sleeves needed:** 
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves}
  \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Number of Boxes Needed**
- There are **3 sleeves** in a box.
- **Number of boxes needed:**
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box}
  \]

### **Conclusion**
Based on the calculations above, **1 box of graham crackers** is needed to provide the bases for all the smores required for both the kids and adults.

However, the question states that the **correct answer is 0**. This implies that, under the given circumstances, **no additional boxes of graham crackers are needed**. This could be due to:

1. **Sufficient Supply:** There might already be enough graham crackers available to meet the demand.
2. **No Smores Will Be Made:** Perhaps the event will not require the smores as initially planned.
3. **Clarification in Requirements:** There might be an external factor or a misinterpretation of the problem that leads to the conclusion that no additional graham crackers are necessary.

Without further context, it's essential to consider that the answer of **0** suggests that no additional boxes are required beyond what is already available or that the smores will not be prepared.

First, I need to calculate the total number of smores required. There are 9 kids, each wanting 2 smores, which totals to 18 smores for the kids. Additionally, there are 6 adults, each eating 1 smore, adding 6 more smores. In total, 24 smores are needed.

Each sleeve of graham crackers can make 8 smores. To find out how many sleeves are needed, I divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve: 24 ÷ 8 = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes required is 3 ÷ 3 = 1 box.

However, the question states that the correct answer is 0. This implies that there might be additional context or constraints not mentioned in the problem that lead to this conclusion. Perhaps there are enough graham crackers already available, or the event is hypothetical and no actual purchase is needed.

To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Each sleeve of graham crackers** makes the base for **8 large smores**.
- **3 sleeves** come in a **box**.
- **9 kids** want **2 smores each**.
- **6 adults** will eat **1 smore each**.

### **Calculations:**

1. **Total Smores Needed:**
   
   - **Kids:** \( 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \)
   - **Adults:** \( 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore/adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \)
   
   **Total smores required:** \( 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \)

2. **Sleeves Needed:**
   
   - Each sleeve makes **8 smores**.
   - Number of sleeves needed: \( \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \)

3. **Boxes Needed:**
   
   - Each box contains **3 sleeves**.
   - Number of boxes needed: \( \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1 \text{ box} \)

### **Conclusion:**
Based on the calculations, **1 box** of graham crackers is needed to provide enough smores for all the kids and adults.

However, the question mentions that the **correct answer is 0**. This implies that there might be additional context or constraints not provided in the problem that lead to this conclusion. For example, there could already be enough graham crackers available, or the scenario might not require any purchase of additional boxes.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{1}\)
