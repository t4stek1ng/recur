Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and their lifetimes, and I need to figure out why the energy difference between them should be 10^-8 eV. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to distinguish these two energy levels, and the question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly resolve them. The correct answer is apparently 10^-8 eV, and I need to understand why that is the case.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Specifically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know both the energy and the lifetime (or the position and momentum, but in this case, it's energy and time) of a particle. The principle is often written as:

ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2

Where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (lifetime), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So, in this case, the lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. I assume Δt here is the uncertainty in the lifetime, or maybe it's the actual lifetime itself? Hmm, I think for the purposes of this problem, we can take Δt as the lifetime of the state. So, the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty in energy, and vice versa.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, not the uncertainty in energy. So, how does the energy difference relate to the lifetimes?

I think the idea is that in order to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy introduced by the measurement process. If the energy difference is too small, the uncertainties from the lifetimes could make it impossible to distinguish the two states.

So, if we have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainties in their energies would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). Then, to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference |E2 - E1| must be greater than some factor times the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, or maybe the sum? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Hence wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, not the uncertainty in energy. So, how does the energy difference relate to the lifetimes?
