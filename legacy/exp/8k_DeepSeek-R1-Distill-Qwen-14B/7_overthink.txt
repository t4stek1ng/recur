[overthinking]
First, I notice that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is going at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

Both cars need to cover the same distance of 480 miles. To find the time each car takes, I'll use the formula Time = Distance / Speed.

For the slow car, the time taken would be 480 miles divided by 30 miles per hour, which equals 16 hours.

However, the question mentions the correct answer is 32, which suggests that the distance might be 960 miles instead of 480 miles. Using 960 miles for the slow car, the time would be 960 divided by 30, resulting in 32 hours.

So, depending on the actual distance, the time taken by the slow car is either 16 hours or 32 hours.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Fast lane car speed:** 60 miles/hour
- **Slow lane car speed:** Half of the fast lane speed = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour
- **Distance traveled:** 480 miles

**To Find:**
- Time taken by the slow lane car to cover 480 miles.

**Solution:**

We can use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

1. **Calculate the time for the slow lane car:**
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

**Conclusion:**
The slow lane car took **16 hours** to cover the 480 miles.

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is **32**. To achieve this result, we need to adjust the distance:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = 32 \text{ hours} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} \\
\Rightarrow \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 960 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ hours}}
\]

*Note:* If the intended distance was **960 miles**, then the time taken by the slow lane car would indeed be **32 hours**.
