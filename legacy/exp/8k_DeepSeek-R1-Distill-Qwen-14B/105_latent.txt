Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question involves bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoing some reactions and then determining the splitting pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a norbornane structure, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. The "2-one" part means there's a ketone group on the second carbon. So, the structure has a ketone at one of the bridgehead positions.

The first reaction is irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. From what I recall, UV irradiation of ketones typically leads to Norrish type reactions. There are two types: Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II. Norrish I is cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the carbonyl, which usually forms a biradical. Norrish II involves hydrogen abstraction leading to a six-membered transition state, which results in a gamma hydrogen shift. However, the condition here is UV radiation, and I think Norrish I is more likely under these conditions because Norrish II usually requires higher temperatures or more energy, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, actually, Norrish Type I is more common with UV light because it's a cleavage reaction. So, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one undergoing Norrish I would break the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent bridgehead carbon. That would form two fragments. But since the molecule is bicyclic, breaking one bridge might lead to ring opening. Hmm, maybe it forms a diradical, and then the molecule would undergo some rearrangement.

Alternatively, I've heard that bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one upon UV irradiation undergoes a ring-opening reaction to form a conjugated diene. How? Let me think. The ketone group could undergo a cleavage, but in a bicyclic system, the ring strain might influence the product. Maybe it forms a more stable diradical, leading to ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's more of a [2+2] photocycloaddition, but that usually involves two molecules. No, the question says it's product 1, a single product. So maybe it's an intramolecular reaction. Alternatively, the ketone could abstract a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, leading to a diradical and then a ring-opening.
