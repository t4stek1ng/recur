<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Let M be a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with tape alphabet {blank,0,1}, and let C denote the (possibly infinite) computation of M starting with a blank tape. The input to each problem below is M, together with a positive integer n. Which of the following problems is (are) decidable?
I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.
II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.
III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.. The options are: A. None, B. III only, C. I and II only, D. I and III only. Why the correct answer is B. III only?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've got this question about Turing machines and whether certain problems are decidable. Let me try to work through each part step by step. I remember that a Turing machine has a tape, a head that can read and write, and a set of states. It follows a set of rules to move the head and change symbols based on the current state and what's on the tape.

The question is asking about three different problems, I, II, and III, and whether they're decidable when given a Turing machine M and a positive integer n. The options are that none are decidable, only III is, only I and II, or I and III. The answer is supposed to be B, which is III only. I need to figure out why.

Let me start by understanding each problem:

I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.

So, does the Turing machine run for n or more steps when starting from a blank tape? We need to decide if this is always possible to determine.

II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.

This is two conditions: first, that it runs for at least n steps, and second, that after those n steps, it writes a 1 somewhere on the tape.

III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.

This means that the head moves over n different cells on the tape during the computation.

Now, I need to recall what is decidable for Turing machines. A problem is decidable if there's an algorithm that can always answer it in a finite amount of time. For Turing machines, problems like whether they accept a given string, or whether they halt on a specific input, are often undecidable due to the halting problem.

Let's tackle problem I first: whether the computation lasts at least n steps.

I think that this is related to the concept of the halting problem. The question is whether, given M and n, we can decide if M will take n steps. But wait, actually, the question is whether the computation C (which is the infinite computation starting from a blank tape) lasts for at least n steps. So, is M guaranteed to reach step n? Or could it halt before that?

But if M halts before step n, then the computation doesn't last n steps. If it doesn't halt by step n, then it does last at least n steps. So, the question is whether we can decide whether M will halt before step n or not.

But the halting problem is undecidable in general. Given a Turing machine and an input, we can't decide whether it will halt. However, here, we're not given an input; we're just considering the computation starting from a blank tape. So, maybe it's a bit different.

Again the halting problem is undecidable in general. Given a Turing machine and an input, we can't decide whether it will halt. However, here, we're not given an input; we're just considering the computation starting from a blank tape. So, maybe it's a bit different.

Moreover the halting problem is undecidable in general. Given a Turing machine and an input, we can't decide whether it will halt. However, here, we're not given an input; we're just considering the computation starting from a blank tape. So, maybe it's a bit different.
