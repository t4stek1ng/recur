First, I need to calculate the total cost of Charlotte's items before the discount. She purchased a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the utensils by multiplying the number of utensils by the price per utensil: 5 utensils × $5.00 = $25.00.

Then, I'll add up the costs of all the items: $120.00 (pots and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00 total before the discount.

Since there's a 20% discount available, I'll calculate 20% of $165.00: 0.20 × $165.00 = $33.00 discount.

Finally, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Wait, that's not matching the expected answer of $198. Maybe I misunderstood the discount application.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount was only applied to the mixing bowls and utensils, not the entire purchase. Let's recalculate with that possibility.

The cost before discount is still $165.00. If only $20.00 (mixing bowls) and $25.00 (utensils) are discounted by 20%, that totals $45.00. 20% of $45.00 is $9.00. So, the discounted amount would be $9.00.

Subtracting the discount: $165.00 - $9.00 = $156.00. This still doesn't match $198.

Wait, perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the discount percentage. Let me check if the discount was 20% off the total price.

20% of $165.00 is $33.00. Subtracting that gives $132.00, which is still not $198.

Alternatively, maybe the discount was applied incorrectly, such as adding instead of subtracting. If $33.00 was added to the total, it would be $198.00, which matches the expected answer.

Therefore, it's possible that the clerk mistakenly added the discount amount to the total instead of subtracting it, leading to an incorrect total of $198.00.
</think>

Sure, let's break down Charlotte's purchase step by step to determine the total cost after the 20% discount.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost Before Discount**

Charlotte purchased the following items:
- **Set of Pot and Pans:** $120.00
- **Set of Mixing Bowls:** $20.00
- **5 Separate Utensils:** 5 × $5.00 = $25.00

**Total Cost Before Discount:**
\[
\$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00 = \$165.00
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Discount Amount**

The store offers a 20% discount on the total purchase.

**Discount Amount:**
\[
20\% \text{ of } \$165.00 = 0.20 \times \$165.00 = \$33.00
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost After Discount**

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount.

**Total Cost After Discount:**
\[
\$165.00 - \$33.00 = \$132.00
\]

### **Conclusion**

Charlotte's total order amount after applying the 20% discount is **\$132.00**.

\[
\boxed{\$132.00}
\]

First, I need to calculate the total cost of Charlotte's items before applying the discount.

Charlotte is purchasing:
- A set of pots and pans for $120.00
- A set of mixing bowls for $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each

Calculating the cost of the utensils:
5 utensils × $5.00 = $25.00

Adding up all the items:
$120.00 (pots and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00

Now, applying the 20% discount to the total:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 × $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

However, the correct answer provided is $198.00. To reconcile this, I need to consider the possibility that the discount was applied incorrectly. If the discount was mistakenly applied at a higher rate or applied twice, it could result in the total being $198.00. Therefore, the correct total after the proper 20% discount should be $132.00, not $198.00.
</think>

Let's break down Charlotte's order step by step to find out the total amount she paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Each Item**

Charlotte purchased three items:
1. **Set of Pots and Pans:** \$120.00
2. **Set of Mixing Bowls:** \$20.00
3. **5 Separate Utensils:** \$5.00 each

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost Before Discount**

First, find the total cost of the utensils:
\[
5 \text{ utensils} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00
\]

Now, add up all the items:
\[
\$120.00 \, (\text{pots and pans}) + \$20.00 \, (\text{mixing bowls}) + \$25.00 \, (\text{utensils}) = \$165.00
\]

**Step 3: Apply the 20% Discount**

The clerk mentioned that everything is 20% off. To find the discount amount:
\[
20\% \, \text{of} \, \$165.00 = 0.20 \times \$165.00 = \$33.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$165.00 - \$33.00 = \$132.00
\]

**Conclusion:**

Charlotte's total order after applying the 20% discount should be:
\[
\boxed{\$132.00}
\]

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is \$198.00. This suggests there might be additional information or a different discount application method that wasn't considered in the initial calculation. If you have further details or if the discount was applied differently (e.g., only to certain items), please provide them for a more accurate calculation.

Let's break down Charlotte's order step by step to find the correct total amount she needs to pay.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost Before Discount**

Charlotte purchased three items:
1. **Set of Pots and Pans:** \$120.00
2. **Set of Mixing Bowls:** \$20.00
3. **5 Separate Utensils:** \$5.00 each

**Cost of Utensils:**  
5 utensils × \$5.00/utensil = **\$25.00**

**Total Cost Before Discount:**  
\$120.00 (pots and pans) + \$20.00 (mixing bowls) + \$25.00 (utensils) = **\$165.00**

### **Step 2: Calculate the Discount**

The clerk informed Charlotte that everything is **20% off**.

**Discount Amount:**  
20% of \$165.00 = 0.20 × \$165.00 = **\$33.00**

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost After Discount**

**Total Cost After Discount:**  
\$165.00 (total before discount) - \$33.00 (discount) = **\$132.00**

### **Conclusion**

Based on the calculations above, Charlotte's total order amount after applying the 20% discount is:

\[
\boxed{132}
\]

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is **\$198**, which does not align with the information provided in the problem. It's possible that there might be additional details or a misunderstanding in the original problem statement that leads to the \$198 figure. If more context or details are available, they could help clarify this discrepancy.

Let's break down Charlotte's order step by step to determine the total cost after applying the 20% discount.

**1. Calculate the Cost of Each Item:**

- **Set of Pot and Pans:** \$120.00
- **Set of Mixing Bowls:** \$20.00
- **5 Separate Utensils:** \$5.00 each

**Total Cost Before Discount:**
\[
\$120.00 \ (\text{pots and pans}) + \$20.00 \ (\text{mixing bowls}) + (5 \times \$5.00) \ (\text{utensils})
\]
\[
= \$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00
\]
\[
= \$165.00
\]

**2. Apply the 20% Discount:**

The discount is calculated on the total amount before any reductions.

\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \ \text{of} \ \$165.00 = 0.20 \times \$165.00 = \$33.00
\]

**3. Calculate the Total Amount After Discount:**

\[
\text{Total After Discount} = \$165.00 - \$33.00 = \$132.00
\]

**Conclusion:**

Charlotte's total order after applying the 20% discount is:

\[
\boxed{\$132.00}
\]

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is \$198, which doesn't align with the calculations above. It's possible that there may be additional items or a different discount structure not accounted for in the initial problem statement.

Sure, let's break down Charlotte's order step by step to find out the total amount she paid after the discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Each Item**

1. **Set of Pot and Pans:** \$120.00
2. **Set of Mixing Bowls:** \$20.00

\text{Total Cost Before Discount} = \$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00 = \$165.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Discount**

The store offers a 20% discount on everything. 

\[
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$165.00 = 0.20 \times \$165.00 = \$33.00
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the Discount from the Total Cost**

\[
\text{Total Cost After Discount} = \$165.00 - \$33.00 = \$132.00
\]

**Conclusion:**

Charlotte's total order amount after applying the 20% discount is:

\[
\boxed{132}
\]

However, you mentioned that the correct answer is \$198. This suggests there might be additional information or a different discount structure not accounted for in the original problem. If there are more details or a different discount percentage, please provide them so I can adjust the calculation accordingly.
