<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?
I. One's complement
II. Two's complement
III. Sign and magnitude. The options are: A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. I, II, and III. Why the correct answer is B. II only?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about adding two numbers using 8-bit representations, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B, which is only Two's complement. The question is asking in which of the representations (One's complement, Two's complement, or Sign and magnitude) the addition of 109 and -42 is within range. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall how each of these representations work, especially with 8-bit numbers. 8 bits mean that the range of numbers we can represent is from -128 to 127 in Two's complement, right? For One's complement, it's a bit different because there are two zeros, but I think the range is from -127 to 127. And for Sign and magnitude, the range is the same as One's complement because the most significant bit is the sign, and the remaining 7 bits give a value from 0 to 127. So, Sign and magnitude can represent numbers from -127 to 127 as well. Wait, no, actually, in 8 bits, Sign and magnitude can represent -127 to 127 because the sign bit is one bit, and the rest are magnitude. But wait, 2^7 is 128, so with 7 bits, you can represent 0 to 127, so negative numbers would be from -1 to -127. So, yeah, the range is -127 to 127.

But in Two's complement, it's -128 to 127 because the representation is a bit different; the negative numbers are offset by one. So, 109 and -42, let's see: 109 is positive, and -42 is negative. So, in 8 bits, both of these numbers should be representable in each of these systems, right?

Wait, but the question is about adding them and whether the result is within range. So, we need to check if when we add 109 and -42, the sum is within the representable range for each system.

First, let's compute 109 + (-42). That's 109 - 42, which is 67. So, 67 is a positive number, and in 8 bits, we need to see if 67 can be represented in each system without overflow.

Then, but the question is about adding them and whether the result is within range. So, we need to check if when we add 109 and -42, the sum is within the representable range for each system.

First, let's compute 109 + (-42). That's 109 - 42, which is 67. So, 67 is a positive number, and in 8 bits, we need to see if 67 can be represented in each system without overflow.
