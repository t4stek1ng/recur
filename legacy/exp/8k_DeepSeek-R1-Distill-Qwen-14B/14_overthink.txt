[overthinking]
Juan needs to determine how many pounds of butter he requires to make 4 dozen croissants daily for a week.

He knows that each dozen croissants requires 1/4 pound of butter.

First, calculate the daily butter needed:
4 dozen × 1/4 pound per dozen = 1 pound per day.

Next, calculate the total butter needed for a week:
1 pound per day × 7 days = 7 pounds.

However, the correct answer provided is 10 pounds, which suggests there might be additional information or requirements not accounted for in the initial calculation.

To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Butter required per dozen croissants:** \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound
- **Number of dozens per day:** 4
- **Number of days:** 1 week (7 days)

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Butter Requirement
First, find out how much butter is needed for one day.

\[
\text{Daily butter} = \text{Number of dozens per day} \times \text{Butter per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Daily butter} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Butter Requirement
Next, multiply the daily butter requirement by the number of days in a week.

\[
\text{Weekly butter} = \text{Daily butter} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
\text{Weekly butter} = 1 \times 7 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Conclusion
Juan will need **7 pounds** of butter to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week.

However, if the correct answer provided is **10 pounds**, there might be additional factors or requirements not mentioned in the initial problem. To match the answer of 10 pounds, we can consider that Juan might be preparing for an extra day or there might be additional croissants required beyond the stated 4 dozen per day.

\[
\boxed{7 \text{ pounds}}
\]
