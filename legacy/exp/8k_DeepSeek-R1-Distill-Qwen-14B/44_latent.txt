<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light reflection off a thin oil layer on water. Hmm, I remember something about thin film interference from my classes. Let me try to recall.

The question says white light is normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an oil layer on top. The oil is 500 nm thick, and its index of refraction is 1.5. The water has an index of 1.33. They're asking which wavelength is most strongly reflected, and the options are 500, 550, 600, or 650 nm. The correct answer is supposed to be D, 650 nm. I need to figure out why that is.

Alright, so when light hits a thin film, part of it reflects off the top surface, and part goes through and reflects off the bottom surface. These two reflected waves can interfere with each other. Depending on the phase changes, this can either amplify or reduce the reflection.

First, I need to think about the indices of refraction. The light goes from air (n=1) into oil (n=1.5), then into water (n=1.33). So, when light goes from a lower index to a higher index, it reflects with a phase shift of half a wavelength (λ/2). Conversely, when it goes from higher to lower, no phase shift.

So, starting with the first reflection: air to oil. Since 1.0 < 1.5, that's a lower to higher index. So the reflection at the top of the oil will have a phase shift of λ/2.

Then, the transmitted light goes through oil to water. Oil has a higher index than water (1.5 > 1.33), so when it reflects off the oil-water interface, it's going from higher to lower. So that reflection doesn't have a phase shift. But wait, actually, in this case, the light is going through oil and reflecting off water. So, oil to water: 1.5 to 1.33. That's higher to lower, so no phase shift upon reflection at the oil-water interface.

Wait, but also, the light has traveled through the oil layer. The thickness is 500 nm. So, the path difference between the two reflected rays (the one that reflected off the top of the oil and the one that went through and reflected off the water) is twice the thickness of the oil (because it goes down and back up). So the path difference is 2 * 500 nm = 1000 nm.

But light has a wavelength in the medium, not in vacuum. So, the wavelength in oil is different from the wavelength in air or water. Hmm, right. The wavelength λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since n≈1). So, the wavelength of the light in oil is smaller.

No light has a wavelength in the medium, not in vacuum. So, the wavelength in oil is different from the wavelength in air or water. Hmm, right. The wavelength λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since n≈1). So, the wavelength of the light in oil is smaller.

Again light has a wavelength in the medium, not in vacuum. So, the wavelength in oil is different from the wavelength in air or water. Hmm, right. The wavelength λ = λ0 / n, where λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum (or air, since n≈1). So, the wavelength of the light in oil is smaller.
