<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton’s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be. The options are: A. deflected in the +x-direction, B. deflected in the -x-direction, C. deflected in the +y-direction, D. deflected in the -y-direction. Why the correct answer is D. deflected in the -y-direction?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. A proton is accelerated through a potential difference V and then moves into a region with electric and magnetic fields. Initially, it's not deflected, but when the potential is doubled to 2V, it gets deflected. The question is why the correct answer is D, which says it's deflected in the -y-direction.

Let me break this down step by step. First, when the proton is accelerated through a potential difference V, it gains kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) is given by KE = qV, where q is the charge of the proton. Since it's moving in the +z-direction, its initial velocity is along z.

Now, when it enters the region with electric field E in the +x-direction and magnetic field B in the +y-direction, it's said that the proton's trajectory isn't affected. That probably means that the net force on the proton is zero in that region. I remember from the Lorentz force law that the total force on a charged particle is F = q(E + v × B). So, if the proton isn't deflected, F must be zero.

So, setting F to zero: q(E + v × B) = 0. Dividing both sides by q, we get E + v × B = 0. That means E = -v × B.

Let me write that down: E = -v × B. Since E is in the +x-direction, and B is in the +y-direction, let's figure out the cross product v × B.

The velocity v is along +z, and B is along +y. The cross product of v and B would be in the direction determined by the right-hand rule. Pointing fingers along +z, then curling towards +y, the thumb will point in the direction of the cross product. Wait, actually, the cross product v × B is v (z) cross B (y). The cross product of z and y is... Hmm, the right-hand rule for z cross y.

Let me think: The standard unit vectors are i (x), j (y), k (z). So, i × j = k, j × k = i, and k × i = j. Wait, no: actually, the cross product is anti-commutative, so j × k = - (k × j). Let's be precise. The cross product of unit vectors is given by the right-hand rule.

So, for z × y: z is k, y is j. The cross product k × j. Using the right-hand rule: point index finger along k (z), middle finger along j (y). The thumb will point in the direction of k × j. Wait, actually, if I point my right hand's index along z, middle along y, the thumb will point towards negative x-direction. Because k × j = -i. So, k × j = -i, which is -x-direction.

So, E is equal to -v × B. If v × B is in -x, then E is equal to -(-x) which is +x. That matches the given electric field direction. So, that makes sense. So, initially, E = -v × B, meaning the forces from E and v × B cancel each other, so the proton isn't deflected.

Now, when the potential is doubled to 2V, the proton's kinetic energy is doubled as well because KE = qV. Since KE is (1/2)mv², doubling KE means the velocity is sqrt(2) times the original velocity. So, the velocity increases.

Let's denote the original velocity as v, so the new velocity is v' = sqrt(2) * v. Since the velocity is along +z, the direction remains the same, but the magnitude increases.

Now, the electric field E is still in the +x-direction, and the magnetic field B is still in the +y-direction. Let's recalculate the net force on the proton now that the velocity has increased.

The Lorentz force is F = q(E + v' × B). We need to compute v' × B. The velocity is now v' = sqrt(2) * v in the z-direction. So, v' × B = (sqrt(2) * v) * (B in y) cross product.

Again, using the right-hand rule: v' is along +z, B is along +y. So, v' × B is again in the -x-direction, same as before but scaled by sqrt(2). So, v' × B = sqrt(2) * (v × B). Since v × B was -x, v' × B is sqrt(2) * (-x) = -sqrt(2) * x.

Now, the electric field E is +x. So, the forces are: E contributes +x, and v' × B contributes -sqrt(2) * x. So, the net force is E + v' × B scaled by q. The total force F = q(E + v' × B). Plugging in, F = q*(+x - sqrt(2)*x). Let's factor out x: F = q*x*(1 - sqrt(2)).

Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, 1 - sqrt(2) is about -0.414. So, F is in the negative x-direction, scaled by that factor. But wait, that would mean the force is in the -x direction, but the options are about deflection in x or y. However, wait a second, the electric field is along x, and the magnetic force is along x as well. So, the net force is along x, but in which direction?

Wait, hold on. When the proton enters the region with E and B, the forces are along x. But initially, it wasn't deflected because the forces balanced. Now, when velocity increases, the magnetic force becomes stronger, so the net force becomes in the direction opposite to E.

Wait, no. Let's recast this. Initially, E = -v × B. When velocity increases, v' is larger, so v' × B is larger in magnitude. So, E + v' × B would be E minus a larger term, meaning the net force is in the direction opposite to E, which is -x.

No, no. Let's recast this. Initially, E = -v × B. When velocity increases, v' is larger, so v' × B is larger in magnitude. So, E + v' × B would be E minus a larger term, meaning the net force is in the direction opposite to E, which is -x.

Now, no. Let's recast this. Initially, E = -v × B. When velocity increases, v' is larger, so v' × B is larger in magnitude. So, E + v' × B would be E minus a larger term, meaning the net force is in the direction opposite to E, which is -x.
