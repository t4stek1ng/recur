[overthinking]
To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, I will start by calculating the total number of cupcakes he currently has. Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes in total.

Next, I will find out how many more cupcakes are needed to reach the required 63 cupcakes. By subtracting the cupcakes he already has (48) from the total needed (63), I can determine the additional cupcakes Paul needs to purchase.

Finally, subtracting these numbers gives me the answer: 63 minus 48 equals 15. Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy.

**Problem Statement:**
Paul needs a total of **63 cupcakes** for a birthday party. He already has:
- **8 chocolate cupcakes**
- **40 toffee cupcakes**

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Cupcakes Paul Already Has**

\[
\text{Total cupcakes Paul has} = \text{Chocolate cupcakes} + \text{Toffee cupcakes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cupcakes Paul has} = 8 + 40 = 48 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

**Step 2: Determine How Many More Cupcakes Paul Needs to Buy**

\[
\text{Additional cupcakes needed} = \text{Total cupcakes needed} - \text{Total cupcakes Paul has}
\]
\[
\text{Additional cupcakes needed} = 63 - 48 = 15 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is **22**. To reconcile this discrepancy, let's consider if there might be additional information or context not provided in the original problem. For example, if Paul wants to have a buffer or if there are other constraints, the required number of cupcakes might increase. 

If we assume that Paul needs 63 cupcakes and ends up buying 22 more, the total number of cupcakes he would have is:

\[
8 + 40 + 22 = 70 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

But since the original problem states he needs **63 cupcakes**, the accurate calculation shows he needs to buy **15 more cupcakes**. Therefore, the correct answer based on the given information is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
