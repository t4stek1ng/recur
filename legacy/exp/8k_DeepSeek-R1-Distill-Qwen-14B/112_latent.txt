<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>The SN2 reaction in organic chemistry involves a nucleophile replacing a leaving group in a single, concerted step. One key feature of SN2 reactions is stereochemical inversion, where the spatial arrangement of substituents around the carbon atom undergoing substitution changes. This inversion occurs when the base extract proton and the nucleophile attack the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group, leading to a reversal in stereochemistry.
Considering the reaction, what are the reactants and products of the following reaction?
(R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) ---> B
Why the correct answer is A = LDA, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about an SN2 reaction, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about SN2 reactions. SN2 stands for substitution nucleophilic bimolecular, right? It's a one-step reaction where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group, causing inversion of configuration. That's the key point—stereoinversion happens because the nucleophile comes in from the backside.

The reaction given is: (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) → B. The question is asking what A and B are, and the correct answer is A = LDA, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine. I need to understand why that's the case.

First, let me parse the given compound. The starting material is (R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. "N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)" suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at the 2-position, which is ethyl. The "idene" part indicates a double bond—so cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring. Then, the N indicates that there's an amine group attached to this cyclohexene ring. The ethanaminium part means that the amine is protonated, forming an ammonium ion. So the structure is an ammonium salt where the nitrogen is attached to a cyclohexene ring at the 2-position (with an ethyl group) and another ethyl group (since ethanaminium implies two carbons on the amine, so CH2CH3 or maybe CH2CH2? Wait, ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH2 with a proton, so CH3CH2NH3+? Or is it N-ethyl attached to the cyclohexene? Maybe I should draw this.

Wait, the structure is N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium is a two-carbon chain attached to the amine, which is positively charged. So the structure would be: cyclohexene (double bond between C1 and C2, maybe), with an ethyl group on C2, and the amine (NH) is connected to that C2. The ethanaminium part would be CH2CH3NH3+? So the nitrogen has three substituents: the cyclohexylidene group, an ethyl group (from ethanaminium), and two hydrogens? Wait, no, ethanaminium is -(CH2)2NH3+, so the nitrogen has three ethyl groups? No, wait, ethanaminium is ethylammonium: CH3CH2NH3+. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring where one of the carbons (probably C2) is double-bonded, has an ethyl group, and an N connected to the rest. So the nitrogen is part of an ammonium group, with two CH2 groups? Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize.

The starting material is an enamine. Enamines are compounds where an amine is connected to a carbon that's part of a double bond. Enamines are typically formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. They're used in organic synthesis because they can undergo various reactions, like Michael addition, or act as nucleophiles.

Wait, in this case, the starting material is an enamine with a cyclohexene ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene (cyclohexane with a double bond, maybe between C1 and C2) where C2 has an ethyl group and an N-ethyl group attached. Wait, no, the ethyl is part of the cyclohexylidene and the amine is ethanaminium. So maybe it's a cyclohexene where C2 is attached to an ethyl group and a CH2CH2NH3+ group? Or perhaps it's a six-membered ring with a double bond, and on one of the double bond carbons (C2), there's an ethyl group and an amine substituent.

So, in this case, the starting material is an enamine with a cyclohexene ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene (cyclohexane with a double bond, maybe between C1 and C2) where C2 has an ethyl group and an N-ethyl group attached. Wait, no, the ethyl is part of the cyclohexylidene and the amine is ethanaminium. So maybe it's a cyclohexene where C2 is attached to an ethyl group and a CH2CH2NH3+ group? Or perhaps it's a six-membered ring with a double bond, and on one of the double bond carbons (C2), there's an ethyl group and an amine substituent.
