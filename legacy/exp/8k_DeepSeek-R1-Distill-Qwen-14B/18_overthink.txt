First, I need to define the variables based on the given information.

Let \( T \) represent the spinning speed of a thingamabob.

According to the problem, a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so its speed is \( 5T \).

A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed is \( 11T \).

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, I can set up the equation \( 11T = 121 \).

Solving for \( T \), I divide both sides by 11, which gives \( T = 11 \) meters per second.

Now, to find the speed of the whirligig, I multiply \( T \) by 5: \( 5T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \) meters per second.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding because the correct answer should be 55 meters per second, not 27.

However, if the intended answer is 27, it could be that the problem meant the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the whirligig. In that case, setting up the equation \( 11W = 121 \) would lead to \( W = 11 \), and since the whirligig is five times faster than the thingamabob, the calculations would adjust accordingly. But based on the original problem statement, the correct speed for the whirligig is 55 meters per second.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- A **whirligig** spins at **five times** the speed of a **thingamabob**.
- A **whatchamacallit** spins at **eleven times** the speed of a **thingamabob**.
- The speed of a **whatchamacallit** is **121 meters per second**.

**Let’s define the variables:**
- Let \( T \) be the speed of a **thingamabob** in meters per second.

**Step 1: Express the speeds in terms of \( T \).**
- **Whirligig** speed: \( 5T \)
- **Whatchamacallit** speed: \( 11T \)

**Step 2: Use the given speed of the whatchamacallit to find \( T \).**
\[
11T = 121 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \, \text{m/s}
\]

**Step 3: Find the speed of the whirligig.**
\[
\text{Whirligig speed} = 5T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \, \text{m/s}
\]

**Conclusion:**
The whirligig spins at **55 meters per second**.

However, the user mentioned that the correct answer is **27**. This discrepancy suggests there might be a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of the problem statement. If we reconsider the relationships:

- If the **whirligig** spins at **five times** the speed of the **whatchamacallit**, the calculation would be:
\[
\text{Whirligig speed} = 5 \times 121 = 605 \, \text{m/s}
\]
- If the **whatchamacallit** spins at **eleven times** the speed of the **whirligig**, then:
\[
11 \times \text{Whirligig speed} = 121 \, \text{m/s} \implies \text{Whirligig speed} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Neither of these interpretations leads to **27 m/s**. Therefore, it's likely that there was a mistake in the problem formulation or the interpretation of the relationships between the spinning speeds.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

First, I need to understand the relationships between the spinning speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

I know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. If I let the thingamabob's speed be \( t \), then the whatchamacallit's speed is \( 11t \). 

Given that the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, I can set up the equation \( 11t = 121 \) and solve for \( t \). Dividing both sides by 11 gives \( t = 11 \). 

So, the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. 

Next, the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the whirligig's speed is \( 5t \). Substituting \( t = 11 \) into this equation gives \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \) meters per second. 

However, the correct answer is stated to be 27 meters per second. This suggests that there might be an error in the initial assumptions or the way the relationships between the speeds were interpreted.

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how fast a whirligig spins.

### **Given:**
1. **A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.**
   
   \[
   \text{Whirligig speed} = 5 \times \text{Thingamabob speed}
   \]
   
2. **A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.**
   
   \[
   \text{Whatchamacallit speed} = 11 \times \text{Thingamabob speed}
   \]
   
3. **A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.**

### **Step 1: Find the Speed of a Thingamabob**

From the second point:
\[
\text{Whatchamacallit speed} = 11 \times \text{Thingamabob speed}
\]

Given that the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 m/s:
\[
121 = 11 \times \text{Thingamabob speed}
\]
\[
\text{Thingamabob speed} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s}
\]

### **Step 2: Find the Speed of a Whirligig**

From the first point:
\[
\text{Whirligig speed} = 5 \times \text{Thingamabob speed}
\]
\[
\text{Whirligig speed} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ m/s}
\]

### **Conclusion**

Based on the given relationships and calculations, the whirligig spins at **55 meters per second**.

However, the problem states that the correct answer is **27**. There might be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation of the relationships between the spinning speeds. To reconcile the correct answer of 27, the relationships might need to be redefined or additional constraints may apply.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55 \text{ meters per second}}
\]
