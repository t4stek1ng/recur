<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield 0. The state of the system is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. Hmm, I think I need to use quantum mechanics here because we're dealing with observables and states, which are concepts from that field.

Let me recall. In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and the state is a vector in a Hilbert space. To find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (in this case, 0), I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and then compute the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and each eigenvector.

Wait, but first, is P a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Looking at P:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, the conjugate transpose would have the same elements since all the elements are real. So, P is equal to its transpose, which means it's symmetric. In real matrices, symmetric matrices are Hermitian because their transpose equals their conjugate transpose. So yes, P is Hermitian, which is good because observables should be Hermitian.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of the measurement, and the eigenvectors correspond to the states where the outcome is certain. Since I want the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then see how the given state relates to those eigenvectors.

But wait, maybe a faster way is to compute the expectation value of P and then find the probability that the measurement gives 0. Hmm, no, expectation value is the average outcome, but I need the probability. So, I think I need to stick with the eigenvalue approach.

So, first step: find eigenvalues of P.

I can do this by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let's write down P - λI:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Compute the determinant of this matrix. That will give me the characteristic equation.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be computed by expansion. Let's do it step by step.

The determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] ) + 0 * det(...)
