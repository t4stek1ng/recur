Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about De Broglie's hypothesis. It's asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, Rydberg's constant, and the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light. Hmm, I need to figure out why that's the case.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. This is the foundation of wave-particle duality. So, he suggested that every particle has a wavelength associated with it. But I'm not entirely sure how this relates to the constants provided.

I think the formula involved is the De Broglie wavelength. Let me recall it. I believe it's lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the linear momentum of the particle. So, lambda = h / p. That seems familiar. If that's the case, then the constant involved here is Planck's constant, which is option A. But the answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about the relationship between linear momentum and wavelength. So, the formula lambda = h / p directly relates wavelength and momentum through Planck's constant. So, why is the speed of light the correct answer? Maybe I have a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to relativistic considerations. I know that in special relativity, momentum is related to mass and velocity. The relativistic momentum is p = gamma * m * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But how does that tie into the wavelength?

Hold on, maybe the question is hinting at the relativistic form of the De Broglie wavelength. Let me think. If we have a particle moving at relativistic speeds, does the formula change? Well, the standard De Broglie wavelength is lambda = h / p, regardless of whether it's relativistic or not. So, p is still gamma * m * v, but h is still Planck's constant.

Wait, unless the question is implying that the speed of light comes into play because of the relativistic momentum, but that doesn't directly tie into the wavelength formula. The wavelength is still h divided by p, so the constant involved is h.

This is confusing because the answer is supposedly D, but according to my understanding, it's A. Maybe I'm misremembering something. Let me check other related formulas.

Oh, wait, I remember something about energy and momentum in relativity. The energy E is related to momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But that's about energy, not wavelength. Unless they're connecting wavelength to energy somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of wave equations, the speed of light (or the wave speed) is related. For light, the wavelength and frequency are related by c = lambda * nu. But again, that's for light, and De Broglie's hypothesis is about particles having wavelength, not that their speed is related to the wave speed.

Wait, another thought: In quantum mechanics, the momentum operator is related to the wave number, which is 2pi divided by wavelength. So, p = h / lambda. That again points to h being the constant, not c.

Is there a scenario where the speed of light comes into play with De Broglie's hypothesis? Maybe when considering particles at relativistic speeds, but even then, the formula lambda = h / p remains the same. Unless the momentum p is expressed in terms of relativistic mass, but that still doesn't involve c in the formula for the wavelength.

Hold on, perhaps the confusion is between the Compton wavelength and the De Broglie wavelength. The Compton wavelength is another concept where c is involved. The Compton wavelength is lambda_c = h / (m c). So, in that case, the speed of light is part of the equation. But Compton wavelength is different from De Broglie wavelength. De Broglie wavelength is h / p, and Compton is h / (m c). So, that might be where the confusion is.

But the question specifically mentions De Broglie's hypothesis, so it's about lambda = h / p, which is De Broglie's, not the Compton wavelength. So, the constant here is h, Planck's constant.

But the answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light. Maybe I've made a mistake. Let me think again. Is there any version of the De Broglie formula that includes c?

Wait, if we have a particle moving at speed v, its momentum is p = gamma m v. But unless we're relating it to energy, which is E = gamma m c², but that doesn't tie into the wavelength directly.

Alternatively, in the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But that's about energy, which is a different relationship.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the question is about the relation involving frequency. De Broglie also related frequency to energy. For photons, E = h nu, but for particles, the energy is related to the frequency of their associated wave. However, that again brings in Planck's constant, not the speed of light.

Alternatively, if we're considering the phase velocity of the particle's wave function, which is c² / v, where v is the group velocity. But that's more about wave propagation and doesn't directly link the momentum and wavelength.

I'm getting stuck here. The initial formula I remember is lambda = h / p, so the constant is h. But the answer is c. Maybe the question is worded differently. Let me read it again: "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So, the relation between p and lambda is through h. So, the constant is h.

But if the correct answer is D, the speed of light, perhaps the question is referring to a different formula. Maybe in some contexts, like for photons, p = h nu / c, so p = h c / lambda, which would involve c. But that's for photons, not massive particles.

Wait, the question says "a free massive particle," so it's not a photon. Thus, p = h / lambda, so h is the constant. So, the answer should be A. But the user says the correct answer is D. Maybe the question is from a different source, and I need to figure out why.

Is there a version where De Broglie's hypothesis uses the speed of light? Let me think. If we consider natural units where c =1, but that's more of a system of units thing, not part of the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question. The options are constants, so c is a constant, h is a constant. If the formula is lambda = h / p, the constant is h. So, unless the question is about the relation between momentum and frequency, which would involve h and c for photons, but for massive particles, it's h.

Wait, another thought: De Broglie's hypothesis also relates frequency to energy. The frequency nu is related to the energy E by E = h nu. For a massive particle, the energy E is gamma m c², so nu = gamma m c² / h. But that again involves c, but that's in the energy relation, not directly between p and lambda.

So, if the question is specifically about the relation between p and lambda, it's h. If it's about the relation between E and lambda, it might involve c.

But in the question, it's about linear momentum and wavelength, so it's h. So, why is the answer D? Maybe the original question was about frequency or energy, but the user provided a wrong answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct answer is A. But the user claims it's D. Let me think if there's any way c is involved in the basic De Broglie relation.

Wait, for a particle with rest mass m, the rest energy is mc², and the Compton wavelength is h/(mc), which involves c. But that's not De Broglie's wavelength, which is h/p. So, unless the question is confusing the two, but it's specifically about De Broglie.

Alternatively, maybe the question is in a context where p = gamma m v, and if v approaches c, but even then, the formula lambda = h/p still holds, and c isn't directly a part of it unless you express p in terms of v and c.

But in De Broglie's formula, it's just h divided by p, regardless of the speed. So, the constant is h.

I'm starting to suspect that the correct answer should be A, Planck's constant, but the user says the answer is D. Maybe the question was misworded or there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about relativistic momentum, and in that case, p is related to m and v, which could involve c if considering relativistic effects, but the relation between p and lambda is still h/p.

Wait, unless the question is about the product of momentum and wavelength. If p * lambda = h, then h is the constant. So, the constant is h.

Another angle: Maybe the question is referring to the relation between momentum and wavelength in terms of wave equations. In quantum mechanics, the wave equation uses momentum operator p = -i h / (2 pi) d/dx, but that's more about operators, not the direct relation between p and lambda.

Alternatively, in wave terms, the momentum is related to the wave number k, which is 2 pi / lambda, so p = h k / (2 pi), which simplifies to p = h / lambda. So again, h is the constant.

I'm going in circles here. The conclusion I keep coming back to is that the constant relating momentum and wavelength in De Broglie's hypothesis is Planck's constant. So, the correct answer should be A, not D.

Unless there's a different interpretation. Maybe the question is about the relationship in natural units where c=1, but that's more of a unit system thing, not a fundamental constant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the question, and the intended answer was A, but the options were mislabeled.

Wait, let me check the original question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" The options are A. Planck’s constant, B. Boltzmann’s constant, C. The Rydberg constant, D. The speed of light.

Given that, I think the correct answer is A. Unless De Broglie's relation somehow involves c, which I don't recall. Maybe in the relativistic form, but even then, the formula remains h/p.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up with the relativistic energy. If you have a particle moving at speed v, its momentum is gamma m v, and its energy is gamma m c². So, E = (pc²)/c² + (mc²)²? No, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So, E = sqrt( (pc)² + (mc²)² ). But that's about energy, not wavelength.

But if we have E = h nu, and for a wave, c = lambda nu, so nu = c / lambda. Therefore, E = h c / lambda. So, for photons, p = E / c = h / (lambda). So, for photons, p = h / lambda, same as De Broglie's formula.

But for massive particles, if you consider their rest energy, perhaps there's another relation. But I think the main point is that for any particle, momentum is related to wavelength via h.

I'm really not sure why the answer would be D. Maybe the person who made the question confused De Broglie's wavelength with the Compton wavelength, which does involve c. The Compton wavelength is lambda_c = h / (m c). So, if someone confuses the two, they might think c is involved.

But the question is about De Broglie's hypothesis, which is about lambda = h / p. So, the constant is h, not c.

Alternatively, maybe in some derivations, you use c when expressing p in terms of other variables. For example, if you have a particle moving at speed v, p = gamma m v. But unless you're relating v to c, which you don't in the basic De Broglie formula.

Wait, another thought: If you have a photon, which is massless, its energy is E = pc, so p = E / c. But that's for photons, not massive particles. The question is about a free massive particle, so that's not applicable.

I'm stuck. Based on what I know, the answer should be A. Planck's constant. Maybe the person who provided the answer made a mistake, or the question was misworded.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, when considering wave packets or wave functions, the speed of light comes into play, but I don't recall that being part of De Broglie's original hypothesis.

Wait, another angle: De Broglie's hypothesis also includes that the frequency of the wave is related to the particle's energy. So, if you have a particle with kinetic energy K, its frequency nu is K / h. But that's another relationship, not directly between momentum and wavelength.

If you combine the two, you can relate velocity to wavelength somehow, but that would involve both h and other constants, but not directly c.

Wait, maybe the question is about relativistic momentum, and in that case, the momentum includes gamma, which depends on v and c. But again, the formula for wavelength is h / p, so unless you're expressing p in terms of velocity and mass and gamma, c doesn't directly come into play in the p-lambda relation.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. My conclusion is that the correct answer should be Planck's constant, option A. Unless the question is incorrect or there's a specific context I'm missing.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**. De Broglie's hypothesis relates the wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a particle to its momentum (\(p\)) through the equation \(\lambda = \frac{h}{p}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant. This equation directly ties the momentum and wavelength using Planck's constant, not the speed of light. The confusion might arise from other constants like the speed of light appearing in related formulas, such as in relativistic energy equations or the Compton wavelength, but these are not part of De Broglie's original hypothesis. Therefore, the constant involved in the direct relationship between linear momentum and wavelength is Planck's constant.

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about De Broglie's hypothesis. Hmm, I remember that De Broglie proposed something about particles having wave-like properties. I think he said that every particle has a wavelength associated with it, right? So, particles like electrons or protons have a wavelength.

The question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, Rydberg's constant, and the speed of light. I need to figure out why the speed of light is the correct answer here.

Let me think about what De Broglie's equation actually is. I believe it's lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the linear momentum of the particle. So, rearranged, that would mean p equals h over lambda. Wait, but the question is about the relationship between linear momentum and wavelength. So, it's h over p equals lambda, so h is involved here.

But the options don't include Planck's constant as the correct answer—it's option A. But the correct answer is supposedly D, the speed of light. That doesn't seem to fit with what I remember. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about a relativistic relationship or something else. De Broglie's original hypothesis was for particles with non-relativistic speeds, right? So, in that case, it's just h over p. But if we're considering relativistic speeds, does the speed of light come into play?

Hold on, let me think about the equation again. The De Broglie wavelength is lambda = h / p, so the relationship directly involves Planck's constant. Therefore, the constant that relates momentum and wavelength is Planck's constant, which is option A. But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light.

Maybe I'm missing something. Is there another formula where the speed of light is involved with momentum and wavelength? Let me think about relativistic momentum. The relativistic momentum p is gamma times m times v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But how does that relate to wavelength?

Alternatively, could the question be mixing up different constants? Maybe in some other context, like the Compton wavelength, but that's different. The Compton wavelength is h over (2 pi m c), but that's not the same as De Broglie's wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. If we consider that for a photon, which is massless, the wavelength is related to momentum by p = h / lambda. But photons also have energy E = pc, so combining these gives E = h c / lambda. But that's about photons, not massive particles.

For a massive particle, De Broglie's equation is lambda = h / p, so the constant is h. So, unless the question is referring to something else, like relativistic energy-momentum relation, which is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But that's a different equation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is confusing frequency with wavelength. The Planck relation is E = h f, where f is frequency. But that's for photons. For particles, the energy is different.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between De Broglie's hypothesis and the relativistic energy-momentum relation. If we have E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, then if we solve for p, we get p = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2) / c^2. But that introduces speed of light, but the De Broglie wavelength is still h / p, so it still relates via Planck's constant.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let's go back to De Broglie's original equation. He said that the wavelength lambda is equal to Planck's constant h divided by the linear momentum p. So, lambda = h / p. Therefore, the constant involved is h, which is Planck's constant.

So, if the question is about which constant relates p and lambda, the answer should be Planck's constant, which is option A. But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. That must mean either the question is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, is the question maybe from a different source, and perhaps it's not referring to De Broglie's equation but something else? Maybe in some contexts, the speed of light is involved, like in relativistic equations, but in the case of De Broglie's hypothesis, it's purely h over p.

Alternatively, could the question be referring to the relationship between momentum and frequency? For photons, yes, p = h f / c, so there the speed of light comes in. But for massive particles, it's not the case. So, if the question is about a free massive particle, which is what the question specifies, then the speed of light wouldn't be involved in the relationship between p and lambda.

Hmm, maybe the question is incorrect or the answer provided is wrong. But since the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question is not about the direct relationship but involves another factor.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is implying relativistic momentum. So, in the relativistic case, momentum p is gamma m v, and if we're relating p and lambda, then perhaps through the energy. But I don't see how speed of light directly relates p and lambda unless we're combining equations.

Alternatively, maybe it's considering that for massless particles, like photons, p = E / c, and E = h f, so p = h f / c, and since lambda = c / f, then p = h / lambda. So, in that case, p = h / lambda, which again brings in Planck's constant.

But the question is about a free massive particle, so it's not a photon. Therefore, the speed of light doesn't directly come into play in the relationship between p and lambda for a massive particle.

Wait, unless the particle is moving at the speed of light, but then it wouldn't be massive. So that's not possible.

I'm a bit stuck here. According to what I know, De Broglie's equation is lambda = h / p, so the constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A. But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light.

Maybe the question is from a non-English source and there was a translation error. Or perhaps the options are mislabeled. Alternatively, the question might be about a different relationship that involves the speed of light.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in physics, constants are combined. For example, the reduced Compton wavelength is h / (2 pi m c). So, that involves h and c. But in De Broglie's wavelength, it's just h over p.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relativistic energy equation where E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ), but that's about energy, not directly about wavelength.

Wait, let's think about units. Planck's constant has units of J·s or kg·m²/s. Momentum has units of kg·m/s. So, h / p would have units of m, which is correct for wavelength. So, h is the constant.

On the other hand, the speed of light has units of m/s. If we were to relate p and lambda with c, we would need to have something like p = something involving c and lambda, but the units don't add up unless we have other constants.

Wait, let's check the units for p = h / lambda. h is J·s, which is kg·m²/s. lambda is m. So, kg·m²/s divided by m is kg·m/s, which is correct for momentum. So, units check out for h.

If we tried to use c, then what would p be? If p = something with c, say, p = h c / lambda, then units would be (J·s)(m/s) / m = (kg·m²/s)(m/s)/m = kg·m²/s², which is kg·m/s, which is correct for momentum. Wait, so if p = h c / lambda, then units also work. But is that the case?

Wait, no, that's not the case. For a photon, E = h f = h c / lambda, and E = pc, so p = E / c = h c / lambda / c = h / lambda. So, for a photon, p = h / lambda. For a massive particle, it's the same, p = h / lambda. So, the speed of light doesn't come into play here.

So, in the De Broglie equation, whether the particle is massive or not, p = h / lambda. Therefore, the constant is h, Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if the question is about relativistic momentum, but even so, p = gamma m v, but that doesn't involve c unless we're talking about the relationship between energy and momentum, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², but that's a different equation.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing De Broglie's wavelength with the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength is lambda_c = h / (m c), so that does involve c. But that's a specific wavelength for a particle's mass, not the general De Broglie wavelength.

So, if the question was about the Compton wavelength, then c would be involved. But the question is about De Broglie's hypothesis, which is the general case for any particle's wavelength related to its momentum.

Therefore, unless the question is incorrect or the options are mislabeled, I think the correct answer should be Planck's constant, option A. But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light, so perhaps the question is different or there's some confusion.

Maybe the question is referring to the relativistic relation where p = gamma m v, and v approaches c, but that's not a direct relationship between p and lambda.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the formulas, thinking that because light has p = E / c, and E = h f, so p = h f / c, and since lambda = c / f, then p = h / lambda. So, in that case, for light, p = h / lambda, but it involves c in the derivation. But for massive particles, it's still p = h / lambda, regardless of c.

So, in conclusion, the constant that relates the linear momentum and wavelength is Planck's constant, which is option A. Therefore, unless there's a misunderstanding or the question is incorrect, I think the answer should be A.

But since the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light, I must be missing something. Maybe the question is about the relationship between frequency and wavelength, which for light is c = lambda f, but that's a different equation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the energy of a photon, E = h f = h c / lambda, which does involve c, but that's for photons, not massive particles.

Wait, putting it all together, I think the confusion arises because for photons, both h and c are involved in the relationship between energy and wavelength, but for De Broglie's hypothesis, it's just h over p. So, if the question is about a massive particle, the answer should be h, Planck's constant.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A, Planck’s constant, and perhaps the user was mistaken in thinking it's D.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength (λ) of a particle is related to its linear momentum (p) by the equation λ = h / p, where h is Planck’s constant. This equation directly involves Planck’s constant, making it the correct choice. The speed of light (c) is not involved in this specific relationship for a free massive particle. 

Answer: A. Planck’s constant.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about De Broglie's hypothesis, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Let me start by recalling what I know about De Broglie's work. I remember that he proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties, kind of like how light has particle-like properties. This is the basis for wave-particle duality.

The question is asking about the relationship between linear momentum and wavelength for a free massive particle. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, The Rydberg constant, and The speed of light. Hmm, I think the formula involved is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is momentum. So, in that case, the constant involved would be Planck's constant, right?

Wait, but the question is asking which constant relates linear momentum and wavelength. So if lambda = h/p, then h is Planck's constant. So why is the answer speed of light? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Let me think again. De Broglie's equation is indeed lambda = h/p. So h is Planck's constant, which is option A. But the answer is D, the speed of light. Maybe the question is referring to relativistic effects? Because in special relativity, momentum is gamma times m times v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But does that bring in the speed of light?

Wait, let me write down the equation again. For a free particle, the relativistic momentum p is gamma*m*v, and the energy E is gamma*m*c squared. Also, De Broglie's relation is p = h/lambda. So maybe in the relativistic case, there's another relation involving the speed of light.

But the question specifically mentions the relationship between linear momentum and wavelength, not involving energy. So if p = h/lambda, then h is the constant. But why would the speed of light be the answer?

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which is another concept. The Compton wavelength is lambda_c = h/(m*c), where c is the speed of light. But that's a different concept, right? The Compton wavelength is associated with the mass of a particle and the speed of light, but that's not De Broglie's equation.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing different formulas. Let me double-check. De Broglie's hypothesis directly relates momentum and wavelength via Planck's constant. So in that equation, it's h, not c. So why is the answer c?

Is there another relation where c is involved? For example, in the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But that involves energy, momentum, and mass, and the speed of light. But again, that's a different equation.

Hold on, maybe the confusion is because sometimes in equations, constants can be expressed in different ways. For instance, sometimes constants are expressed using other constants. But in the original De Broglie equation, it's definitely Planck's constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that for light, which is massless, the momentum is related to wavelength through p = E/c, and E = hc/lambda, so p = h/(lambda). So, for light, p = h/lambda, which is similar to De Broglie's equation. But for massive particles, it's the same formula, so the constant is still h.

Wait, but the question is asking which constant relates momentum and wavelength for a free massive particle. So, it's h. But the answer is c. That doesn't add up. Maybe the question is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question. If the particle is free, maybe it's moving at a certain speed, but I don't think that relates to the De Broglie wavelength. The formula is still p = h/lambda.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the relativistic relation where p = gamma*m*v, and if you set that equal to h/lambda, then the speed of light comes into play when considering gamma or something else. But no, gamma is about energy, not directly about the wavelength.

Alternatively, maybe the question is confusing the De Broglie wavelength with other wavelengths, like the Compton wavelength, which does involve c. Let me check the Compton wavelength: lambda_c = h/(m*c). So that has c in it, but that's not the same as De Broglie's wavelength.

So, perhaps the confusion is between De Broglie's wavelength and Compton wavelength. The question specifically mentions De Broglie's hypothesis, so it should be h. But the answer provided is c, which makes me think maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. If it were about the Compton wavelength, then c would be the answer. But the question is about De Broglie, which is h.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that in some formulations, constants are expressed in terms of other constants. For example, sometimes h is written as h = 2pi h-bar, but that's still Planck's constant.

I'm confused. According to what I know, De Broglie's equation is lambda = h/p, so the constant is h, which is option A. So why is the answer D, the speed of light? Maybe the person who wrote the question made a mistake, or I'm missing some key point.

Wait, is there a version of the De Broglie equation where c is involved? Let me think. If a particle's wavelength is related to its momentum, which is h/p, but if you express momentum in terms of velocity, p = m*v, then lambda = h/(m*v). So, unless m is expressed in terms of other constants, I don't see c coming into play.

Alternatively, if the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play, but the De Broglie equation remains lambda = h/p. So even if p includes gamma, it's still h.

Wait, unless the question is referring to the relationship between momentum and wavelength in a medium where the speed of light is involved, but the question says a free particle, so it's in a vacuum.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up De Broglie's hypothesis with the photoelectric effect, where energy is related to frequency via E = h*f, but that's not directly about momentum.

I'm going in circles here. My initial thought is that the correct answer should be A, Planck’s constant, because lambda = h/p. But the answer given is D, the speed of light. Maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misremembering something.

Wait, maybe it's about the units. Let me think about the units. Planck's constant has units of J*s, which is kg*m²/s. Momentum is kg*m/s. So when you divide h by p, you get (kg*m²/s)/(kg*m/s) = m, which is correct for wavelength. So units check out with h.

The speed of light has units of m/s. If the constant were c, then h*c would have units of kg*m²/s², which is energy. But that's not relevant here.

So, unless the formula is different, I can't see how c would come into play in De Broglie's equation. Therefore, I think the correct answer should be A, Planck’s constant. So why is the given answer D?

Maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps it's a different version of the equation. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the Compton wavelength involves c, but that's not De Broglie's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relativistic relation where p = gamma*m*v, and gamma involves c, but that's more about energy than wavelength.

Wait, unless someone is confusing De Broglie's hypothesis with the relation between frequency and energy for photons, where E = h*f = h*c/lambda. But that's for light, not for massive particles.

So, I'm still convinced that the correct answer is A, Planck’s constant. Unless there's some other relation I'm missing, I don't see how the speed of light would be involved in the basic De Broglie equation.

Maybe the question is incorrect, or perhaps it's a trick question. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, constants are expressed in terms of other constants, but I don't think that's the case here.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer should be A, Planck’s constant, because De Broglie's equation directly relates wavelength and momentum through h. So I'm confused why the answer is D. Maybe I need to double-check some sources.

Wait, maybe I should look up De Broglie's equation again. According to my notes, De Broglie's hypothesis states that any particle has a wavelength associated with it given by lambda = h/p, where p is the momentum. So h is Planck's constant.

Therefore, unless the question is referring to a different concept, the answer should be A. So perhaps the original answer key is incorrect, or maybe the question was misworded.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that in quantum mechanics, the momentum operator involves the derivative, which has units related to inverse seconds or something, but that's not directly relevant.

Wait, another thought: in natural units, sometimes constants are set to 1, but that's not standard here. The question is asking about the constant relating momentum and wavelength, which is h.

So, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is A, Planck’s constant, unless there's a specific context where c is involved, which I'm not recalling at the moment.

Perhaps the confusion arises because in some equations, like the relativistic energy-momentum relation, c is present, but that's not the same as the De Broglie wavelength relation.

So, unless the question is about a different equation, I stick with A. Maybe the answer key is wrong.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is A. Planck’s constant. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength λ of a particle is related to its momentum p by the equation λ = h/p, where h is Planck’s constant. Therefore, the constant involved in this relationship is Planck’s constant, not the speed of light.

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about De Broglie's hypothesis. The question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, Rydberg’s constant, and the speed of light. The answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light, but I'm a bit confused because I thought De Broglie's equation involved Planck's constant.

Let me start by recalling what De Broglie's hypothesis says. I remember that he proposed that particles like electrons have a wavelength associated with them, just like light. The formula I remember is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. So lambda = h/p. That would mean that the relationship between momentum and wavelength is through Planck's constant, right?

But the answer here is the speed of light. Maybe I'm mixing up different formulas. Let me think. There's another equation related to wave-particle duality, but I'm not sure if it's the same as De Broglie's. I know that the speed of light, c, is related to the frequency and wavelength of light by c = lambda * nu, where nu is the frequency. But that's for light, not for particles with mass.

Wait, so maybe the question is a bit tricky. De Broglie's equation is lambda = h/p, which involves Planck's constant. But perhaps in some contexts, like relativistic situations, another constant comes into play? Or maybe it's about the relativistic relation between momentum and energy?

Let me think about the relativistic energy-momentum relation. That's E squared equals (pc)^2 plus (mc^2)^2. But that's about energy, not directly about wavelength. Unless we're combining it with De Broglie's wavelength.

Hold on, maybe the question is referring to a different formula. I'm a bit confused because I'm pretty sure De Broglie's hypothesis directly relates momentum and wavelength via Planck's constant. So why is the answer the speed of light? Maybe there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Compton wavelength, which is another concept. The Compton wavelength is related to the mass of a particle and is given by lambda = h/(2pi m c). But that involves Planck's constant and the speed of light. But in that case, it's about the rest mass and wavelength, not directly momentum.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between different constants in different equations. De Broglie's is lambda = h/p, so h is the constant. But if the question is about relativistic momentum, which is p = gamma m v, but that doesn't involve the speed of light in the relationship between p and lambda. Unless we're considering relativistic effects on the wavelength.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline what I know:

1. De Broglie's hypothesis: lambda = h/p. So the constant here is Planck's constant, h. So if the question is about this relationship, the answer should be A, Planck's constant.

2. But the given answer is D, speed of light. So maybe the question is not about the direct relationship but something else.

Wait, could it be about the relativistic relation where momentum is related to velocity? But in De Broglie's equation, it's just p, not velocity. So unless they're considering that p is relativistic momentum, which involves gamma and v, but that might not directly tie in the speed of light into the wavelength relation.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how in special relativity, the momentum is related to energy via E = pc, but again, that's not directly about the wavelength.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in equations, constants can be expressed in terms of other constants. For example, Planck's constant can be written in terms of energy and frequency, but that's not directly relevant here.

I'm starting to think that maybe the correct answer is Planck's constant, and the given answer of speed of light is incorrect. But why would the question say the answer is D?

Alternatively, is there a different formula where the speed of light is involved in relating momentum and wavelength? Maybe in accelerator physics or something, but I can't recall.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is Planck's constant, but the person who wrote the question thought it was something else. Or perhaps I'm misremembering the formula.

Let me double-check De Broglie's equation. Yes, it's lambda = h/p. So the constant is h, which is Planck's constant. So why is the correct answer the speed of light?

Unless the question is misworded. Maybe it's not about the free massive particle but about a photon. Because for photons, the relationship between momentum and wavelength is p = h/(lambda), but also, since for photons, E = pc, and E = hc/(lambda), so p = h/(lambda). So Planck's constant is still involved.

But the question specifies a free massive particle, so it's not a photon. So the relationship is still lambda = h/p.

Therefore, the constant involved should be Planck's constant, which is option A. But the given answer is D. Maybe the options were mislabeled?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relativistic case where p = gamma m v, and if we relate that to wavelength, but again, that would still involve Planck's constant.

Wait, another angle: sometimes in equations, constants like c can appear when combining different relations. For example, energy E is related to wavelength by E = hc/(lambda). But that's for photons. For massive particles, E is related to wavelength through their momentum and mass, but that would still tie back to Planck's constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing De Broglie's hypothesis with the Einstein relation for photons, where E = pc, so p = E/c. But that's for photons, not massive particles.

I'm really stuck here. I think the correct answer should be Planck's constant because De Broglie's equation directly uses h. So why is the answer the speed of light?

Maybe it's a mistake in the question, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking. Is it possible that the question is referring to the relationship between momentum and frequency, not wavelength? Because then, using E = h nu and E = pc, we get p = h nu / c. So in that case, the constant would be Planck's constant divided by the speed of light, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Compton wavelength, which is lambda = h/(m c). So that involves Planck's constant and the speed of light, but in that case, it's about the rest mass, not the momentum.

Wait, so if you have a particle with momentum p, then the Compton wavelength is lambda = h/(m c), but the De Broglie wavelength is lambda = h/p. So unless they're equating these two, you could relate p to m c, but that seems like a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly stating the hypothesis, or I'm misremembering.

Wait, let me check online. No, I can't do that, but I have to rely on my memory. I think De Broglie's equation is definitely lambda = h/p, so h is Planck's constant. So unless the question is about the relativistic momentum, which is p = gamma m v, but even then, the relationship between p and lambda is still through h.

So I'm confused why the answer is the speed of light. Maybe the question is referring to a different concept, or perhaps it's a trick question where the speed of light comes into play indirectly, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relationship between momentum and wavelength in a different context, like in the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope of the question.

Wait, another thought: in the equation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, if we solve for p, we get p = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)/c. But that's about energy, not directly about wavelength.

Alternatively, for a photon, p = E/c, and E = hc/lambda, so p = h/(lambda c). But that's for photons, not massive particles, and it's not De Broglie's hypothesis.

I'm going in circles here. I think the answer should be Planck's constant because De Broglie's equation directly relates wavelength and momentum through h. So unless the question is incorrect or the options are mislabeled, I don't see why the speed of light would be the answer.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the fact that for a free particle, the momentum p is related to its velocity v by p = mv, and in some cases, v could be a significant fraction of c, so c is involved indirectly. But that's not a constant relating p and lambda; it's about the momentum itself.

So, in conclusion, I'm unsure why the answer is the speed of light. My understanding is that De Broglie's hypothesis uses Planck's constant to relate momentum and wavelength. Perhaps the question intended the answer to be Planck's constant, but it was mistakenly marked as D. Or maybe I'm missing something here.

After thinking through all these possibilities, I still believe the correct answer should be Planck's constant, so option A. But since the given answer is D, I'm probably misunderstanding something or there's a trick in the question.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum, expressed as \(\lambda = \frac{h}{p}\), where \(h\) is Planck’s constant. This relationship directly involves Planck’s constant, not the speed of light. Therefore, the initial assertion that the answer is the speed of light seems to be a mistake. The reasoning process explored various possibilities but consistently supported Planck’s constant as the correct constant involved in De Broglie's equation.

**Answer:** A. Planck’s constant
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about De Broglie's hypothesis, and I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Let me start by recalling what De Broglie's hypothesis is all about. From what I remember, De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties, right? So, he suggested a relationship between a particle's momentum and its wavelength.

The question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, Rydberg's constant, and the speed of light. Hmm, I think I remember something about Planck's constant being involved in this relationship because I've seen equations where Planck's constant (h) is used. But wait, the question says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. That's confusing because I thought it was Planck's constant.

Let me think more carefully. The formula I remember is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum. So, that would imply that the constant involved is Planck's constant, which is option A. But the question says the answer is D. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, is there a different formula or another constant involved? Maybe De Broglie's equation is sometimes written differently. I know that in some contexts, people use h-bar instead of h, where h-bar is h divided by 2π. But even then, it's still Planck's constant. Unless there's another relation that ties in the speed of light.

Hold on, perhaps the question is referring to relativistic cases? If a particle is moving at speeds close to the speed of light, maybe the relationship changes. But De Broglie's original hypothesis was for free particles, which I think are non-relativistic. So, in that case, the equation lambda = h/p should hold, and the constant would be Planck's constant.

But why is the answer speed of light then? Maybe the confusion comes from the units. Let me check the units. Planck's constant has units of J·s, which is energy multiplied by time. Momentum has units of kg·m/s. If I take h divided by p, the units would be (J·s)/(kg·m/s) = (N·m·s)/(kg·m/s) = (kg·m/s²·m·s)/(kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s)/ (kg·m/s) = m. So, the units work out for wavelength. So, that does make sense.

Alternatively, if I think about the speed of light, c, which has units of m/s. If I were to relate momentum and wavelength using c, the units wouldn't quite work out. For instance, if I had c multiplied by something, it would give units of m/s, which doesn't match wavelength's units of meters. So, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is lambda equals h over (m*v), where v is velocity. So, then the equation becomes lambda = h/(m*v). In that case, is the speed of light involved? No, because v is just the velocity of the particle, not necessarily the speed of light. Unless in some specific case v is c, but the question says it's a free massive particle, so I don't think it's necessarily moving at the speed of light.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe the question is mixing up different constants? Or perhaps I'm misremembering the hypothesis. Let me look it up in my notes. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but I can try to recall. De Broglie's equation is definitely lambda = h/p, right? So, p is momentum, which is mass times velocity. So, lambda = h/(m*v). So, the constant is h, Planck's constant.

But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Maybe they're thinking about Compton wavelength? Let me think. The Compton wavelength is given by lambda = h/(m*c), where c is the speed of light. So, in that case, the constant involved is h and c. But that's for the Compton wavelength, not De Broglie's wavelength. De Broglie's is about any particle, not specifically photons or electrons in Compton scattering.

So, maybe the confusion is between De Broglie's wavelength and Compton wavelength. If the question is about De Broglie, then it's Planck's constant. If it's about Compton, then it's Planck's constant and speed of light. But the question specifically mentions De Broglie's hypothesis, so it should be Planck's constant.

But the user says the correct answer is D. Perhaps the question was misworded, or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to relativistic momentum, where momentum is gamma*m*v, but even then, the formula would still involve h, not c.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is referring to wave-particle duality in a different context, like photons. For photons, the wavelength is related to their momentum by lambda = h/(p), but since photons also have energy E = pc, so p = E/c. Therefore, lambda = h*c/E. But again, that's for photons. For massive particles, De Broglie's equation is lambda = h/p, without involving c.

So, in that case, for a photon, both Planck's constant and speed of light are involved, but for a massive particle, only Planck's constant is involved. Therefore, the answer should be A, Planck's constant.

But the user says the correct answer is D. Maybe the question is incorrect or the options are mixed up. Alternatively, maybe I'm forgetting something. Let me try to reason differently.

Suppose we have a free particle with mass, moving at some velocity. Its linear momentum p is m*v. Its wavelength is h/p. So, lambda = h/(m*v). So, the relationship involves h. So, the constant is h, which is Planck's constant.

Alternatively, if the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we might use relativistic momentum, which is gamma*m*v. Then, lambda = h/(gamma*m*v). But still, the constant involved is h. So, unless the question is specifically considering relativistic effects and equating gamma*m*v to something involving c, but I don't see how that would tie c into the constant.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the relation uses the speed of light implicitly. For example, if the particle is free and we're considering natural units where c=1, but that seems like a stretch. It's more likely that the question is mistakenly pointing to D instead of A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that in some contexts, like when dealing with relativistic energies, the relation between wavelength and momentum could involve the speed of light. But I don't think that's the case for De Broglie's original hypothesis.

So, going back, De Broglie's hypothesis is lambda = h/p, so the constant is Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But the user says the correct answer is D. Maybe they made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the relationship between energy and wavelength. For photons, E = hc/lambda. But that's not De Broglie's hypothesis for massive particles. De Broglie's is about momentum and wavelength.

Alternatively, if the question is about the Compton wavelength, which is lambda = h/(m*c), then it's both h and c. But again, that's not De Broglie's.

I think I need to conclude that the correct answer should be A, Planck's constant, because De Broglie's equation is lambda = h/p. So, the constant relating momentum and wavelength is h. Therefore, the answer provided by the user might be incorrect or there's a misunderstanding.

But since the user insists the answer is D, the speed of light, maybe I should consider why someone would think that. Perhaps they confuse De Broglie's hypothesis with the relativistic relation where momentum is gamma*m*v, but even then, h is still the constant. Or maybe they think that because wavelength is related to velocity, which is a fraction of c, but that's not directly the constant.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relativistic expression for momentum in terms of wavelength, but I can't think of a standard formula that would involve c as the constant relating p and lambda. It's more likely that h is the constant.

In summary, I'm pretty sure the correct answer is A, Planck's constant, because De Broglie's equation directly uses h. The speed of light is involved in other contexts, like Compton wavelength or relativistic energy calculations, but not in the basic De Broglie hypothesis for a free massive particle's wavelength and momentum.
</think>

The correct answer to the question regarding De Broglie's hypothesis is A, Planck’s constant. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength (λ) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) by the equation λ = h/p, where h is Planck’s constant. This equation directly involves Planck’s constant, making it the correct choice. The speed of light (c) is not part of this fundamental relationship unless in specific contexts like the Compton wavelength, which is beyond De Broglie's original hypothesis. Therefore, the answer provided as D is incorrect for this question.

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this question about De Broglie's hypothesis. The question is asking about the relationship between the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle, and which constant is involved. The options are Planck's, Boltzmann's, Rydberg's, and the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be the speed of light, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall what De Broglie's hypothesis states. From what I remember, De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties, similar to light. So he suggested that every particle has a wavelength associated with it. The formula, if I recall correctly, relates the wavelength λ to the momentum p of the particle. 

I think the formula is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant. Wait, but the question is about which constant relates momentum and wavelength. So in this case, it's Planck's constant, right? Because h is the constant in the equation. But the answer given is the speed of light. That's confusing me.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different formulas. Let me think. I know that for photons, which are massless particles, the energy E is related to their wavelength by E = hc / λ, where c is the speed of light. But for massive particles, De Broglie's relation is λ = h / p. So the constant there is Planck's constant, not the speed of light.

Hmm, so why does the answer say speed of light? Is there another relation that involves the speed of light? Maybe if we're considering relativistic speeds, but I don't think that's the case here. The question specifies a free massive particle, which I think refers to a non-relativistic particle. 

Wait, could it be that the question is referring to the relativistic relation where momentum p is related to mass and velocity, but even then, the De Broglie wavelength is still λ = h / p. So the constant involved is still Planck's. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is confusing De Broglie's hypothesis with another concept, like the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength is given by λ = h / (m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's different from De Broglie's wavelength. De Broglie's is λ = h / p, regardless of the speed of light.

Wait, unless in some contexts, when considering the rest mass energy, E = mc², but that's energy, not directly related to the wavelength in De Broglie's formula. 

I'm getting more confused. Let me check my notes. Okay, De Broglie's hypothesis: particles have wavelength λ = h / p. So the constant is h, Planck's constant. So the correct answer should be A, not D. 

But the question says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says the linear momentum and wavelength are related by which constant. So maybe it's not just the formula λ = h / p, but another relation that involves c?

Wait, in the case of relativistic particles, momentum p is gamma*m*v, but even then, the De Broglie wavelength is still h/(gamma*m*v). Still, it doesn't involve the speed of light unless we're relating it to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mistaken. Or perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think about other constants. The Rydberg constant is related to atomic spectra, and Boltzmann's constant is related to thermal physics. So they don't fit here.

Maybe the confusion comes from the photoelectric effect, where Planck's constant is used with the speed of light in the equation E = hc / λ. But that's for photons, not massive particles. 

Wait, could the question be referring to the relationship between momentum and frequency? Like E = h f, and since E is also pc for photons, but again, that's for light. For massive particles, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², but that's energy, not directly the wavelength.

I'm getting stuck here. The initial formula I remember is λ = h / p, so Planck's constant. But the answer is speed of light. Maybe the correct answer is actually Planck's constant, and the given answer is wrong. Or perhaps the question is worded differently. 

Wait, let me read the question again: "the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So it's asking which constant relates p and λ. The formula is p = h / λ, so h is the constant. So the answer should be A, Planck's constant.

But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Maybe the question was not stated correctly. Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, when considering relativistic momentum, there's a relation involving c, but I don't think so. 

Wait, in the relativistic case, momentum p = gamma*mv, but the De Broglie wavelength is still λ = h/(gamma m v). So even relativistically, it's still h over p, so Planck's constant is involved, not c.

I'm starting to think that the correct answer should be Planck's constant, so the given answer might be incorrect. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe it's referring to the Compton wavelength, which does involve c, but that's a different concept from De Broglie's wavelength.

Alternatively, if the particle is moving at the speed of light, but then it wouldn't be massive, as per special relativity. So that can't be it.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer should be Planck's constant, so maybe the given answer is wrong or there's a mistake in the question. But since the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light, I must be missing something. Perhaps I need to re-examine the original hypothesis.

Wait, maybe De Broglie's hypothesis was that the momentum is related to the frequency or something else involving c. But no, the standard relation is wavelength and momentum. 

I'm stuck. Based on my understanding, it's Planck's constant. But the answer is speed of light. Maybe I should go with the given answer and see if I can find a reason, even if it's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing De Broglie's wavelength with another concept that involves the speed of light, like the de Broglie relation in a different form. But I can't think of any such form.

Wait, another thought: in some contexts, the momentum p is related to the frequency f by E = h f = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ). But that's energy, not directly relating p and λ. 

No, that doesn't seem relevant. So I think the answer should be Planck's constant. Maybe the given answer is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question was about a photon, but it specifies a massive particle.

Wait, unless the question is referring to the relativistic relation where p = gamma m v, and c is involved in gamma, but even then, in De Broglie's formula, it's still h over p, so Planck's constant is the key.

I'm going to have to conclude that the correct answer should be Planck's constant, so perhaps the given answer is wrong. But since the user says the answer is D, I might need to accept that and try to see why.

Wait, maybe in the original question, it's not De Broglie's hypothesis but another relation. Or maybe it's a trick question. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which is λ = h/(m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's not De Broglie's; that's Compton's.

So, if the question mistakenly refers to the Compton wavelength, then c would be the answer. But the question specifically says De Broglie's hypothesis, so that can't be.

I think I have to stick with my original understanding: De Broglie's relates p and λ via Planck's constant. So unless there's a misunderstanding, the answer should be A. But since the user says it's D, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the proportionality constant, and in the equation λ = h / p, the constant is h, which is Planck's. So the answer is A.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is Planck's constant, so the given answer might be incorrect. But the user insists it's D. Maybe the question was about the Compton wavelength, which does involve c. But the question says De Broglie's hypothesis, so that seems inconsistent.

In any case, I think I've thought through all possibilities and can't find a reason why the speed of light would be the answer for De Broglie's relation. Unless there's a different interpretation, but I can't think of it.
</think>

The correct answer to the question regarding De Broglie's hypothesis is Planck's constant. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength λ of a particle is related to its momentum p by the equation λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant. Therefore, the constant involved is Planck's constant, not the speed of light. It's possible there may be a misunderstanding or error in the original question stating the speed of light as the correct answer.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about De Broglie's hypothesis. The question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, Rydberg's constant, and the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light, but I'm trying to understand why that's the case.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. This is the wave-particle duality concept. So, he suggested that each particle has a wavelength associated with it, just like a wave does. The formula that relates the wavelength to the momentum of the particle is something I think I've heard before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

I believe the formula is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the linear momentum of the particle. Wait, but that would mean Planck's constant is the one connecting wavelength and momentum. So why is the answer speed of light then? Maybe I'm confusing something here.

Let me think again. The formula is lambda = h / p. So, h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So, if the question is about the constant that relates momentum and wavelength, it's Planck's constant, right? So why is the answer speed of light? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to relativistic considerations. I know that in special relativity, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass involves the speed of light. The energy E is related to momentum p by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So, if a particle's momentum is involved, the speed of light might come into play, but I'm not sure how that ties into De Broglie's hypothesis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up different formulas or constants. Let me check the formula again. De Broglie's relation is definitely lambda = h / p. So, the constant involved is Planck's constant, which is option A. So why is the answer D? Maybe the question is incorrect or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the relativistic momentum. In relativity, momentum p is gamma times m times v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But De Broglie's hypothesis is applicable in both classical and relativistic contexts, but the basic relation still uses Planck's constant.

I'm confused because I know that in the formula, h is Planck's constant. So, unless the question is referring to something else, like the Compton wavelength or something else that involves the speed of light, but De Broglie's original hypothesis is just lambda = h/p.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. It says "the linear momentum and wavelength are related by which constant." So, if De Broglie's formula is lambda = h / p, then h is the constant. So, the answer should be Planck's constant, which is option A.

But the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relativistic form where momentum is related to other constants. Let me think. If we have E = h f, and E is also gamma m c^2, then combining these gives f = gamma m c^2 / h. But that's more about frequency than wavelength.

Wait, in the relativistic case, the momentum p is gamma m v, and the wavelength is h/(gamma m v). So, the speed of light c might not directly come into play unless we're considering the relationship between momentum and energy, but De Broglie's relation is purely lambda = h/p, regardless of relativity.

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, like when dealing with photons, which are massless, the momentum is p = E/c, and since E = h f, then p = h f / c. But that's for photons, not massive particles. For massive particles, it's still lambda = h/p.

So, unless the question is referring to something else, perhaps the original De Broglie equation doesn't involve the speed of light. Therefore, the correct constant should be Planck's constant, option A.

But the user says the answer is D. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the original question again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So, the formula is lambda = h / p, so the constant is h, Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Unless the question is using a different formulation, like in terms of angular momentum or something else. But I don't recall De Broglie's hypothesis involving the speed of light.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is confused between De Broglie's wavelength and Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength is lambda = h/(m c), which does involve the speed of light. But De Broglie's is lambda = h/p, which doesn't necessarily involve c unless p is expressed in terms of velocity, like p = gamma m v, but that's still not directly c unless the particle is moving at a significant fraction of c.

But the question specifies "a free massive particle," which could be moving relativistically, but the basic De Broglie relation is still lambda = h/p, regardless of velocity. So, unless the question is incorrect, I'm confused why the answer would be speed of light.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relativistic form where p = gamma m v, and if v approaches c, but that's not directly part of the De Broglie equation itself.

I'm starting to think that maybe the correct answer is Planck's constant, and perhaps the user is mistaken. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a source that has a typo or is incorrect.

Wait, let me think about units. Planck's constant has units of J·s, which is kg·m²/s. Momentum p has units of kg·m/s. So, h/p has units of m, which is correct for wavelength. So, the formula lambda = h/p makes sense dimensionally. So, h is the constant connecting lambda and p.

If the speed of light were involved, the units would have to be consistent. For example, if the formula were lambda = h c / p, then units would be (J·s·m/s) / (kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s²·m/s) / (kg·m/s) = (kg·m²/s²) / (kg·m/s²) ) = m, which also works. But De Broglie's formula doesn't include c, so that's unnecessary.

Therefore, I think the correct answer should be Planck's constant, option A. So, why does the user say the answer is D, the speed of light? Maybe there's a mistake in the question or the answer key. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confusing it with another formula, like E = mc², but that's energy-mass equivalence, not directly related to De Broglie's wavelength.

In conclusion, based on De Broglie's hypothesis, the constant relating momentum and wavelength is Planck's constant. Therefore, the correct answer should be A, not D. Maybe the question intended to ask about a different relationship that involves the speed of light, but as per De Broglie, it's Planck's constant.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is Planck's constant (A). De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength λ of a particle is related to its momentum p by the formula λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. Therefore, the constant involved is Planck's constant, not the speed of light. It seems there may have been a misunderstanding or error in the original question or answer key. 

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to understand why the correct answer to this question is D. The speed of light. The question is about De Broglie's hypothesis relating linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. I remember that De Broglie proposed the wave-particle duality, suggesting that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. 

I think the key formula here is the De Broglie wavelength, which I believe is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. So, lambda equals h divided by (mass times velocity). That formula connects the wavelength with the momentum, which includes mass and velocity. 

Wait, but the question is asking which constant relates linear momentum and wavelength. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s, Rydberg’s, or speed of light. I know that in the formula, h is Planck's constant, so why is the answer speed of light?

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength are related by which constant. The formula is lambda = h / p. So h is Planck's constant, so that would suggest the answer is A. Planck’s constant.

But the user says the correct answer is D. Speed of light. That doesn't make sense because in the formula, it's h over p, not c. Unless maybe the question is referring to relativistic momentum? Let me think. In relativity, momentum p is gamma times m times v, but that doesn't introduce the speed of light into the De Broglie relation directly. Wait, unless in some other context, like when dealing with particles at relativistic speeds, but even then, the formula would still be lambda = h / (gamma m v), so the speed of light isn't directly a factor unless you're expressing gamma in terms of c, but that's not part of the De Broglie equation itself.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Compton wavelength, which is another concept. The Compton wavelength is lambda equals h divided by (m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's different from the De Broglie wavelength, which is lambda equals h/p. So if the question is about De Broglie, it's h, not c. But if it's about Compton, it's c. So perhaps the confusion is between the two.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. It says "the linear momentum and wavelength are related by which constant." The De Broglie relation is lambda = h / p. So h is Planck's constant. Therefore, the answer should be A. So why is the correct answer D?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different formulas. Let me check. De Broglie's hypothesis is that any particle has a wavelength associated with it, given by lambda = h / p. So h is Planck's constant, so that would mean the constant relating momentum and wavelength is h, which is Planck's constant. So the answer should be A, not D.

But the user says the correct answer is D. So maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is not about the De Broglie wavelength but about another relation. Or maybe it's a trick question. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering relativistic energy, where E = pc, but that's when the particle is massless, like a photon. But for a massive particle, E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v. So maybe in some contexts, c comes into play, but in the De Broglie relation, it's still lambda = h / p, which doesn't involve c.

Wait, but if we consider the relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v, and gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). But that's still not directly part of the De Broglie equation. So unless the question is implying that because momentum involves gamma, which involves c, but that seems like a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is confusing De Broglie's hypothesis with the relation in special relativity where E = mc^2, but that's energy, not momentum. So I'm a bit confused why the answer would be D. Maybe the user made a mistake in the answer.

Wait, let's think again. The question is about De Broglie's hypothesis. The formula is lambda = h / p. So the constant is h, which is Planck's constant. So the correct answer should be A. So either the user is mistaken, or perhaps the question is phrased differently. Unless the question is referring to the Compton wavelength, which uses c, but that's not De Broglie. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the relation between energy and wavelength, which would involve both h and c, but again, that's not De Broglie.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is considering the relativistic relation between momentum and wavelength, which could involve c. Let me see. If we have p = gamma m v, and we know that for a photon, E = pc, but that's different. For a massive particle, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ). But that's energy, not directly wavelength.

Wait, but De Broglie's relation is lambda = h / p, so unless we're expressing p in terms of something else that includes c, but that's not part of the original relation. So I'm still not convinced that the answer is D. Maybe it's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Compton wavelength, which is lambda = h / (m c). In that case, it's h over m c, but that's not De Broglie's formula. De Broglie's is h over p, where p is m v, not m c. So unless the particle is moving at speed c, which is not the case in general.

Wait, but if a particle is moving at speed v, then p = m v, so lambda = h / (m v). So unless v is the speed of light, which it's not necessarily. So I don't see how c comes into play here.

Therefore, I think the correct answer should be A. Planck's constant. So perhaps the user is mistaken, or maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different concept, but as per De Broglie's hypothesis, it's definitely h.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **A. Planck’s constant**. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength of a particle is given by the formula λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. This directly relates the wavelength to Planck's constant, not the speed of light. Therefore, the initial assertion that the correct answer is D (the speed of light) is incorrect.

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer to this question is D, the speed of light. The question is about De Broglie's hypothesis relating the linear momentum of a free massive particle to its wavelength. The options given are Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, Rydberg's constant, and the speed of light.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. This is part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. He suggested that each particle has a wavelength associated with its momentum. I think the formula he came up with is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the momentum. So that formula would mean that the relationship between momentum and wavelength involves Planck's constant.

But wait, the question is asking which constant relates linear momentum and wavelength. If the formula is lambda = h/p, then h is Planck's constant. So that would suggest the answer is A, Planck’s constant. But the correct answer is D, the speed of light. Hmm, that doesn't match my initial thought.

Maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. De Broglie's hypothesis is definitely lambda equals h over p. So in that formula, the constant is h. So why would the speed of light be the correct answer? That doesn't fit unless perhaps the question is referring to relativistic cases where momentum is related to the rest mass and velocity, which involves the speed of light.

Wait, in relativity, momentum p is gamma times m times v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, and v is velocity. But does that tie into the wavelength formula? The De Broglie wavelength is still lambda equals h over p, regardless of whether the particle is moving at relativistic speeds or not. So even in relativity, it's still Planck's constant that relates wavelength and momentum.

Unless the question is referring to another formula that involves the speed of light. For example, the Compton wavelength is lambda equals h over (m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's a different concept. The Compton wavelength is the wavelength associated with a particle's rest mass, not its momentum. So maybe the confusion is between De Broglie's wavelength and Compton wavelength.

So if the question is about linear momentum, it's De Broglie's formula, which uses Planck's constant. If it were about rest mass, it would be Compton's formula, which involves the speed of light. But the question specifically mentions linear momentum, so it should be De Broglie's formula with Planck's constant.

Wait, but the correct answer is given as D, the speed of light. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check some sources. De Broglie's hypothesis is definitely lambda equals h over p. So h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

On the other hand, the speed of light is a different constant, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. It's used in other formulas, like E=mc² or the Compton wavelength, but not directly in De Broglie's formula for momentum and wavelength.

So why is the answer D then? Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relativistic relation where momentum p is equal to gamma m v, and if you write lambda as h/(gamma m v), then perhaps bringing in c if v is a significant fraction of c. But even then, c isn't directly part of the De Broglie relation unless you express it in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the Compton wavelength and De Broglie wavelength. The Compton wavelength uses h/(m c), so it does involve the speed of light. But again, the question is about momentum, so it should be De Broglie's formula, which is h/p.

Wait, unless the question is phrased incorrectly or there's a trick. Maybe it's referring to the rest mass momentum, which would be zero if the particle is free? No, that doesn't make sense because a free particle still has momentum.

I'm a bit confused now. My initial thought is that Planck's constant is the right answer, but the given correct answer is speed of light. Maybe I should look up the exact statement of De Broglie's hypothesis to confirm.

Looking it up, De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength lambda is equal to h divided by the momentum p, so lambda = h/p. Therefore, the constant involved is Planck's constant. So unless the question is referring to a relativistic relation where p involves gamma and c, but even then, the direct relation is h/p, so h is still the constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not referring to the formula correctly. Maybe it's a trick question where the speed of light comes into play in another way, but I can't think of a scenario where, in De Broglie's original hypothesis, the speed of light is the constant relating momentum and wavelength.

Wait, maybe the confusion is because in some contexts, when dealing with wave-particle duality, the speed of light is involved in the wave's velocity, but De Broglie's wavelength is about the particle's wavelength, not the wave's velocity.

So, to sum up, I think the correct answer should be A, Planck’s constant, because De Broglie's formula directly uses h. But the given correct answer is D, the speed of light, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding or mistake in the question.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relativistic expression where momentum p is related to energy and mass via E = pc, but that's a different relation and still involves Planck's constant when considering photons. But for massive particles, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so p is related to v, not directly to c unless v is a significant fraction of c.

I'm still not sure why the speed of light would be the answer here. It might be a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing some key point. Without more context, I can't see why the speed of light would be the correct choice instead of Planck's constant.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is A, Planck’s constant. De Broglie's hypothesis states that the wavelength (λ) of a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum (p), expressed as λ = h/p, where h is Planck’s constant. Therefore, the constant relating linear momentum and wavelength in this context is Planck’s constant, not the speed of light. The confusion may arise from other formulas involving the speed of light, such as the Compton wavelength, but these are unrelated to the direct momentum-wavelength relationship in De Broglie's hypothesis. 

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer to this question is D, the speed of light. The question is about De Broglie's hypothesis and how it relates linear momentum to wavelength using a specific constant. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that particles like electrons have wave-like properties. This is the basis of wave-particle duality. His hypothesis introduced the concept that each particle has a wavelength associated with its momentum. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

I think the formula is lambda equals h over p, where lambda is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is momentum. So, lambda = h/p. If that's the case, then the relationship involves Planck's constant. But wait, the question is asking which constant relates linear momentum and wavelength. So, according to my memory, it's Planck's constant, which would make the answer A.

Hold on, but the user says the correct answer is D, the speed of light. That doesn't align with my initial thought. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

De Broglie's equation is definitely lambda equals h over p. So the constant involved is Planck's constant. But the options include the speed of light. Could there be another formula that relates momentum and wavelength involving the speed of light?

I recall that in special relativity, momentum is related to mass and velocity, with p = gamma mv, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But how does that tie into the wavelength?

Wait, maybe in some contexts, like when dealing with relativistic speeds, there's a relation that involves the speed of light. But De Broglie's original hypothesis was in the context of quantum mechanics, not relativity, so it should be using Planck's constant.

But perhaps the question is tricking me. Let me look up the exact formula to confirm. Okay, according to what I just checked, De Broglie's wavelength formula is indeed lambda = h/p. So, the constant is Planck's constant, which is option A.

But the user is asking why the correct answer is D, the speed of light. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Is there a scenario where the speed of light comes into play with momentum and wavelength?

I know that in the relativistic expression for momentum, p = gamma mv, and gamma involves the speed of light, but that's about momentum itself, not directly about the wavelength. The wavelength formula still uses Planck's constant.

Alternatively, could the question be referring to another equation where the speed of light is involved? For example, in the Compton wavelength, which is another concept. The Compton wavelength is given by lambda = h/(m c), where c is the speed of light. But that's a different concept because it's specific to the particle's mass and the speed of light, not the general momentum relationship.

So, in that case, the Compton wavelength uses the speed of light, but that's not De Broglie's original hypothesis. De Broglie's is more general and uses Planck's constant.

Therefore, I'm confused why the answer would be D. Unless the question is mixing up different concepts. Maybe the user made a mistake in the options or the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the exact wording again: "De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by which of the following constants?" So it's specifically about De Broglie's hypothesis, which is lambda = h/p. Thus, the constant is Planck's constant, so A.

I think there's a mistake here. The correct answer should be A, Planck’s constant, unless the question is referring to a different scenario where the speed of light is involved, but in the context of De Broglie's hypothesis, it's definitely Planck's constant.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is A. Planck’s constant. De Broglie's hypothesis relates the wavelength (λ) of a particle to its momentum (p) through the equation λ = h/p, where h is Planck’s constant. Therefore, the constant involved is Planck’s constant, not the speed of light. 

**Answer: A. Planck’s constant**
