[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why option C is the correct answer to the question: "Which of the following statements is not true?" The options are A, B, C, and D, and they all relate to syllogisms, specifically their formal and material validity. 

First, I need to understand what each option is saying and determine which one is not true. Let's break down each option one by one.

Option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." Hmm, I remember that a syllogism is a form of logical reasoning with two premises and a conclusion. Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism—whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises based on their logical structure. Material truth, on the other hand, is about the actual content and truth of the premises and conclusion.

So, if a syllogism is formally valid, that means its structure is correct, but the premises could still be false. For example, consider the classic invalid example: "All men are mortals. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates can fly." If the premises were true, the conclusion would follow, but here the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Wait, but in that case, the syllogism isn't formally valid because the conclusion doesn't logically follow. Maybe a better example would be a syllogism with false premises but a structure that's valid. For instance, "All Martians are green. Socrates is a Martian. Therefore, Socrates is green." If the premises are false (since Martians don't exist), but the structure is correct, the syllogism is formally valid but the conclusion is false. So, yeah, A seems true because a formally valid syllogism can have a false conclusion if the premises are false.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Wait, this is saying that if a syllogism is formally valid, then it must also be materially true. But from what I just thought about, that's not necessarily the case. Even if the structure is correct (formally valid), if the premises are false, the conclusion can still be false. So, a syllogism can be formally valid without being materially true. Therefore, B is not true because it's making a stronger claim that formal validity ensures material truth, which isn't the case.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So, this is saying that if you have a syllogism that's formally valid, it's possible for the conclusion to be true. That makes sense because if the premises are true and the structure is valid, the conclusion must be true. But even if the premises are false but the structure is still valid, the conclusion could be true by coincidence. For example, "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly." The syllogism is valid in structure, but the conclusion is false because penguins can't fly. Wait, that's a false conclusion. Maybe another example: "All dogs are mammals. A lab is a dog. Therefore, a lab is a mammal." Here, both premises are true, so the conclusion is true. So, a formally valid syllogism can result in a true conclusion if the premises are true. Alternatively, even if the premises are false, but the conclusion happens to be true because of the structure, it's still possible. So, yes, C is true because a formally valid syllogism can lead to a true conclusion.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This is similar to what I thought earlier. Formal validity only ensures the structure is correct, not the truth of the premises. So, even if the syllogism is formally valid, if the premises are false, the conclusion could be false. Therefore, formal validity doesn't ensure material truth. So, D is true.

So, to recap:

- A is true because a valid syllogism can have false premises leading to a false conclusion.
- B is not true because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.
- C is true because a valid syllogism can have a true conclusion if premises are true or by coincidence.
- D is true because formal validity doesn't guarantee the premises are true.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is NOT true. So, if B is not true, why is the correct answer C? That doesn't make sense because according to my analysis, B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go back.

The question is: Which statement is NOT true.

Option B says: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true."

But as I thought earlier, a syllogism can be formally valid but not materially true because the premises might be false, making the conclusion false. Therefore, B is not true. So, why is the correct answer C?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, the question is asking which statement is NOT true.

From my analysis, B is the statement that is not true because a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be materially true. A is true because it's possible for a valid syllogism to be untrue. C is true because a valid syllogism can lead to a true conclusion. D is true because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.

Wait, but the user said the correct answer is C, which contradicts my analysis. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing material validity with formal validity. Let me check definitions.

Formal validity: The structure of the syllogism is such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

Material validity: The actual content is true, meaning the premises and conclusion are factually correct.

So, a syllogism can be formally valid but have false premises, making it not materially true. It can also be formally valid with true premises, making it both formally and materially valid.

So, looking at the options:

A: A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. This is true because if the premises are false, the syllogism is still formally valid but not materially true.

B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. This is false because, as above, premises could be false.

C: A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. This is true because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. So, yes, a true conclusion can arise.

D: Formal validity doesn't guarantee material truth. True, because as in A, it's possible for the premises to be false.

So, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, but the user says it's C. Maybe the user made a mistake in their initial answer.

Wait, perhaps the user is correct, and I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think again.

The question is: Which statement is NOT true?

If all the options are talking about possibilities, perhaps C is saying that it's possible for a formally valid syllogism to have a true conclusion, which is obviously true because that's how syllogisms work when premises are true.

So, all options A, C, D are true, and B is not true. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

But the user says the correct answer is C, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the user's explanation is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the term "materially true" refers to the conclusion being true, regardless of the premises. So, even if the premises are false, the conclusion could be true. So, a formally valid syllogism could have a true conclusion even if the premises are false, which would mean that a true conclusion can arise from a formally valid syllogism, which is what C is saying. So, C is true.

But then, B is saying that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true, which is not the case because the conclusion could be false if the premises are false. So, B is not true. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps I'm misreading the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me check the original options again.

The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, the question is asking which statement is NOT true. So, the answer is B because it's making a false claim that formal validity ensures material truth, which it doesn't. Therefore, B is not true, making it the correct answer.

But the user says the correct answer is C, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused, or the options are presented differently.

In any case, based on my analysis, the statement that is not true is B, so the correct answer should be B. However, the user says the answer is C, so perhaps there's a mistake in the initial question or the user's understanding.

But to answer the user's question, they want to know why the correct answer is C. So, perhaps I need to align with that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see why C would be the correct answer.

Option C: A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

This is true because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. So, a true conclusion can arise. Therefore, C is a true statement, so it cannot be the answer because the question asks which is NOT true.

Wait, so if the question is asking which statement is NOT true, then the answer must be the false statement. So, the false statements are B and possibly others.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Let me list them again:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. (True)

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. (False)

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. (True)

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true. (True)

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B.

So, the correct answer is B, not C. Therefore, the user's initial answer is incorrect.

But since the user says the correct answer is C, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terminology.

Wait, perhaps "materially true" refers to the conclusion being true regardless of the premises. In that case, even if the premises are false, the conclusion might be true, making the syllogism's conclusion true, but the syllogism itself is not materially true because the premises are false.

Wait, but in that case, the syllogism would be formally valid but not materially valid because the premises are false.

So, the conclusion could be true, making the syllogism's conclusion true, but the syllogism itself is not materially true because it's based on false premises.

Therefore, C is saying that a true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism, which is possible. So, C is true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, as before.

I think the confusion arises from whether "materially true" refers to the syllogism as a whole or just the conclusion. If it's the syllogism as a whole, then B is false because the syllogism can have false premises and thus not be materially true. If it's referring to the conclusion being true, then C is possible.

But the question is about the statements being true or not. So, B is making a claim about the syllogism being necessarily materially true, which is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, not C.

But since the user says the correct answer is C, perhaps the question was misstated or there's a different interpretation.

In any case, based on standard logic, the answer should be B. However, since the user is asking why C is correct, I'll try to see if there's a way to interpret it that way.

Perhaps the user is thinking that C is the answer because it's the only statement that's not necessarily true, but that doesn't make sense because C is true.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and the correct answer is B.

So, to sum up, I believe the correct answer is B, but the user says it's C, so there might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the question.
</think>

The correct answer is **B**. A formally valid syllogism does not have to be materially true because the premises could be false, leading to a false conclusion. 

**Answer: B**
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. The question is asking which statement is **not** true. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should remember what a syllogism is. From what I recall, a syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The validity of a syllogism refers to the logical structure, not the actual truth of the content. So, a syllogism can be formally valid even if the premises are false, right?

Let me look at each option one by one.

**Option A: A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.**
Hmm, this makes sense. If the premises are factually incorrect, the syllogism is still valid if the logic follows correctly. For example, consider:
- All dragons are mythical creatures. (True, but wait, actually dragons are mythical, so maybe this is a bad example. Let me think of another.)
- All swans are white. (Actually, there are black swans, so that's false.)
- All white birds are swans.
- Therefore, all swans are white birds. (This is a syllogism, but the premises are false because not all white birds are swans and not all swans are white. Wait, that might not be the best example either. Maybe I should stick to the idea that validity is about form, not content.)

So, even if the syllogism is valid in form (the logical structure is correct), the content might be false. So A is saying that a formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. That seems true because the premises could be false but the logic still holds.

**Option B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.**
This seems like it might be the incorrect statement. Because, as I thought earlier, a syllogism can be valid in form but have false premises. So even if the logic is correct, the conclusion might not be true because the premises are false. Therefore, B is saying that if it's formally valid, it must be true, which isn't necessarily the case. So B might be the incorrect statement.

Wait, but the question is asking which is **not** true, so the incorrect statement would be the answer. But let me check the other options to be sure.

**Option C: A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.**
This seems to be saying that if the syllogism is valid, the conclusion can be true. That makes sense because if the premises are true and the logic is valid, the conclusion must be true. But wait, the option is saying "may arise," which implies possibility, not certainty. So even if the syllogism is valid, the conclusion could be true or false depending on the premises. Wait, no—if the syllogism is formally valid and the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So a valid syllogism with true premises will have a true conclusion. But if the premises are false, the conclusion could be false or even true by coincidence. But C is saying that a true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism, which is possible. So C is a true statement. Therefore, it's not the answer.

**Option D: The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.**
This seems correct because formal validity only ensures the structure is correct, not the truth of the content. So even if it's valid, the premises could be false, making the conclusion false. Therefore, D is a true statement, so it's not the answer.

Wait, going back to option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." So if a syllogism is valid in form, does it necessarily have to be true in content? I don't think so. Because if the premises are false, the conclusion could be false, even if the logic is correct. So B is making a claim that a valid syllogism must be true, which isn't necessarily the case. Therefore, B is the incorrect statement, making it the answer.

But wait, the user said the correct answer is C, but according to my analysis, B is the incorrect statement. Did I make a mistake?

Let me review. The question is asking which statement is **not** true. So the incorrect one.

Option C says that a true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. That's correct because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion must be true. So it's possible, so C is true.

Option B says that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. That's not necessarily the case because the premises could be false, making the conclusion false. Therefore, B is the statement that's not true, making it the correct answer to the question of which is not true.

Wait, but the user said the correct answer is C, but according to my reasoning, B is the incorrect statement. Maybe I need to double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the conclusion, not the syllogism itself. Let me read option C again: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So, can a valid syllogism lead to a true conclusion? Yes, if the premises are true. So C is correct. Therefore, the statement that's not true is B, because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true; it depends on the premises.

Wait, but in the question, the options are about the syllogism itself, not just the conclusion. So option B is saying that if the syllogism is formally valid, then it must be true (i.e., the conclusion must be true). That's not correct because the conclusion's truth depends on the premises, not just the validity of the form.

So, in that case, B is the statement that's not true, making it the correct answer. But the user said the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking back: The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So the question is which is **not** true. So the incorrect statement.

Option B says a valid syllogism must be true. But a valid syllogism can have false premises and thus a false conclusion. So B is incorrect, making it the answer.

Wait, but the user said the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the conclusion, but the options are about the syllogism.

Wait, option C is about the conclusion, while the others are about the syllogism as a whole.

So perhaps the question is which statement is not true. So if C is saying that a true conclusion may arise from a valid syllogism, that's correct. Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

But the user said the answer is C, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the user is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Option B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. So, if a syllogism is valid, does it have to be true? No, because validity is about the form, not the content. So B is false, making it the answer.

But the user said the correct answer is C, so perhaps they're mistaken. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is in Chinese, and the translation might be slightly off. The user provided the options in English as:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, according to this, the correct answer is C, but according to my analysis, B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the syllogism being true as a whole and the conclusion being true. Let me clarify.

A syllogism is a set of two premises and a conclusion. The syllogism is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The syllogism's material truth depends on the truth of the premises and the conclusion.

So, a syllogism can be formally valid (the conclusion follows from the premises) but the premises can be false, making the conclusion false. Therefore, a valid syllogism may not be true, so A is correct, B is incorrect.

C is correct because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion is true. So a true conclusion may arise from a valid syllogism.

D is correct because validity doesn't ensure the premises are true, so the conclusion might not be true.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B. So the correct answer should be B, not C.

But the user said the correct answer is C, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps in the original question, the options are different.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the conclusion's necessity rather than possibility.

Wait, option C says "may arise," which is correct because it's possible. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, so it's possible for the conclusion to be true.

Option B is incorrect because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true; it depends on the premises.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B, making it the correct answer to the question of which is not true.

But the user said the correct answer is C, so perhaps they made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the conclusion and the syllogism. Let me think again.

Option C: A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

This is true because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion must be true. So it's possible, so C is true.

Option B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. This is false because a syllogism can be valid with false premises, leading to a false conclusion.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B, making it the correct answer.

I think the user might have made a mistake in stating the correct answer as C, but according to logical analysis, B is the incorrect statement.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B**. A formally valid syllogism does not necessarily have to be materially true because its validity depends on the logical structure, not the truth of its premises. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Syllogisms:** A syllogism's validity is determined by its logical form, not the content of its premises or conclusion.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A:** Correct. A valid syllogism can have false premises, making it untrue.
   - **B:** Incorrect. A valid syllogism doesn't have to be true; its truth depends on the premises.
   - **C:** Correct. A valid syllogism with true premises leads to a true conclusion.
   - **D:** Correct. Validity doesn't ensure the syllogism's truth.

3. **Conclusion:** The statement that is not true is **B**.

**Answer:** The correct answer is **B**.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I'm supposed to figure out why the correct answer is C. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a syllogism is. From what I remember, a syllogism is a form of logical reasoning where a conclusion is drawn from two given premises. It has a structure like: All A are B, All C are A, therefore All C are B. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the only form. Maybe there are different types, but I think the basics are about the structure and validity.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true. The options are A, B, C, D. The given correct answer is C, but I want to make sure I understand why.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." Hmm. Formal validity refers to the structure being correct, regardless of the actual truth of the premises. So if the premises are true and the structure is correct, the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, even with a correct structure, the conclusion might be untrue. So a formally valid syllogism can have a conclusion that's false because the premises might be false. So A seems true because formal validity doesn't depend on the material truth of the premises.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Wait, if a syllogism is formally valid, that means the structure is correct, but the truth of the conclusion depends on the truth of the premises. If the premises are both true, then the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, the conclusion can still be valid in form but untrue in content. So does a formally valid syllogism must be materially true? I think this is where the confusion is. If the premises are true and the form is valid, then the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, the syllogism is still formally valid, but the conclusion is false. So does the statement B say that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true? That would be incorrect because the truth depends on the premises. So B is actually the statement that is NOT true, which would make B the correct answer. But wait, the correct answer is supposed to be C. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So this is saying that if you have a syllogism that's formally valid, it's possible for the conclusion to be true. That makes sense because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion must be true. So it's possible, so this statement is true. Therefore, C is a true statement, which is why it's not the correct answer since the question asks which is NOT true.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This seems to align with what I thought earlier. Formal validity is about structure, not about the truth of the premises. So even if the structure is correct, if the premises are false, the conclusion can be false. So D is a true statement.

Wait, so let me recap:

- A: True, because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.

- B: Claims that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. But this isn't the case because the premises could be false, making the conclusion false. So B is false.

- C: True, because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion is true.

- D: True, because formal validity doesn't guarantee the truth of the premises.

So the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." So if a syllogism is formally valid, does it have to be true in content? No, because the premises could be false. So a syllogism can be formally valid but have a false conclusion if the premises are false. So B is false, making it the correct answer to the question "which is NOT true."

But the user says the correct answer is C. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I confused the terms. Let's clarify:

- Formal validity: The structure is correct; if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

- Material truth: The actual content is true.

So a syllogism can be formally valid but have false premises, leading to a false conclusion. Therefore, a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be materially true because the premises might be false. So B is false.

Similarly, a formally valid syllogism with true premises will have a true conclusion, so C is saying it's possible, which is true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C.

But the user says the correct answer is C, so perhaps the options were different.

Wait, looking back, the user wrote: "The options are: A. ..., B. ..., C. ..., D. ... Why the correct answer is C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism?"

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT true, and the correct answer is C. But according to my analysis, C is true, so it's not the correct answer. So perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, let's re-examine the options:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, A is saying that a valid syllogism can be untrue, which is true because validity is about form, not content.

B is saying that a valid syllogism must be true, which is false because as I said, premises could be false.

C is saying that a true conclusion can come from a valid syllogism, which is true because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion is true.

D is saying that formal validity doesn't ensure material truth, which is true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. So the correct answer should be B, but the user says it's C. Maybe the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was phrased differently. Wait, the user wrote: "Which of the following statements is NOT true?" So the correct answer is C, but according to my analysis, C is true. So perhaps the user is mistaken.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe "formally valid syllogism must be materially true" (B) is actually true. Because if a syllogism is formally valid, meaning it's logically correct, then if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, the conclusion can be false. So the syllogism itself is valid, but the conclusion's truth depends on the premises. So a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be true; it's just that if the premises are true, the conclusion is true. So B is false because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true; it's only necessarily true if the premises are true.

Therefore, B is the statement that is NOT true, which would make B the correct answer. But the user says the correct answer is C, so perhaps the user is mistaken, or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the key is that a formally valid syllogism is one where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. So if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, the conclusion could be anything. So a formally valid syllogism can have a true or false conclusion depending on the premises. Therefore, A is true because it can be untrue, B is false because it doesn't have to be true, C is true because it can be true, and D is true because validity doesn't ensure truth.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. So the correct answer should be B, but the user says it's C. Maybe the user mixed up the options or there's a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if the user's reasoning makes sense. They say that C is the correct answer because a valid syllogism can produce a true conclusion. That's true, but it's not the statement that's not true. The question is which is NOT true, so C is true, so it's not the correct answer. The correct answer would be B, which is false.

Therefore, I think the user might have made a mistake in stating the correct answer. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: maybe "formally valid syllogism" is defined differently. Maybe in some contexts, a syllogism is only considered formally valid if the premises are true. But I don't think that's the case. Formal validity is about the structure, not the truth of the premises. So a syllogism can be valid in form regardless of the truth of its premises.

So, to sum up, I believe the correct answer is B, as it's the statement that is not true. Therefore, the user might have an error in stating the correct answer as C.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. This statement is not true because the formal validity of a syllogism refers only to the logical structure being correct, not the truth of the premises. Therefore, a syllogism can be formally valid yet materially untrue if the premises are false. 

However, if the premises are true and the syllogism is formally valid, the conclusion must be true. Thus, a formally valid syllogism can lead to a true conclusion (making statement C true), but it doesn't necessarily have to be true on its own (making statement B false).

Answer: B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is C. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. The options are A, B, C, D, and the correct answer is supposed to be C. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to remember what a syllogism is. From what I recall, a syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The structure is usually like: All A are B, All B are C, therefore All A are C. But syllogisms can vary in structure, and their validity depends on their form.

Now, the key concepts here are formal validity and material truth. Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism. If the syllogism is formally valid, it means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. It's about the logical form, not the actual content. Material truth, on the other hand, refers to the actual truth of the statements. So, even if a syllogism is formally valid, the premises might be factually incorrect, making the conclusion untrue in reality.

Let me look at each option:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.
- This sounds plausible. If the premises are factually incorrect, the conclusion, even if logically derived, could be untrue. For example, "All swans are white. All birds are swans. Therefore, all birds are white." The first premise is false (not all swans are white), so the conclusion is false. But the syllogism is valid because the form is correct. So A is true.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.
- Wait, this seems tricky. If the syllogism is valid, does it mean the conclusion must be true? I think no, because the truth depends on the premises. If the premises are false, the conclusion can still be valid in form but untrue in content. So B is saying that a valid syllogism must have a true conclusion, which isn't necessarily the case. So B might be the incorrect statement, making it the answer. But hold on, let me check the other options.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.
- This is saying that if you have a valid syllogism, the conclusion could be true. Well, if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, then the conclusion must be true. So it's possible, but does it say "may"? So, yes, a valid syllogism with true premises leads to a true conclusion, so a true conclusion may arise. So C is true.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.
- This aligns with what I thought earlier. Just because the form is valid doesn't mean the content is true. So D is true.

So, looking back, option B says a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. But that's not necessarily the case because the premises could be false. Therefore, B is the statement that's not true. But the user said the correct answer is C. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, option C says a true conclusion may arise. So, if a syllogism is formally valid, it's possible for the conclusion to be true. That's correct because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion must be true. So C is stating a possibility, which is accurate. So then why is C the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So the correct answer is the false statement.

Option B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. This is false because a valid syllogism can have false premises, leading to a false conclusion. So B is not true.

But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Material truth of the conclusion—so if a syllogism is formally valid, can its conclusion be true? Yes, because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true. So C is saying it's possible, which is correct. Therefore, C is true, so it's not the answer.

Then, B is the statement that's not true because a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be materially true. So why is the answer C? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the wording. "May arise" in C. So it's saying it's possible, which is correct. So C is true. Therefore, the false statement is B.

But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read the question again.

The question is: Which of the following statements is NOT true.

Options:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. True, as discussed.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. False, because it might have false premises.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. True, because if premises are true, conclusion is true.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true. True, because validity is about form, not content.

So the false statement is B. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Wait, perhaps "materially true conclusion" refers only to the conclusion being true, regardless of the premises. So C is saying that from a valid syllogism, you can get a true conclusion. But that's only if the premises are true. If the premises are false, the conclusion can still be valid in form but false in content. So C is saying it's possible, which is correct. Therefore, C is true.

So, the incorrect statement is B, which claims that a valid syllogism must be true. It doesn't have to be, so B is false.

But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe the options are different. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, if C is saying that a true conclusion may arise, which is correct because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true. So C is a true statement, not the false one.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe "materially true conclusion" in C refers to the conclusion being true regardless of the premises. But that's not the case. The conclusion can only be true if the premises are true. So C is saying that it's possible, which is correct, so it's true.

Therefore, the answer should be B, which is false. So I'm confused why the user says the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, and I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the question is about the converse: whether a true conclusion implies a valid syllogism. But that's not what C is saying. C is about a valid syllogism leading to a true conclusion, which is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the options are different. Let me check the original question again.

The user wrote: The options are: A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue, B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true, C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism, D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true. Why the correct answer is C.

Wait, but according to this, the correct answer is C, but from my analysis, B is the false statement. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about necessary versus possible. Let me think again.

A syllogism is formally valid if the premises are structured correctly. Material truth depends on the actual facts.

So:

A. Valid syllogism may be untrue. True, because premises could be false.

B. Valid syllogism must be true. False, because premises could be false.

C. True conclusion may arise from valid syllogism. True, because if premises are true, conclusion is true.

D. Validity doesn't guarantee truth. True, because truth depends on premises.

So the false statement is B, making B the correct answer, not C.

Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Wait, maybe "materially true conclusion" in C implies that the conclusion is true regardless of the premises, but that's not the case. The conclusion's truth depends on the premises. So C is saying it's possible for the conclusion to be true if the premises are true, which is correct. Therefore, C is true.

So, the answer should be B, not C.

But the user says the correct answer is C, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, another angle: A syllogism can be valid but have a false conclusion if the premises are false. So C is saying that a true conclusion may arise from a valid syllogism, which is true because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

Therefore, C is true, so it's not the answer. B is the false statement.

I'm confident that B is the false statement, so perhaps the user has an error in their provided answer.
</think>

The correct answer is B. A formally valid syllogism does not necessarily have to be materially true because its truth depends on the actual content of the premises, which can be false.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is C in this multiple-choice question about syllogisms. The question is asking which statement is not true. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying and then determine which one isn't true. Let's start by recalling what a syllogism is. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The focus here is on formal validity and material truth.

Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism. If a syllogism is formally valid, it means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's about the logical form, not the actual content. Material truth, on the other hand, refers to the actual content or facts. So, a syllogism can be formally valid but have premises that are factually untrue, leading to a conclusion that's also untrue.

Now, let's analyze each option:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.  
This makes sense because formal validity is about structure, not truth. Even if the premises are false, the syllogism can still be formally valid. For example, consider the syllogism: All swans are green. All geese are swans. Therefore, all geese are green. Structurally, it's valid (if the premises were true, the conclusion would follow), but the premises and conclusion are false, making it materially untrue. So, A is true.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.  
This is tricky. The key here is the word "must." If a syllogism is formally valid, does it necessarily make it materially true? No, because the premises could be false. Like in the example above, the syllogism is valid, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, B is not necessarily true. In fact, B seems to be the statement that's not true, but wait, the correct answer is supposed to be C. Hmm, maybe I need to consider this more carefully.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.  
This means that if you have a syllogism that's structured correctly (formally valid) and the premises are true, then the conclusion will be true. So, this is essentially saying that a valid syllogism with true premises leads to a true conclusion, which is the definition of formal validity. Therefore, C is true because it's a restatement of the principle.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.  
This is similar to option A but phrased differently. It's saying that just because a syllogism is valid in structure doesn't mean it's true in content. This is correct because, again, the premises could be false. So, D is true.

Wait, but the original question says the correct answer is C. But based on my analysis, B seems to be the incorrect statement because it claims that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true, which isn't necessarily the case. However, C is actually true because a valid syllogism with true premises will have a true conclusion.

Maybe I got confused because the question asks which statement is NOT true. So, if C is true, then it cannot be the answer. The incorrect statements would be B because it's making a stronger claim that formal validity necessitates material truth, which isn't always the case. So, perhaps the correct answer should be B, not C.

But wait, the user says the correct answer is C. That must mean I'm misunderstanding something. Let me re-examine.

C says a materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. So, it's not saying that it must, but that it may. That is, it's possible for a valid syllogism to have a true conclusion. Which is correct because if the premises are true, the conclusion will follow. So, C is true.

Then, looking back at B: A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. This is saying that if a syllogism is valid, it must be true in content. But validity doesn't care about the truth of the premises; it only cares about the structure. So, if the premises are false, the conclusion can still be validly drawn, but it will be false. Therefore, B is making a false claim, which would be the statement that's not true.

But the user says the correct answer is C, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the relationship between material truth and formal validity.

Another angle: The question is about which statement is NOT true. So, if C is not true, then it would mean that a materially true conclusion cannot arise from a formally valid syllogism, which is false because it can. Therefore, C is true, so it cannot be the answer. Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.

Wait, but the user insists that the correct answer is C. Maybe I need to look at the wording again.

Option C: A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

Is this necessarily true? Well, yes, because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion must be true. So, it's possible, hence "may arise." Therefore, C is true.

So, going back, the statements:

A: True  
B: False  
C: True  
D: True

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.  
B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.  
C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.  
D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So, A is true because a valid syllogism can have false premises and a false conclusion. B is false because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true in content. C is true because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion is true. D is true because formal validity doesn't ensure the premises are true.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT true is B, not C. So, perhaps the user made a mistake in stating that the correct answer is C. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting something.

Alternatively, perhaps "materially true conclusion" in C is being misapplied. Let me think about it differently. If a syllogism is formally valid but has false premises, the conclusion is necessarily false. But if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. So, a formally valid syllogism can lead to a true conclusion only if the premises are true. Therefore, it's possible for a valid syllogism to have a true conclusion, but it's not guaranteed. So, C says "may arise," which is correct because it's possible. Therefore, C is true.

So, the statement that is not true is B because it claims that a valid syllogism must be true, which is not the case. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not C. Maybe the user had a typo or confusion in the options.

But since the user says the correct answer is C, I must reconcile that. Perhaps there's a nuance I'm missing. Let me see.

Wait, maybe the question is about the conclusion, not the entire syllogism. So, B says the syllogism must be true, which relates to the conclusion. But C is about the conclusion arising from a valid syllogism. So, perhaps the confusion is about the syllogism's truth versus the conclusion's truth.

But regardless, based on the analysis, B is the incorrect statement, making it the answer to the question of which is NOT true. Therefore, unless there's a specific nuance I'm missing, I think the correct answer should be B, not C. Maybe the user is mistaken.

However, since the user is asking why the correct answer is C, perhaps I need to accept that and explain why C is correct, even though my analysis suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, a formally valid syllogism is defined as one where the premises are true, but that's not standard. Typically, formal validity is independent of the truth of premises. Therefore, a valid syllogism can have a false conclusion if the premises are false.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B because it claims that a valid syllogism must be true, which is incorrect. C is true because a valid syllogism can have a true conclusion if the premises are true.

So, in conclusion, I think the correct answer is B, but perhaps the user has a different interpretation. I'll proceed with the understanding that the correct answer is B, but if I have to explain why C is correct, I'll do that as well.
</think>

The correct answer to the question is **B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true** because this statement is not true. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Formal Validity vs. Material Truth**: A syllogism's formal validity concerns its logical structure, ensuring that if the premises are true, the conclusion must follow. Material truth refers to the actual content or facts.

2. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: True. A valid syllogism can have false premises and a false conclusion, making it materially untrue.
   - **B**: False. Validity doesn't guarantee the premises are true; thus, the syllogism doesn't "must" be true.
   - **C**: True. If a syllogism is valid and premises are true, the conclusion is true.
   - **D**: True. Validity doesn't ensure the premises are true.

3. **Conclusion**: The incorrect statement is **B**, as formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer to this logic question is C. The question is asking which statement is not true, and the options are about syllogisms being formally valid and whether they're also materially true. 

First, I need to understand the terms here. A syllogism is a form of logical reasoning where a conclusion is drawn from two given premises. Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism—whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises based on their logical form, regardless of the actual truth of the premises. Material truth, on the other hand, is about whether the premises and the conclusion are factually correct.

Looking at the options:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.
B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.
C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.
D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

I remember that a syllogism can be formally valid even if the premises are false. For example, consider the classic "All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal." That's valid and true. But if you change it to something like "All men are gods, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is a god," the form is still valid, but the conclusion is false because the premises are false. So A is true because a valid syllogism can indeed have false content.

Option B says that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. I think this is not necessarily the case because, as I just thought, the premises could be false. So B might be the incorrect statement, but the answer is supposed to be C, so maybe I'm missing something.

Option C says a materially true conclusion can come from a formally valid syllogism. Well, that makes sense because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion must be true. So C is definitely true. 

Option D states that formal validity doesn't ensure material truth. Yes, that's correct because, as in my example, the structure can be correct, but the facts might be wrong.

Wait, so going back, the question is asking which is NOT true. So if B says a valid syllogism must be true, but we know that's not the case—it can be valid but have false premises leading to a false conclusion—then B is the incorrect statement. But the answer is supposed to be C, so maybe I'm mixing up something.

Hold on, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The question is which is NOT true. So if C is true, it's not the answer. The answer is C, meaning it's true, but the question is about which is not true. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, wait. The correct answer is C, meaning C is the statement that is not true. But according to my reasoning, C is actually true because a valid syllogism with true premises will have a true conclusion. So why is the answer C?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question is which statement is NOT true. So if all options are true except one, which is false. So if A is true, B is false, C is true, D is true, then B is the incorrect statement. But the user says the correct answer is C, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe C is not necessarily always true. Wait, but if a syllogism is formally valid and has true premises, then the conclusion must be true. So a true conclusion can arise from a valid syllogism. So C is true. So then why is C the answer?

Wait, maybe the question is about which statement is not necessarily true. Let me think. If the syllogism is formally valid, it doesn't necessarily have to have true premises. So the conclusion's truth depends on the premises. So a formally valid syllogism can have a true conclusion if the premises are true, or a false conclusion if the premises are false. So C says a true conclusion may arise, which is possible, not necessarily always, but it's possible. So C is true.

Looking back, the statements:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. That's true because the premises could be false.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. That's false because it can be valid with false premises, leading to a false conclusion.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. That's true because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

D. Formal validity doesn't guarantee material truth. That's true because, again, the premises might be false.

So the statement that's not true is B. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, the user said the correct answer is C because it's not necessarily true. But according to my analysis, C is true. So perhaps the confusion is between "may arise" and "must arise." C says "may," so it's possible, not that it must. So if the syllogism is valid and the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So "may" is correct because it's a possibility, not a certainty. So C is true.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B because a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be true. So perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the correct answer. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. - True.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. - False.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. - True.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true. - True.

So the statement that is not true is B. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. But the user says the answer is C. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user is correct in their answer, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the conclusion being true, but the syllogism being valid. So if the syllogism is valid, the conclusion's truth depends on the premises. So a true conclusion can come from valid syllogism with true premises, but it's not guaranteed if the premises are false. So C is still true because it's possible, not that it must happen.

So I think the answer should be B, but the user says it's C. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the wording. The question is which statement is NOT true. So if all options are true except one. If B says a valid syllogism must be true, which is false. So B is the incorrect statement, making B the answer. But the user says the answer is C, so perhaps I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, and I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the syllogism is valid, it can have a true conclusion if the premises are true, or a false conclusion if the premises are false. So C says a true conclusion may arise, which is possible, so it's true. Therefore, the statement that is not true is B, because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true.

So I think the correct answer is B, but the user says it's C. Maybe there's a mistake in the user's information. Alternatively, perhaps the question is different. Maybe the syllogism is valid but the conclusion is not necessarily true. So C is saying it's possible, which is true, so the statement that's not true would be B.

I think I've gone in circles here. Based on my reasoning, the answer should be B, but the user says it's C. I might need to go with B as the answer, but since the user says it's C, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the conclusion being true regardless of the premises, but that's not the case. I think I'll stick with my initial reasoning that B is the false statement.
</think>

The correct answer is B. A formally valid syllogism does not have to be materially true because its validity depends on logical structure, not the truth of its premises. A valid syllogism can have false premises, leading to a false conclusion, making B the statement that is not true.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is C. The question is asking which statement is not true, and the options are A, B, C, D. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what syllogisms are. From what I remember, a syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The structure is usually like: All A are B, All B are C, therefore All A are C. But syllogisms can vary in their structure and the types of premises they have.

Now, the key concepts here are formal validity and material truth. Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism. If a syllogism is formally valid, it means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's about the logical form, not the actual content. Material truth, on the other hand, pertains to whether the premises and conclusion are factually true.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." Hmm, so if a syllogism is valid in form, does it mean the conclusion has to be true? I think not necessarily. Because formal validity only ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion follows. But if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be either true or false. So even a valid syllogism can have a conclusion that's factually untrue because the premises might not be true. Therefore, A seems to be a true statement.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Wait, this sounds similar to A but with a different conclusion. If a syllogism is formally valid, does that mean it has to be true in material fact? I think not. Because formal validity doesn't care about the actual truth of the premises. The premises could be false, making the conclusion either true or false. So a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to be materially true. Therefore, B is not a true statement. But hold on, the question is asking which is NOT true, so if B is not true, it could be the answer. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So, can a valid syllogism lead to a conclusion that's actually true? Yes, of course. If the premises are true, and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion must be true. But even if the premises are false, the conclusion might still be true coincidentally. So it's possible for a formally valid syllogism to have a materially true conclusion. Therefore, C is a true statement.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This makes sense because formal validity only ensures the structure is correct, not whether the premises are actually true. So even if the syllogism is valid, the conclusion might not be true if the premises are false. Therefore, D is also a true statement.

So, going back, the options are:

A: True
B: False (because a valid syllogism doesn't have to be true)
C: True
D: True

Therefore, the statement that's not true is B. But wait, the question says the correct answer is C. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So if B is false, then B would be the correct answer. But according to the initial thought, the correct answer is C. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, let's re-express the options:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. So it's possible for a valid syllogism to have a false conclusion. That's true because the premises could be false.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. That's false because validity only ensures the structure, not the truth of premises.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. That's true because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

D. The formal validity does not guarantee it's materially true. That's true because validity is about form, not content.

So according to this, B is the false statement, so the answer should be B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue. (True)

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. (False)

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. (True)

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true. (True)

So the statement that is not true is B. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the wording is tricky. Let me think about it differently. If a syllogism is formally valid, it's possible for the conclusion to be true or false depending on the premises. So a valid syllogism can have a true conclusion if the premises are true, and a false conclusion if the premises are false. Therefore, C says that a true conclusion may arise, which is possible, so C is true.

But B says that a valid syllogism must be true, which is not necessarily the case. So B is the false statement.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the conclusion and the syllogism as a whole. A syllogism's material truth would mean all its premises and conclusion are true. So a formally valid syllogism doesn't have to have true premises, so it doesn't have to be materially true as a whole. So B is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, not C.

But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the wording of C is tricky. It says "a materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So even if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be true. So it's possible for the conclusion to be true, regardless of the premises. So C is true because it's possible.

But B is saying that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true, which is false because the syllogism could have false premises making it not true in material fact.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is B, not C. Maybe the initial explanation was incorrect.

The correct answer is B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Syllogisms:** A syllogism is a deductive argument with two premises and a conclusion. Formal validity refers to the logical structure ensuring that true premises lead to a true conclusion, regardless of content.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A:** True. A valid syllogism may have a false conclusion if premises are false.
   - **B:** False. Validity doesn't guarantee material truth; premises might be false.
   - **C:** True. A valid syllogism can lead to a true conclusion if premises are true.
   - **D:** True. Validity doesn't ensure the conclusion is true if premises are false.

3. **Conclusion:** Statement B is not true because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.

**Answer:** B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I'm trying to figure out why the correct answer is C. The question is asking which statement is **not** true. Let's go through each option one by one to understand better.

First, let's recall what a syllogism is. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The validity of a syllogism can be formal or material. Formal validity refers to the structure of the argument, meaning if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Material validity, on the other hand, refers to the actual content and truth of the premises and conclusion.

Now, looking at the options:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.
B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.
C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.
D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

I need to determine which of these is **not** true. Let's analyze each option.

Starting with option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." This seems plausible because formal validity only ensures the structure is correct, not the content. So even if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, but if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be true or false. Wait, no, if a syllogism is formally valid, it means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. It doesn't mean the premises are true. So the syllogism itself, the argument, is valid in form, but the actual truth of the premises could still be false, making the conclusion possibly false as well. So A is saying that such a syllogism may be materially untrue, which is true because the premises could be false.

Moving on to option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Hmm, this seems tricky. If a syllogism is formally valid, it means that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. But for it to be materially true, both the premises and the conclusion must be true. However, formal validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises. So you can have a formally valid syllogism with false premises, leading to a false conclusion, making it not materially true. Therefore, B is saying that if it's formally valid, it must be materially true, which isn't necessarily the case. So B might be the incorrect statement.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." This makes sense because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, then the conclusion must be true. So a formally valid syllogism with true premises will have a true conclusion. Therefore, C is a true statement.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This is true because formal validity is about the structure, not the content. Even if the syllogism is valid, if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be false. So D is a true statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought B was the incorrect statement. Let me double-check. The question is asking which is **not** true. So if B is saying a formally valid syllogism must be materially true, that's not necessarily the case because the premises could be false. So B is the incorrect statement, making it the answer.

But the user said the correct answer is C, which is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.

Option C says a materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism. That's correct because if the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, the conclusion is true. So C is true, not the answer.

So perhaps the user was mistaken, or I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, maybe the question is about which is **not** true, so if all except one are true, then the exception is the answer.

Looking back, A is true, B is false, C is true, D is true. So B is the incorrect statement, making it the answer. But the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps the user is asking why C is the correct answer, but according to my analysis, B is the incorrect one. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is **not** true. So if all except one are true, the exception is the answer. So if B is false, then B is the answer. But the user says the answer is C. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: a syllogism is formally valid if the premises are structured correctly. Material validity depends on the actual truth of the premises and conclusion. So a formally valid syllogism can have false premises, leading to a false conclusion, making it not materially true. So B says it must be true, which is not necessarily the case, so B is false.

But the user says the correct answer is C, which is confusing because C is true. So perhaps the question is different, or maybe a translation issue. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options.

Wait, the options again:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So A is true, B is false, C is true, D is true. Therefore, B is the statement that is not true, making B the answer. But the user says the answer is C. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is which is **not** necessarily true, but phrased differently. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different version of the question.

But according to my analysis, B is the statement that is not true, so the answer should be B. However, since the user says the correct answer is C, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the user is confused, but according to logic, B is incorrect because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth. So the correct answer should be B, not C. Maybe the user made an error.

But given the initial analysis, I think the correct answer is B, unless there's a different interpretation.
</think>

The correct answer to the question "Which of the following statements is **not** true?" is **B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.**

**Explanation:**

- **Option A:** True. A formally valid syllogism can have false premises, making it materially untrue.
- **Option B:** False. Formal validity concerns structure, not truth; thus, a syllogism can be valid without being true.
- **Option C:** True. If a syllogism is valid and premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
- **Option D:** True. Formal validity doesn't ensure the premises are true, so material truth isn't guaranteed.

Thus, the statement that is **not** true is **B**. If the user indicated the answer was C, there might be a misunderstanding, but logically, B is the correct choice.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about syllogisms and their validity. The question is asking which statement is not true. The options are A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out why the correct answer is C, which says, "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." 

First, I should understand what each term means. A syllogism is a form of logical reasoning where a conclusion is drawn from two premises. Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism being logically correct, regardless of the actual truth of the premises. Material truth, on the other hand, refers to the actual content or facts that the syllogism is about.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." That makes sense because even if the structure is correct, if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be false. For example, if both premises are false but the syllogism is structured correctly, it's formally valid but the material truth is false. So A is true.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Hmm, this is tricky. If a syllogism is formally valid, it doesn't necessarily mean the premises are true. The premises could be false, and the conclusion would still be valid in structure, but the content might be untrue. So B is saying that if the form is valid, the material must be true, which isn't necessarily the case. So B might be the incorrect statement, but according to the answer, C is the correct one. I'll need to check the others.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." So this is saying that if the syllogism is structured correctly, it's possible for the conclusion to be true. That makes sense because if the premises are true and the structure is valid, then the conclusion must be true. So C is stating a possibility, which is correct because sometimes the premises are true, sometimes they aren't. So C is true.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This is the converse of option B. Just because the form is valid doesn't mean the content is true. So D is true because formal validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises.

Wait, so going back to option B, it says a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. But as I thought earlier, that's not necessarily the case. A syllogism can be formally valid without its premises being true, so the conclusion might not be true either. Therefore, B is the statement that's not true.

But the user says the correct answer is C. That's conflicting with my initial thought. Maybe I misunderstood the options.

Looking again, option C says "may arise," which is about possibility. So it's saying that it's possible for a formally valid syllogism to have a true conclusion. That is true because if the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion must be true. So C is true.

Wait, maybe I got confused with the negation. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So if C is a true statement, it can't be the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer should be B because it's not necessarily true that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. So B is the statement that's not true.

I think I might have mixed up the options initially. So the answer is B, not C. But the user says the answer is C. Maybe I need to re-examine the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the conclusion is true. Let me think: a syllogism is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true and the syllogism is valid, then the conclusion must be true. So it's possible for a valid syllogism to have a true conclusion, which is what C says. Therefore, C is true.

But B says that a formally valid syllogism must be materially true. That's incorrect because the syllogism's formal validity doesn't depend on the material truth of the premises. So B is the false statement, making it the correct answer to the question "which is not true."

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is C. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the question again. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So if C is true, it can't be the answer. So the answer should be B.

I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The correct answer should be B, not C. But the user insists it's C. Maybe I need to consider that "materially true conclusion" refers only to the conclusion, not the entire syllogism.

Wait, no, the syllogism is about the premises and the conclusion. So a syllogism is valid if the structure is correct, but the conclusion's material truth depends on the premises being true. So a valid syllogism can have a true conclusion if the premises are true, which is possible, making C true. Therefore, the statement that's not true is B, because formal validity doesn't ensure material truth.

I'm getting confused because the user says the answer is C, but based on my reasoning, it should be B. Maybe the question is phrased differently.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So the question is which statement is NOT true. So A is true because a valid syllogism can have false premises, making it untrue. B is saying it must be true, which is false. C is saying a true conclusion may arise, which is true because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. D is true because formal validity doesn't ensure the premises are true.

Therefore, the statement that is not true is B. So why does the user say the answer is C? Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps "materially true conclusion" refers to the conclusion being true, regardless of the premises. But in logic, the conclusion's truth depends on the premises. So a valid syllogism with true premises leads to a true conclusion. So C is true because it's possible, but B is false because it's not necessary.

I think the correct answer should be B, not C. Unless there's a different interpretation. Maybe the user made a mistake in stating the answer. But according to my reasoning, B is the false statement.
</think>

The correct answer is B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true. 

**Explanation:**

- **Option A:** Correct because a valid syllogism can have false premises, making it untrue.
- **Option B:** Incorrect because formal validity doesn't ensure the premises are true, so the conclusion might not be true.
- **Option C:** Correct because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
- **Option D:** Correct because formal validity doesn't guarantee the premises are true.

Thus, the statement that is not true is B.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about syllogisms, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. The options are A, B, C, D, and the question is asking which statement is NOT true. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each option is saying. Let's recall some basics about syllogisms. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of two premises and a conclusion. Formal validity refers to whether the structure of the syllogism is logically sound, meaning if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Material truth, on the other hand, refers to the actual content or factuality of the premises and conclusion.

Option A: "A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue." Hmm, so this is saying that even if the syllogism is structurally correct (formally valid), its content might not be true. That makes sense because the validity is about the form, not the actual truth of the statements. For example, if both premises are false, the conclusion might still be valid in form but untrue in content. So A seems true.

Option B: "A formally valid syllogism must be materially true." Wait, this is saying that if the structure is valid, then the conclusion must be true. But that's not necessarily the case because the truth of the conclusion depends on the truth of the premises. Even if the syllogism is valid, if the premises are false, the conclusion could still be false. So B might be the incorrect statement, which would make it the answer. But let me check the other options.

Option C: "A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism." This means that if a syllogism is valid in form and the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. That sounds correct because a valid syllogism with true premises ensures a true conclusion. So C is true.

Option D: "The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true." This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Just because the structure is valid doesn't mean the premises are true. So D is also true.

Wait, so if B is saying a valid syllogism must be true, but it doesn't have to be because the premises could be false, then B is not necessarily true. Therefore, B is the statement that is not true, making it the correct answer. But the user said the correct answer is C. Did I misunderstand something?

Let me think again. Maybe I misread the options. Option C is saying that a true conclusion may come from a valid syllogism. Well, if the syllogism is valid and the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. So it's possible, but it's not saying it must. So C is a possibility, which is true. So C is a true statement, which means the statement that is not true would be B, which claims it must be true. So why does the user say the correct answer is C?

Wait, perhaps I got confused. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So the user is saying the correct answer is C, but according to my reasoning, B is the incorrect statement. Maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, let's re-express each option:

A: Valid syllogism may be untrue. True, because validity is about form, not content.

B: Valid syllogism must be true. False, because content can be false.

C: True conclusion may arise from valid syllogism. True, because if premises are true, conclusion is true.

D: Validity doesn't guarantee truth. True, because truth depends on premises.

So the statement that's NOT true is B, not C. So why does the user say the correct answer is C?

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A. A formally valid syllogism may be materially untrue.

B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

C. A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.

D. The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.

So the incorrect statement is B, which says valid syllogisms must be true, which is false. Therefore, the answer should be B, not C. But the user says the correct answer is C, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the wording is different. Maybe "may arise" in C is different from "must arise." So C is saying it's possible, which is true because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true. So C is correct.

Therefore, the statement that's not true is B, which claims it must be true. So the correct answer should be B, not C. I must have misunderstood the user's question. Maybe the original question had a different phrasing, but as per the given options, B is the incorrect statement.
</think>

The correct answer is B. A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Syllogisms:**
   - A syllogism's formal validity refers to its structural correctness, ensuring that if the premises are true, the conclusion must follow.
   - Material truth concerns the actual truthfulness of the content.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A:** States a valid syllogism may be untrue. This is true because validity doesn't depend on the content's truth.
   - **B:** Claims a valid syllogism must be true. This is false because the conclusion's truth depends on the premises; they can be false.
   - **C:** Says a true conclusion may arise from a valid syllogism. This is true if the premises are true.
   - **D:** States validity doesn't guarantee truth. This is true as truth hinges on premises.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The incorrect statement is B, as validity doesn't ensure material truth.
