<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Consider the following matrices. 
W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)
Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)
Z = (2/3 1/4; 1/4 1/3)
Note: the format of the above matrices is such that the semicolon separates the rows.

Based on these matrices, choose the correct option. 
Why the correct answer is W, X, and Z are quantum states.?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and matrices. I need to figure out why the correct answer is that W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, let's start by recalling what defines a quantum state in terms of matrices.

I remember that a single-qubit quantum state is represented by a 2x2 density matrix. For a state to be valid, it has to satisfy two main conditions: it must be positive semi-definite (all its eigenvalues should be non-negative) and it must have a trace equal to 1. Also, density matrices are Hermitian, meaning they equal their own conjugate transpose.

First, let me note down the given matrices:

W = (1/2, i/4; -i/4, 1/2)
X = (1/3, 1; 1, 2/3)
Y = (1/2, i/3; -i/3, 1/2)
Z = (2/3, 1/4; 1/4, 1/3)

I need to check each matrix for the three properties: Hermitian, trace equal to 1, and positive semi-definite.

Starting with matrix W:

W = [[1/2, i/4],
     [-i/4, 1/2]]

First, check if it's Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of W would be:

[[1/2, i/4],
 [-i/4, 1/2]]

Which is the same as W. So W is Hermitian.

Next, compute the trace. Trace is the sum of the diagonal elements:

1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So the trace is 1.

Now, check positive semi-definite. For that, I need to compute the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] are given by (a + d)/2 ± sqrt[(a - d)^2/4 + bc].

So for W:

a = 1/2, d = 1/2, b = i/4, c = -i/4.

Compute (a + d)/2: (1/2 + 1/2)/2 = 1/2.

Compute sqrt[( (1/2 - 1/2)^2 )/4 + (i/4)(-i/4)].

First, (1/2 - 1/2)^2 = 0, so that term is 0.

Next, (i/4)(-i/4) = (-i^2)/16 = -(-1)/16 = 1/16.

So sqrt[0 + 1/16] = 1/4.

Therefore, eigenvalues are 1/2 ± 1/4, which gives 3/4 and 1/4. Both are non-negative. So W is positive semi-definite.

So W satisfies all three conditions. Therefore, W is a quantum state.

Moving on to matrix X:

X = [[1/3, 1],
     [1, 2/3]]

Check if it's Hermitian. The conjugate transpose would be [[1/3, 1], [1, 2/3]], which is the same as X. So X is Hermitian.

Trace: 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Good.

Now eigenvalues. Same formula:

a = 1/3, d = 2/3, b = 1, c = 1.

Compute (a + d)/2: (1/3 + 2/3)/2 = (1)/2 = 1/2.

Compute sqrt[( (1/3 - 2/3)^2 )/4 + (1)(1)].

First, (1/3 - 2/3)^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9. Divided by 4: 1/36.

Then, (1)(1) = 1.

So sqrt[1/36 + 1] = sqrt[37/36] = sqrt(37)/6 ≈ 1.086.

Thus, eigenvalues are 1/2 ± sqrt(37)/6.

Compute sqrt(37): approximately 6.082, so sqrt(37)/6 ≈ 1.0137.

Thus, 1/2 + 1.0137 ≈ 1.5137 and 1/2 - 1.0137 ≈ -0.5137.

Wait a second, one eigenvalue is negative. That means X is not positive semi-definite. So X cannot be a quantum state. But the statement says W, X, and Z are quantum states. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvalues calculation. Maybe I messed up the formula.

Eigenvalues are (a + d)/2 ± sqrt[(a - d)^2/4 + bc].

So a = 1/3, d = 2/3.

Compute (a - d)^2: (1/3 - 2/3)^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Divide by 4: 1/36.

Compute bc: (1)(1) = 1.

Thus, sqrt(1/36 + 1) = sqrt(37/36) = sqrt(37)/6 ≈ 1.0137.

So then eigenvalues:

(1/3 + 2/3)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5.

Thus, 0.5 ± 1.0137.

So, 0.5 + 1.0137 ≈ 1.5137 and 0.5 - 1.0137 ≈ -0.5137. So yes, one negative eigenvalue.

Here, let me double-check the eigenvalues calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the matrices.

Eigenvalues are (a + d)/2 ± sqrt[(a - d)^2/4 + bc].

So a = 1/3, d = 2/3.

Compute (a - d)^2: (1/3 - 2/3)^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Divide by 4: 1/36.

Compute bc: (1)(1) = 1.

Now, sqrt(1/36 + 1) = sqrt(37/36) = sqrt(37)/6 ≈ 1.0137.

So then eigenvalues:

(1/3 + 2/3)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5.

Oh, 0.5 ± 1.0137.

So, 0.5 + 1.0137 ≈ 1.5137 and 0.5 - 1.0137 ≈ -0.5137. So yes, one negative eigenvalue.

Ah, let me double-check the eigenvalues calculation. maybe I need to consider that X is a valid state in a different way.

Eigenvalues are (a + d)/2 ± sqrt[(a - d)^2/4 + bc].

So a = 1/3, d = 2/3.

Compute (a - d)^2: (1/3 - 2/3)^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9.

Divide by 4: 1/36.

Compute bc: (1)(1) = 1.

Actually, sqrt(1/36 + 1) = sqrt(37/36) = sqrt(37)/6 ≈ 1.0137.

So then eigenvalues:

(1/3 + 2/3)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5.

Next, 0.5 ± 1.0137.

So, 0.5 + 1.0137 ≈ 1.5137 and 0.5 - 1.0137 ≈ -0.5137. So yes, one negative eigenvalue.
