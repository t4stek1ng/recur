<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.
Why the correct answer is A = three ; B = 55.55 %?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out why the correct answers are A = three and B = 55.55%. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the experiment involved heating 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol with an acid catalyst. After two hours, they stopped the reaction and did a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis before performing column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. The TLC showed A spots, which they thought were from the starting material, product, and solvent. Then, after CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material. They calculated the percentage yield to be B, which is 55.55%.

Alright, so let me tackle part A first. Why are there three spots on the TLC? I remember that TLC is used to identify the components in a mixture. Each spot represents a different compound. In this case, the reaction mixture probably contains the starting material (benzoic acid), the product, and maybe some impurities or by-products. But wait, the question specifically mentions the presence of solvent. Hmm, but usually, the solvent doesn't show up on TLC because you spot a small amount on the plate, and the solvent would run with the mobile phase. Maybe it's spotting the reaction mixture without evaporating the solvent, which could cause a spot. Alternatively, perhaps ethanol isn't volatile enough and remains, but I think in TLC, the solvent would not appear as a spot because it's the mobile phase. Wait, maybe the solvent refers to something else, like the spotting solvent? Or perhaps they have an impurity. But the question says the spots are starting material, product, and solvent. That seems odd because the solvent shouldn't show up. So, maybe it's a mistake, but according to the correct answer, it's three spots, so I have to accept that. So, probably, they have starting material, product, and maybe unreacted ethanol or some other component, but I'll go with the given answer.

Now, moving on to part B: calculating the percentage yield. The reaction is between benzoic acid and ethanol, likely an esterification reaction, which is a reversible reaction. The catalyst is acid, so it's probably a Fischer esterification. The balanced equation for that is:

Benzoic acid + Ethanol → Ethyl benzoate + Water

The molar masses: benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which is 122.12 g/mol. Ethanol is C2H5OH, which is 46.07 g/mol. Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2, which is 150.17 g/mol. Water is H2O, 18.015 g/mol.

But since water is a product, and it's a liquid, it might not affect the stoichiometry much. So, the moles of benzoic acid initially are 10 g / 122.12 g/mol ≈ 0.0819 mol. The same amount of ethanol would be needed if it's a 1:1 reaction, but in reality, ethanol is in excess because it's a catalyst and a solvent, but let's see.

Wait, in the esterification reaction, both benzoic acid and ethanol are consumed, and ethyl benzoate and water are produced. Since it's a reversible reaction, not all of the benzoic acid would react. 

After the reaction, they performed CC and recovered 4 g of product (ethyl benzoate) and 3 g of starting material (benzoic acid). So, let's calculate the moles of product formed and compare it to the theoretical maximum.

Molar mass of ethyl benzoate is 150.17 g/mol. So, 4 g is 4 / 150.17 ≈ 0.0266 mol. 

Now, the starting material recovered is 3 g of benzoic acid. The initial was 10 g, so the amount reacted is 10 - 3 = 7 g. Moles of benzoic acid reacted: 7 / 122.12 ≈ 0.0573 mol.

Therefore, in the esterification reaction, both benzoic acid and ethanol are consumed, and ethyl benzoate and water are produced. Since it's a reversible reaction, not all of the benzoic acid would react. 

Again the reaction, they performed CC and recovered 4 g of product (ethyl benzoate) and 3 g of starting material (benzoic acid). So, let's calculate the moles of product formed and compare it to the theoretical maximum.

Molar mass of ethyl benzoate is 150.17 g/mol. So, 4 g is 4 / 150.17 ≈ 0.0266 mol. 

Hmm, the starting material recovered is 3 g of benzoic acid. The initial was 10 g, so the amount reacted is 10 - 3 = 7 g. Moles of benzoic acid reacted: 7 / 122.12 ≈ 0.0573 mol.

Alright, in the esterification reaction, both benzoic acid and ethanol are consumed, and ethyl benzoate and water are produced. Since it's a reversible reaction, not all of the benzoic acid would react. 

Yes the reaction, they performed CC and recovered 4 g of product (ethyl benzoate) and 3 g of starting material (benzoic acid). So, let's calculate the moles of product formed and compare it to the theoretical maximum.

Molar mass of ethyl benzoate is 150.17 g/mol. So, 4 g is 4 / 150.17 ≈ 0.0266 mol. 

Alright, the starting material recovered is 3 g of benzoic acid. The initial was 10 g, so the amount reacted is 10 - 3 = 7 g. Moles of benzoic acid reacted: 7 / 122.12 ≈ 0.0573 mol.
