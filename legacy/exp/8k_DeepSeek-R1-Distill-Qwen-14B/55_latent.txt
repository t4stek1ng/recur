Alright, so I've come across this physics problem, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is B. 2mc². Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a photon striking an electron that's initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. Then, the photon is destroyed, and the positron along with the two electrons move off at equal speeds in the same direction as the photon. We need to find the energy of the photon.

First, I remember that when a photon interacts with matter, conservation laws must be applied—specifically conservation of energy and momentum. Since the system starts with the electron at rest, its initial momentum is zero. After the collision, we have three particles: two electrons and a positron, all moving with equal speeds in the same direction as the photon. 

Let me note down the given data:

- Mass of the electron (and positron, since they are the same mass): m
- Initial electron is at rest, so initial momentum is zero
- Photon's energy is what we need to find

Let me denote:

- Energy of the photon as E_photon
- Since the photon is destroyed, its energy contributes to the kinetic energy of the resulting particles
- The three particles (two electrons and a positron) move off with equal speeds, say v

Since all three move at the same speed, their momenta will be equal in magnitude. Let me think about the momentum conservation here.

Initially, the system (electron + photon) has momentum only from the photon because the electron is at rest. The photon's momentum is E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc, so p = E/c.

After the collision, the total momentum should equal the initial momentum, so the sum of the momenta of the three particles should be equal to the photon's momentum.

But since all three have the same speed, their momenta will be m*v for each, assuming non-relativistic speeds. Wait, but since the speed might be significant (because the photon's energy is on the order of mc², which is rest energy), maybe relativistic effects are important here. Hmm, but let me first try with non-relativistic and see where that goes.

Wait, but the problem is about energy and momentum, so it's better to use exact relativistic equations. Because when dealing with particles moving at speeds comparable to c, relativistic effects are important.

So, for each particle, their relativistic momentum is gamma * m * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Since all three have the same speed, their momenta will each be gamma*m*v. So total momentum after collision is 3 * gamma * m * v.

Similarly, but the problem is about energy and momentum, so it's better to use exact relativistic equations. Because when dealing with particles moving at speeds comparable to c, relativistic effects are important.

So, for each particle, their relativistic momentum is gamma * m * v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Since all three have the same speed, their momenta will each be gamma*m*v. So total momentum after collision is 3 * gamma * m * v.
