<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).
Why the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism. I need to figure out why the correct answers are A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about two parts: A and B. Part A is asking which compound does NOT show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me start with part A. I need to understand what tautomerism is. From what I remember, tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton and a neighboring atom's bond shifts, resulting in the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds. This causes a change in the structure of the molecule without changing the molecular formula. An example is between keto and enol forms.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone. These are structural isomers, but can they tautomerize? Wait, actually, benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. I'm not sure if it can tautomerize. Maybe it can form some enol form, but since both are ketones, would that lead to a different structure? Or perhaps it's more about whether the structure allows for keto-enol tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. So it's a six-membered ring with three ketones, each separated by a single carbon. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent proton and double bond. In this case, the ketones are all on different carbons, but maybe there's a possibility of enol formation. However, with three ketone groups, I'm not sure if it can form an enol because each ketone is separated by a single CH2 group. Wait, no, the ring would have three carbonyl groups, each on a carbon that's adjacent to another ketone? No, 1,3,5 are alternate positions on the ring, so each is separated by one carbon. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2.

Wait, but that might not actually be right. Let me think: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups on every alternate carbon, which means each is separated by one CH2 group. So, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to two other carbons, each of which is also a ketone? No, because 1,3,5 are not adjacent. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2 connected in a ring. So each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. Hmm. 

So, can this structure undergo keto-enol tautomerism? For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2, so the adjacent carbons have hydrogens. So, perhaps each of those CH2 groups could lose a hydrogen and form an enol. But wait, if each ketone is separated by a CH2, can an enol form? Let's imagine: if a hydrogen from the CH2 next to a ketone is removed, forming a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. But each of those carbons is a ketone, so the double bond would be between two carbonyls? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have O=C-CH2-CO, removing a hydrogen from the middle CH2 would give O=C-CH2-CO becoming O=C-CH(-O)-CO? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Tautomerism generally involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond. For example, in a diketone, you can have keto and enol forms. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a symmetrical molecule with three ketone groups, maybe the possibility for tautomerism is limited because each ketone is not adjacent to another, but separated. So, perhaps it cannot tautomerize because you can't form an enol without having adjacent carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe tautomerism is possible, but in a different way.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. Benzene rings with two ketones can form enol tautomers if the structure allows for conjugation. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are opposite each other. Can this undergo keto-enol tautomerism? I think in some cases, quinones can have enol forms, but I'm not sure if benzoquinone specifically can. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the conjugation is already extensive, so the enol form isn't as favorable.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring, allowing for some resonance structures. Whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketones, might not have the necessary adjacent hydrogens to form an enol.

Similarly, I might be getting confused. Tautomerism generally involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond. For example, in a diketone, you can have keto and enol forms. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a symmetrical molecule with three ketone groups, maybe the possibility for tautomerism is limited because each ketone is not adjacent to another, but separated. So, perhaps it cannot tautomerize because you can't form an enol without having adjacent carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe tautomerism is possible, but in a different way.

Alright, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups are conjugated through the ring, allowing for some resonance structures. Whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketones, might not have the necessary adjacent hydrogens to form an enol.
