[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state is given as ψ = (1/√3)(|↑1↑2↓3 + |↑1↓2↑3 + |↓1↑2↑3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value. The answer is given as not an eigenstate with expectation value (2/3)Aħ², but I need to understand why.

First, I should recall that for spin systems, the dot product of two spin operators can be expressed using the total spin operator. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i+j}² - S_i² - S_j²). Since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i² = (3/4)ħ² for each i. Also, the total spin S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I can find the value of S² for the state ψ, maybe I can relate it to the expectation value of H.

But wait, H is a sum of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. Let me write that:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

From the total spin formula:

S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, rearranging:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2

Therefore, the expectation value of H would be:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩)/2

I know that each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so the sum ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩ is 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². So, substituting back:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - (9/4)ħ²)/2

So, if I can compute ⟨S²⟩ for the state ψ, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

Now, what is S² for ψ? S² is the square of the total spin operator. The possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. I think ψ is a symmetric state under exchange of particles, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of S².

But let me think about the state ψ. It's a symmetric combination where exactly two spins are up and one is down. Each term has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, the total spin projection is 1/2.

But what is the total spin S? For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The state ψ must belong to one of these multiplets. Let me think about it.

The state ψ is a symmetric state with two up spins and one down spin. So, how does it transform under the exchange of particles? Since swapping any two particles leaves the state invariant (because it just changes the position of up and down, but the overall structure remains the same), it's symmetric.

In terms of total spin, the completely symmetric states with S=3/2 have S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2, while the states with S=1/2 are more complicated. But ψ has S_z = 1/2. So, does ψ belong to S=3/2 or S=1/2?

Wait, actually, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for whether ψ is an eigenstate of S².

Alternatively, another approach: compute S² acting on ψ and see if it's proportional to ψ.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that ψ is a singlet state or something similar. But no, since it's a combination of two up and one down spins.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S² by using S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Expanding that, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But that's the same as above, so maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of ψ as a combination of states in the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplets.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the expectation value ⟨S²⟩ directly.

Wait, no, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j and then sum them up.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, E = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩)

So, I need to compute each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩.

Since all the terms are symmetric, I can compute one of them and multiply by 3.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

But S1·S2 = (1/4)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ )

But for each particle, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ², so ⟨S1^2⟩ = ⟨S2^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² )

So, that's (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - (3/2) ħ² )

Now, what is ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩? That's the expectation value of the square of the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

In the state ψ, each term is a product of three spins, two up and one down. Let's see: for each term in ψ, when considering particles 1 and 2, they can be both up, or one up and one down.

Wait, in the state ψ, which is (|↑↑↓ + |↑↓↑ + |↓↑↑)/√3, each term has exactly two up spins and one down.

So, let's look at particles 1 and 2 in each term:

1. |↑↑↓: particles 1 and 2 are both up.

2. |↑↓↑: particles 1 and 2 are up and down.

3. |↓↑↑: particles 1 and 2 are down and up.

Therefore, the possible states for particles 1 and 2 are:

- Both up (first term),

- Up and down (second term),

- Down and up (third term).

So, the state ψ is a symmetric combination over all three particles, but for any two particles, it's a combination where sometimes they're both up, sometimes one up and one down.

Therefore, when considering the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2, we need to compute the average of (S1 + S2)^2 over these states.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the possible values.

In the state ψ, the possible combinations for particles 1 and 2 are:

- ↑↑,

- ↑↓,

- ↓↑.

Each of these occurs in one term of the state ψ.

So, the state can be written as (|↑↑↓ + |↑↓↑ + |↓↑↑)/√3.

If we look at particles 1 and 2, the state is:

(|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3 ⊗ |↓↑⟩ or something? Wait, no, in each term, the third particle is the one that's down or up.

Wait, actually, to get the state for particles 1 and 2, we can think of the state as:

( |↑↑⟩_12 |↓⟩_3 + |↑↓⟩_12 |↑⟩_3 + |↓↑⟩_12 |↑⟩_3 ) /√3.

So, for particles 1 and 2, the state is (|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3, but each combined with the appropriate state of particle 3.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ for the state ψ.

Alternatively, note that S1 + S2 can have eigenvalues corresponding to total spin S=1 or S=0, since two spin-1/2 particles can combine to S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet).

In our case, the state for particles 1 and 2 is (|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3. Let's find out what this state is in terms of total spin.

First, normalize the state: it's (|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3.

Compute the norm: each term is orthogonal, so the norm is (1 + 1 + 1)/3 = 1, so it's already normalized.

Now, express this state in terms of the triplet and singlet states.

The triplet states (S=1) are:

- |1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩,

- |1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2,

- |1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

The singlet state (S=0) is |0,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.

So, let's write our state as:

(|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3

= |1,1⟩ + [ |1,0⟩ * √2 + |0,0⟩ * √2 ] / √3

Wait, let me double-check:

We have |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩.

So, our state is |↑↑⟩ + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 * √2 / √3.

Wait, no:

Wait, let me write:

Our state is |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩.

Expressed in triplet and singlet:

= |1,1⟩ + (|1,0⟩ + |0,0⟩ * √2 ) / √2

Wait, actually:

|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩ + √2 |0,0⟩?

Wait, no. Wait, the singlet is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, and the triplet m=0 is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

So, let's write |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩.

Therefore, our state becomes:

|↑↑⟩ + √2 |1,0⟩.

But wait, |↑↑⟩ is |1,1⟩, and |1,0⟩ is part of the triplet. So, our state is |1,1⟩ + √2 |1,0⟩. Hmm, but that would have different coefficients.

But wait, our original state is (|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3.

Let me write it as:

( |↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ) /√3

= |↑↑⟩/√3 + (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3

= |↑↑⟩/√3 + (√2 |1,0⟩)/√3

So, the state is a combination of |1,1⟩ and |1,0⟩.

Therefore, it's not an eigenstate of S1 + S2, but we can compute the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2.

Since (S1 + S2)^2 |S,M⟩ = ħ² S(S+1) |S,M⟩.

But since our state is a combination of |1,1⟩ and |1,0⟩, let's compute the expectation value.

The state is:

ψ_12 = |1,1⟩/√3 + |1,0⟩/√(3/2) ?

Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, |↑↑⟩ = |1,1⟩,

and |1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

So, our state ψ_12 is:

|1,1⟩/√3 + (|1,0⟩)/√(3/2).

Wait, because |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩, so (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3 = (√2 |1,0⟩)/√3.

Therefore, ψ_12 = |1,1⟩/√3 + √2 |1,0⟩/√3.

So, it's ( |1,1⟩ + √2 |1,0⟩ ) /√3.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1 + S2 squared is:

⟨ψ_12| (S1 + S2)^2 |ψ_12⟩

= (1/3) [ ⟨1,1| + √2 ⟨1,0| ] [ (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩ + √2 (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ ].

But (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩ = ħ² * 1*(1+1) |1,1⟩ = 2ħ² |1,1⟩.

Similarly, (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ = 2ħ² |1,0⟩.

So,

= (1/3) [ ⟨1,1| + √2 ⟨1,0| ] [ 2ħ² |1,1⟩ + 2ħ² √2 |1,0⟩ ]

= (1/3) [ 2ħ² ⟨1,1|1,1⟩ + 2ħ² √2 ⟨1,1|1,0⟩ + 2ħ² √2 ⟨1,0|1,1⟩ + 2ħ² * 2 ⟨1,0|1,0⟩ ]

But ⟨1,1|1,0⟩ = 0 and ⟨1,0|1,1⟩ = 0.

So, we have:

= (1/3) [ 2ħ² *1 + 0 + 0 + 2ħ² * 2 *1 ]

= (1/3)(2ħ² + 4ħ²) = (1/3)(6ħ²) = 2ħ².

Therefore, ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = 2ħ².

So, going back to ⟨S1·S2⟩:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 3/2 ħ² )

= (1/4)(2ħ² - (3/2)ħ² ) = (1/4)( (4/2 - 3/2) ħ² ) = (1/4)( (1/2) ħ² ) = (1/8) ħ².

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought that for two spins, ⟨S·S⟩ is (1/4)(⟨S²⟩ - 3/4 ħ²). Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, S_i·S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² )

So, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S_i + S_j)^2⟩ - ⟨S_i²⟩ - ⟨S_j²⟩ )

But S_i² = 3/4 ħ², so:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² )

Wait, but earlier I computed ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = 2ħ². So:

= (1/4)(2ħ² - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² )

= (1/4)(2ħ² - (3/2)ħ² )

= (1/4)( (4/2 - 3/2)ħ² )

= (1/4)(1/2 ħ² ) = (1/8) ħ².

Hmm, so each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ is (1/8) ħ².

But since there are three such terms in H, the total expectation value would be 3*(1/8) ħ² * A = (3/8) A ħ².

But wait, that contradicts the given answer of (2/3) A ħ². So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's check my calculation again.

First, computing ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩.

I found it to be 2ħ². But let me double-check.

The state for particles 1 and 2 is ψ_12 = (|↑↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√3.

Expressed in terms of total spin, it's |1,1⟩/√3 + |1,0⟩/√(3/2).

Wait, actually, |1,0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2. So, the coefficient for |1,0⟩ is 1/√3 multiplied by √2, so (√2)/√3.

Therefore, the state is:

ψ_12 = |1,1⟩/√3 + |1,0⟩*(√2)/√3

Therefore, the squared norm is (1/3) + (2/3) = 1, which is correct.

Now, the expectation value of (S1 + S2)^2 is:

⟨ψ_12| (S1 + S2)^2 |ψ_12⟩

= (1/3)⟨1,1| + (√2/√3)⟨1,0| ) ( (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩ + (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ (√2/√3) )

But (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩ = 2ħ² |1,1⟩

Similarly, (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ = 2ħ² |1,0⟩

So,

= (1/3) [ ⟨1,1| 2ħ² |1,1⟩ + √2 ⟨1,0| 2ħ² |1,0⟩ ] + (√2/√3) [ ⟨1,1| 2ħ² |1,0⟩ + ⟨1,0| 2ħ² |1,1⟩ ] + (√2/√3)(√2/√3) [ ⟨1,0| 2ħ² |1,0⟩ ]

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe a better way is to note that the state is a linear combination of |1,1⟩ and |1,0⟩, so the expectation value is:

= |c1|^2 ⟨1,1| (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩ + |c0|^2 ⟨1,0| (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ + c1 c0* ⟨1,1| (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ + c0 c1* ⟨1,0| (S1 + S2)^2 |1,1⟩

But since (S1 + S2)^2 |1,0⟩ is 2ħ² |1,0⟩ and similarly for |1,1⟩, the cross terms will vanish because ⟨1,1|1,0⟩ = 0.

Therefore, the expectation value is:

|c1|^2 * 2ħ² + |c0|^2 * 2ħ²

Where c1 = 1/√3 and c0 = √2/√3.

So,

= (1/3) * 2ħ² + (2/3) * 2ħ²

= (2ħ²/3) + (4ħ²/3) = 6ħ²/3 = 2ħ².

So, that confirms that ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = 2ħ².

Thus, going back, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(2ħ² - 3/2 ħ² ) = (1/4)( (4/2 - 3/2)ħ² ) = (1/4)(1/2 ħ² ) = (1/8) ħ².

But if each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = 1/8 ħ², then the sum is 3*(1/8) ħ² = 3/8 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A * 3/8 ħ² = (3/8) A ħ².

But the given answer is (2/3) A ħ², so something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j directly, instead of using the total spin.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨S_i·S_j⟩.

Wait, let's compute ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ directly using the state ψ.

Given that ψ is symmetric under exchange of particles, the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 are all the same. So, it's sufficient to compute one and multiply by three.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z )

But it's easier to use the fact that S_i·S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 )

But perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, since the state ψ is a symmetric combination of two up spins and one down, maybe we can find the expectation value of S_i·S_j in such a state.

But let me think about S1·S2.

In the state ψ, each term has two up spins and one down. So, for each term, let's compute S1·S2.

But wait, in the state ψ, which is a superposition of three terms:

1. |↑↑↓⟩,

2. |↑↓↑⟩,

3. |↓↑↑⟩.

Each term has S1 and S2 either both up, or one up and one down.

So, let's compute S1·S2 for each term.

First, for |↑↑↓⟩:

S1·S2 = ( (1/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| + (1/2)|↓⟩⟨↓| ) ⊗ ( (1/2)|↑⟩⟨↑| + (1/2)|↓⟩⟨↓| )

But actually, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z )

But since S_i^x and S_i^y have matrix elements that are off-diagonal, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using eigenvalues.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 4.

But for each term, let's compute S_i·S_j.

But wait, in each term of ψ, S_i and S_j have definite z-components.

For example, in |↑↑↓⟩, S1 and S2 are both up, so their z-components are ħ/2 each.

So, S_z1 = ħ/2, S_z2 = ħ/2.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1 is up, S2 is down, so S_z1 = ħ/2, S_z2 = -ħ/2.

Same for |↓↑↑⟩.

But for S_i·S_j, besides the z-component, there are x and y components.

But maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value by considering that in each basis state, S_i·S_j has definite value in the z-basis, but off-diagonal terms may contribute when taking the expectation over the superposition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a product state |s1 s2 s3⟩, S_i·S_j can be computed as (3/4 ħ² δ_ij - (1/4)ħ² )? Wait, no.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i+j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 )

So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)( S_{i+j}^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² ) )

But S_{i+j}^2 can be either ( (1)(1+1)ħ² ) = 2ħ² (for triplet) or 0 (for singlet).

Therefore, for each product state, S_i·S_j is either (1/2)(2ħ² - 3/2 ħ² ) = (1/2)( (4/2 - 3/2) ħ² ) = (1/2)(1/2 ħ² ) = (1/4) ħ² (triplet), or (1/2)(0 - 3/2 ħ² ) = -3/4 ħ² (singlet).

So, for each term in ψ, which is a product state, we can compute S_i·S_j.

In |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, so they form a triplet state, so S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 and 2 are up and down, which is a singlet state, so S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ².

Same for |↓↑↑⟩: particles 1 and 2 are down and up, which is also a singlet state, so S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ is:

(1/3)[ (1/4 ħ² ) + (-3/4 ħ² ) + (-3/4 ħ² ) ]

= (1/3)[ (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ² ]

= (1/3)[ (-5/4) ħ² ] = (-5/12) ħ²

Hmm, that's different from what I got earlier. Which one is correct?

Wait, this approach directly evaluates S1·S2 for each term in the state ψ and averages them. Since ψ is an equal superposition, each term contributes equally.

So, according to this, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (-5/12) ħ².

But earlier, using the total spin approach, I got ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/8) ħ², which is positive. That seems contradictory.

So, which method is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach because when I computed ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩, I didn't account for the fact that the state is a superposition where sometimes the spins are up and sometimes are down.

Wait, but in the first approach, I found ⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ = 2ħ², which corresponds to an average of S=1, but in reality, the state is a combination of S=1 and S=0.

Wait, but when I computed S1·S2 for each term, I got different results, which suggests that the overall expectation value is a combination of +1/4 and -3/4.

So, let me do that computation again.

The state ψ is (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/√3.

So, when computing ⟨S1·S2⟩, it's the average over these three terms.

Each term is orthogonal, so when taking the expectation value, it's the sum of each term's contribution divided by 3.

So, for each term:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ².

2. |↑↓↑⟩: S1·S2 = (-3/4) ħ².

3. |↓↑↑⟩: S1·S2 = (-3/4) ħ².

So, the average is:

( (1/4) + (-3/4) + (-3/4) ) / 3 * ħ²

= (1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 3 * ħ²

= (1/4 - 6/4 ) / 3 * ħ²

= (-5/4) / 3 * ħ²

= (-5/12) ħ².

So, that's the correct ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Similarly, since ψ is symmetric, ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩ are the same.

Therefore, each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (-5/12) ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = A*( (-5/12) + (-5/12) + (-5/12) ) ħ²

= A*( -15/12 ) ħ²

= A*( -5/4 ) ħ².

But wait, that's negative, but the given answer is positive (2/3)Aħ².

Clearly, something is wrong. Because in the state ψ, which has two up spins and one down, the expectation value of S_i·S_j seems negative, but the given answer is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, S_i·S_j for two spins in a triplet state (S=1) is (1/4) ħ², and for a singlet state (S=0) is (-3/4) ħ².

But in our state ψ, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), sometimes the pair is in a triplet, sometimes in a singlet.

Wait, no. For particles 1 and 2, in the three terms:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: triplet,

2. |↑↓↑⟩: singlet,

3. |↓↑↑⟩: singlet.

Similarly, for particles 1 and 3:

In |↑↑↓⟩: particles 1 and 3 are up and down, which is singlet,

In |↑↓↑⟩: particles 1 and 3 are up and up, which is triplet,

In |↓↑↑⟩: particles 1 and 3 are down and up, which is singlet.

Similarly for particles 2 and 3.

Therefore, for each pair, in one term they are triplet, and in the other two terms, they are singlet.

Therefore, for each pair, the expectation value is (1*(1/4) + 2*(-3/4))/3 = (1/4 - 3/2)/3 = (-5/4)/3 = -5/12 ħ².

Therefore, each ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = -5/12 ħ², as before.

Therefore, the total ⟨H⟩ = 3*(-5/12) * A ħ² = -15/12 A ħ² = -5/4 A ħ².

But this contradicts the given answer of 2/3 A ħ².

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should compute the expectation value of H directly by calculating ⟨ψ| H |ψ⟩.

So, H = A(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, ⟨H⟩ = A [ ⟨ψ|S1·S2|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S1·S3|ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|S2·S3|ψ⟩ ]

Since ψ is symmetric, each term will be the same, so it's 3*A*⟨S1·S2⟩.

So, I need to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ correctly.

Alternatively, let's write S_i·S_j in terms of ladder operators.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value by expanding H.

But perhaps we can use the fact that the state ψ is an eigenstate of some operator.

Wait, actually, let's think about the total spin S².

As I initially thought, S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - (S1² + S2² + S3² )) / 2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = A*(S² - (S1² + S2² + S3² )) / 2.

Thus, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩ ) / 2.

We know that each S_i² = 3/4 ħ², so ⟨S1² + S2² + S3²⟩ = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S²⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

So, if we can compute ⟨S²⟩, we can find ⟨H⟩.

So, what is ⟨S²⟩ for the state ψ?

S² is the square of the total spin. For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

The state ψ is a symmetric state with S_z = 1/2 (each term has two up and one down, so total S_z is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2).

Now, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The symmetric states with S=3/2 have S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. The state ψ has S_z = 1/2, so it could be part of the S=3/2 multiplet or the S=1/2 multiplet.

However, the dimension of the S=3/2 representation is 4 (from S_z = 
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It involves a system of three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3) times the sum of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if not, what the expectation value of energy is.

Alright, first step, I need to understand what the Hamiltonian represents. The Hamiltonian is a sum of the dot products of the spin operators for each pair of particles. Since each Si is a spin-1/2 particle, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin operators. I remember that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i}^{+}S_{j}^{-} + S_{i}^{-}S_{j}^{+}) ) + S_{i}^{z}S_{j}^{z}. But I also recall that S_i·S_j can be written in terms of the total spin squared, S_total^2. Specifically, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). 

So, if I rearrange that, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed as (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ² for spin-1/2 particles, substituting that in would give us:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - 3*(3/4 ħ² )) / 2 ) = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4 ħ² )) / 2.

Hmm, that simplifies H in terms of the total spin squared. That might be helpful because if I can determine the total spin quantum number for the state psi, I can compute the expectation value of H more easily.

Looking at the given state psi: 1/sqrt(3) [up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3]. Let me analyze this state. Each term has two spin-up particles and one spin-down particle. So, it's a symmetric combination of the three possible states where exactly two spins are up and one is down. 

I need to figure out the total spin of this state. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can range from S=3/2 down to S=1/2, in integer steps. However, constructing the states for these total spins is a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

But wait, let's think about symmetries. The state psi is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. Because swapping any two particles just swaps the terms, and since all terms are similar, the state remains the same. So, the state is symmetric under permutation of particles. Now, in terms of spin states, symmetric states under permutation often correspond to higher total spin states.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the fully symmetric states form the S=3/2 multiplet. The antisymmetric states would form the S=1/2 multiplets. Since our state is symmetric, it must belong to the S=3/2 multiplet. Therefore, S_total^2 should have eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 +1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

Wait, hold on, let me verify that. The eigenvalues of S_total^2 are S(S+1)ħ². If the state is in the S=3/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 psi = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² psi = (15/4) ħ² psi.

Therefore, plugging that into H:

H = A*( (15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( (6/4 ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( (3/2 ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*( 3/4 ħ² ) = (3A/4)ħ².

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match the answer given in the problem statement, which is 2/3 A ħ². Did I do something wrong here?

Alternatively, maybe my assumption that psi is in the S=3/2 multiplet is incorrect. Let me think again. The state psi is a combination of two-up and one-down spins. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states with two up and one down could be in either the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplets. So perhaps I need to compute S_total^2 explicitly to find out.

Let me recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding this gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, as before, we have S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )) / 2.

But we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 in the state psi as follows:

E = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩ ) = A*( 3⟨S1·S2⟩ ), since all terms are symmetric.

So, maybe instead of going through S_total^2, I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ directly.

But S1·S2 can be written as (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). So, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectations of each component.

So, let me compute ⟨psi | S1^x S2^x | psi⟩, ⟨psi | S1^y S2^y | psi⟩, and ⟨psi | S1^z S2^z | psi⟩, then sum them up.

Given that, perhaps it's easier to compute for each pair, say S1·S2, in the state psi.

But wait, the state psi is symmetric in all three particles, so the expectation values for S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 will all be the same. Therefore, E = A*(3⟨S1·S2⟩), so I just need to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ once and multiply by 3.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩. But how?

Each S_i^z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for up and -ħ/2 for down. Similarly, S_i^x and S_i^y can be expressed in terms of raising and lowering operators: S_i^x = (S_i^+ + S_i^-)/2, S_i^y = (S_i^+ - S_i^-)/(2i).

So, perhaps I can compute the expectation values:

First, compute ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩: since S1^z and S2^z act on different particles, I can compute this as the product of their individual expectations.

Looking at the state psi, each term in psi is a product state where each particle is either up or down. So, in each term, S1^z is either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2, S2^z is likewise, and S3^z is either up or down.

But since we're looking at S1^z S2^z, the contribution from each term in psi will be (S1^z)(S2^z). Let's compute this for each term:

1. up1 up2 down3: S1^z = ħ/2, S2^z = ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z = (ħ/2)^2
2. up1 down2 up3: S1^z = ħ/2, S2^z = -ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z = -(ħ/2)^2
3. down1 up2 up3: S1^z = -ħ/2, S2^z = ħ/2, so S1^z S2^z = -(ħ/2)^2

So, the expectation value ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ is [ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ] divided by 3, since each term is equally weighted (because psi is normalized with 1/sqrt(3)).

So, that's [ (1 -1 -1)/4 ] ħ² / 3 = (-1/4) ħ² / 3 = -ħ²/(12). So, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = -ħ²/12.

Next, I need to compute ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ and ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩.

Hmm, this seems trickier because S1^x and S2^x involve raising and lowering operators. Let's recall that S_i^+ | up ⟩ = 0, S_i^- | up ⟩ = ħ | down ⟩, and S_i^+ | down ⟩ = ħ | up ⟩, S_i^- | down ⟩ = 0.

Expressed in terms of these, S1^x = (S1^+ + S1^-)/2 and similarly for S2^x. So, S1^x S2^x = (S1^+ + S1^-)(S2^+ + S2^-)/4.

Expanding this gives four terms: S1^+ S2^+, S1^+ S2^-, S1^- S2^+, and S1^- S2^-.

Similarly for S1^y S2^y, using S1^y = (S1^+ - S1^-)/(2i), so S1^y S2^y = (S1^+ - S1^-)(S2^+ - S2^-)/( -4 ).

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I can use the identity S_i·S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ). So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ ).

Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S1^2 and S2^2 both have eigenvalues 3/4 ħ². So, ⟨S1^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ², same for S2^2.

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) = (1/4)(⟨(S1 + S2)^2⟩ - (3/2) ħ² ).

Therefore, to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, I need to find the expectation of (S1 + S2)^2.

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2. Wait, that's circular because we're trying to find ⟨S1·S2⟩. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible total spin of the first two particles. For two spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin states are S=1 (triplet) and S=0 (singlet). The eigenvalues of S1·S2 are (S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2. Wait, let's see:

We have S1·S2 = ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2. So, if the two particles are in a state with total spin S, then (S1 + S2)^2 = S(S+1)ħ². Therefore, S1·S2 = (S(S+1)ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2 = ( S(S+1) - 3/2 ) ħ² / 2.

So, if the state of particles 1 and 2 is a triplet (S=1), then S1·S2 = (1*2 - 3/2 ) ħ² / 2 = ( (2 - 1.5 ) ) / 2 ħ² = 0.5 / 2 ħ² = ħ²/4.

If the state is a singlet (S=0), S1·S2 = (0 - 3/2 ) / 2 ħ² = (-3/2)/2 ħ² = -3 ħ² /4.

So, in our case, we have the first two particles in the state up1 up2. Let's see what their total spin state is. Up1 up2 is part of the triplet, because the triplet states include |up1 up2⟩, |up1 down2⟩, |down1 up2⟩, and |down1 down2⟩. Wait, actually, no. The state up1 up2 is just one of the possible triplet states. However, in our state psi, we have combinations where the first two particles can be up up, up down, or down up.

Wait, no. The state psi is a combination of three different product states: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3. So, focusing on the first two particles in each term:

1. up1 up2
2. up1 down2
3. down1 up2

So, the first two particles in the three terms are in the states up up, up down, and down up. Each of these is part of the triplet states for particles 1 and 2.

But in the state psi, these are all combined with the same weight. So, the state is a symmetric combination of these three, which suggests that it's a symmetric state with respect to particles 1 and 2.

But wait, each term in psi is a product state where only one particle is down. So, in terms of the first two particles, in each term, either both are up, or one is up and the other is down.

Wait, in the first term, both are up, in the second term, first is up, second is down, in the third term, first is down, second is up. So, all possible combinations where exactly one of the first two particles is down, but in the context of all three particles, the third is varying.

Hmm, I might need a better approach. Maybe considering that the state is symmetric, which could hint at it being a state with a particular total spin.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly by considering all possible terms.

Given that, let me proceed as follows. The state psi is a superposition of three product states: |up1 up2 down3⟩, |up1 down2 up3⟩, |down1 up2 up3⟩, each multiplied by 1/sqrt(3).

So, when I compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, which is (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z), I can compute each term separately.

First, compute ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩. As before, for each product state in psi, S1^z S2^z is (ħ/2)^2 if both are up, -(ħ/2)^2 if one is up and the other is down, and so on.

From the three terms:

1. up1 up2 down3: (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4
2. up1 down2 up3: (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4
3. down1 up2 up3: (-ħ/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ²/4

So, the expectation value is [ (1) + (-1) + (-1) ] * (ħ²/4) / 3 = (-1) * (ħ²/4) / 3 = -ħ²/(12). So, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = -ħ²/12.

Next, compute ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩. Hmm, S1^x and S2^x can be expressed as (S1^+ + S1^-)/2, so S1^x S2^x = (S1^+ + S1^-)(S2^+ + S2^-)/4.

Expanding this, we have four terms: S1^+ S2^+, S1^+ S2^-, S1^- S2^+, S1^- S2^-.

Each of these will act on the product states in psi. Let me compute the expectation of each term.

First, let's compute expectation of S1^+ S2^+.

S1^+ acts on the first particle, and S2^+ acts on the second.

S1^+ | up1 ⟩ = 0, S1^+ | down1 ⟩ = ħ | up1 ⟩.

Similarly, S2^+ | up2 ⟩ = 0, S2^+ | down2 ⟩ = ħ | up2 ⟩.

So, in each term of psi, let's see what S1^+ S2^+ does:

1. S1^+ S2^+ | up1 up2 down3 ⟩ = 0, since both are up.
2. S1^+ S2^+ | up1 down2 up3 ⟩ = S1^+ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^+ | down2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ ħ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0
3. S1^+ S2^+ | down1 up2 up3 ⟩ = S1^+ | down1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^+ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0

So, S1^+ S2^+ acting on any term in psi gives zero. Therefore, the expectation value of S1^+ S2^+ is zero.

Similarly, S1^- S2^- will also give zero because it flips down to up, but in the given state, you can't flip up to down without leaving the state.

Wait, let's check:

1. S1^- S2^- | up1 up2 down3 ⟩ = S1^- | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ 0 ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0
2. S1^- S2^- | up1 down2 up3 ⟩ = S1^- | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | down2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ ħ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 up2 up3 ⟩
3. S1^- S2^- | down1 up2 up3 ⟩ = S1^- | down1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0

So, when we take the inner product with psi, which is a combination of up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3, the only non-zero term is when we act on the second term, which produces | up1 up2 up3 ⟩. But this is orthogonal to the terms in psi, so the inner product is zero.

Therefore, ⟨S1^- S2^-⟩ is zero.

Now, let's consider the cross terms: S1^+ S2^- and S1^- S2^+.

First, S1^+ S2^-:

1. S1^+ S2^- | up1 up2 down3 ⟩ = S1^+ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ ħ | down2 ⟩ ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0
2. S1^+ S2^- | up1 down2 up3 ⟩ = S1^+ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | down2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ 0 ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0
3. S1^+ S2^- | down1 up2 up3 ⟩ = S1^+ | down1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^- | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0

So, all these give zero. Therefore, the expectation value of S1^+ S2^- is zero.

Similarly, for S1^- S2^+:

1. S1^- S2^+ | up1 up2 down3 ⟩ = S1^- | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^+ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ 0 ⊗ | down3 ⟩ = 0
2. S1^- S2^+ | up1 down2 up3 ⟩ = S1^- | up1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^+ | down2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0 ⊗ ħ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 up2 up3 ⟩
3. S1^- S2^+ | down1 up2 up3 ⟩ = S1^- | down1 ⟩ ⊗ S2^+ | up2 ⟩ ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = ħ | up1 ⟩ ⊗ 0 ⊗ | up3 ⟩ = 0

Again, the only non-zero term is the second one, which gives | up1 up2 up3 ⟩, which is orthogonal to the terms in psi, so the inner product is zero. Therefore, ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩ is zero.

Therefore, the cross terms don't contribute to the expectation value. So, the only term left is S1^z S2^z, which we computed earlier as -ħ²/12. Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1^x S2^x⟩ + ⟨S1^y S2^y⟩ + ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = 0 + 0 + (-ħ²/12) = -ħ²/12.

Wait, that seems different from my initial approach where I thought it was part of the triplet state. Let me see.

But previously, I thought about expressing S1·S2 in terms of the total spin, but maybe that approach was flawed because the state isn't just a state of two particles but three, so it's not straightforward to consider S1 + S2 without considering S3.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric, maybe we can use the fact that it's part of the S=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, let me try computing the total spin squared. If I can find ⟨S_total^2⟩, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, in the state psi, we have:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

But each ⟨S_i^2⟩ is (3/4)ħ², so summing them up gives 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Additionally, 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩ = 2*(3⟨S1·S2⟩) = 6⟨S1·S2⟩.

Therefore, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 6⟨S1·S2⟩.

But earlier, I thought that if the state is symmetric, it might be an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 15/4 ħ². Let's check that.

If ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 15/4 ħ², then 15/4 ħ² = 9/4 ħ² + 6⟨S1·S2⟩, which implies 6⟨S1·S2⟩ = 6/4 ħ², so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = 1/4 ħ². But wait, from our earlier computation, we had ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -1/12 ħ², which contradicts this. Therefore, my initial assumption that psi is in the S=3/2 multiplet must be wrong.

So, perhaps the state isn't an eigenstate of S_total^2, which would mean it's not an eigenstate of H either, since H is proportional to S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Alternatively, maybe the state is a mixture of different S_total^2 eigenstates. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but if ⟨S_total^2⟩ is not equal to 15/4 ħ², then the state isn't in the S=3/2 multiplet. Therefore, it's in some other multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a singlet or other spin state.

Wait, let's compute ⟨S_total^2⟩.

From above, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 6⟨S1·S2⟩.

We have ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -1/12 ħ², so:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² + 6*(-1/12 ħ² ) = 9/4 ħ² - 1/2 ħ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² = 7/4 ħ².

Hmm, 7/4 ħ². Let's see, what total spin S would give S(S+1)ħ² = 7/4 ħ².

So S(S+1) = 7/4 → 4S² + 4S -7 =0.

Solving for S: S = [ -4 ± sqrt(16 + 112) ] / 8 = [ -4 ± sqrt(128) ] /8 = [ -4 ± 8*sqrt(2) ] /8. Hmm, that's not a nice number, so it's not an eigenstate of S_total^2. Therefore, the state is not an eigenstate of H, which is built from S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3.

Therefore, since the state isn't an eigenstate of H, we cannot say it's an eigenfunction. Instead, we need to compute the expectation value of H in psi.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and we have ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -1/12 ħ². Similarly, due to symmetry, ⟨S1·S3⟩ and ⟨S2·S3⟩ will also be equal to -1/12 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*( -1/12 ħ² -1/12 ħ² -1/12 ħ² ) = A*(-3/12 ħ² ) = A*(-1/4 ħ² ). Wait, that's negative, but the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, something is wrong here.

Wait, did I make a mistake in computing ⟨S1·S2⟩?

Let me double-check the calculation.

Earlier, I computed ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ as:

In each term of psi, S1^z S2^z is:

1. up up: (ħ/2)^2
2. up down: (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = - (ħ/2)^2
3. down up: (-ħ/2)(ħ/2) = - (ħ/2)^2

So, adding these up: 1 -1 -1 = -1 in terms of (ħ²/4). Therefore, expectation is (-1)*(ħ²/4)/3 = -ħ²/12.

So that seems correct. Then, I considered S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y, but found their expectation values to be zero because of the symmetry.

Wait, that might be incorrect. Because S1^x and S1^y don't commute with the state, so their cross terms might have non-zero contributions when considering the entire state.

Wait, let me think again. When I computed S1^+ S2^- and S1^- S2^+, I saw that they produced | up up up ⟩, which is orthogonal to the terms in psi. So, ⟨psi | S1^+ S2^- | psi ⟩ = 0. Similarly, ⟨psi | S1^- S2^+ | psi ⟩ = 0. Therefore, the expectation values of S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y are zero.

Hence, ⟨S1·S2⟩ is just ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ = -ħ² /12.

But if that's the case, then H would have expectation value -3A ħ² /12 = -A ħ² /4.

But the problem states that the correct answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, my approach must have a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion of S_i·S_j. Let me check.

No, S_i·S_j is indeed (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

Wait, but perhaps I forgot to consider that S1·S2 is an operator, and when you have a state like up1 up2 down3, the action of S1·S2 on this state is not just the product of S1^z S2^z, but also involves other terms.

Wait, but in the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩, I considered all possible terms, including S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y. But I concluded that their contributions are zero because the cross terms only produce | up up up ⟩, which is orthogonal to the state.

But perhaps I should compute the expectation value more directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for three spin-1/2 particles, the state psi is a symmetric state with two up and one down. The number of such states is equal to the number of ways to choose which particle is down, which is 3, so the state is normalized as 1/sqrt(3).

These states are often eigenstates of the total spin in the z-direction, but not necessarily of the total spin squared.

Wait, let me think: the state psi has a definite Sz, since each term has two up and one down, so the total Sz is (2*(1/2) + 1*(-1/2))ħ = (1 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ. So, the state has Sz = ħ/2.

But S_total^2 doesn't necessarily commute with Sz, so the state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 by considering the possible total spin states.

But if the state isn't an eigenstate of S_total^2, then the expectation value would be the weighted average of the possible eigenvalues.

But without knowing the exact decomposition, this might be difficult. So, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, maybe I can consider the Hamiltonian in terms of the total spin.

Given that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2).

As before, each S_i^2 is 3/4 ħ², so:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4 ħ² )) = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ).

So, if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

Earlier, I tried computing ⟨S_total^2⟩ in terms of ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩, but I might have messed up the algebra.

Wait, let's try again.

We know that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, rearranging:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

So, if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

But to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I need to evaluate the expectation value in the state psi.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

I recall that for systems with multiple spins, sometimes it's useful to consider the eigenstates of S_total^2 and Sz. However, in this case, the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, so it's a combination of different S_total^2 eigenstates.

But since the state psi has a definite Sz (which is ħ/2), perhaps it's a mixture of states with different S_total^2.

But I don't know the exact decomposition, so maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩ directly by using the properties of the state.

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding this gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, we can compute the sum of ⟨S1^2⟩, ⟨S2^2⟩, ⟨S3^2⟩, and the cross terms.

But each ⟨S_i^2⟩ is 3/4 ħ², so summing them gives 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, the cross terms: 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). We need to compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, which we have as -1/12 ħ², so 2*(3*(-1/12) ħ
[overthinking]
Alright, I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we have a system of three spin-1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3) times (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, we need to find its energy; if not, we need the expectation value of E. The correct answer, as mentioned, is that it's not an eigenstate, and the expectation value is (2/3) A ħ². I need to figure out why.

First, let me recall some concepts. Spin operators for particles are related to the Pauli matrices. For each spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator Si can be represented as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. So, Si·Sj would be (ħ²/4)(σi·σj). Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be written as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A ħ² / 4)(σ1·σ2 + σ1·σ3 + σ2·σ3).

But maybe it's easier to work with the spin operators directly, without converting to Pauli matrices. The dot product of two spin operators is S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). So, H is A times the sum of these pairwise dot products.

The given state psi is a symmetric combination of three particles, with one spin down and two spins up, each in a different position. It's symmetric in the sense that each particle has a chance to be the one that's down, so the state is symmetric under permutation of particles.

Now, to determine if psi is an eigenstate of H, we can check whether H psi = E psi for some scalar E. If not, then the expectation value is just the average value of H in the state psi.

Since the problem states that it's not an eigenstate, but the expectation value is (2/3) A ħ², I need to compute the expectation value of H in the state psi.

But how do I compute that? Let's think. The state psi is a linear combination of three basis states: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩. So, when I act with H on psi, I need to find the expectation value by taking the inner product of psi with H psi, which is equivalent to summing over all possible basis states and their contributions.

But maybe rather than computing H psi directly, which could be complicated, I can compute the expectation value of each term in H separately: S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3. Since H is the sum of these, the expectation value of H is the sum of the expectation values of each term.

So, let me denote each term as H12 = S1·S2, H13 = S1·S3, and H23 = S2·S3. Then, H = A*(H12 + H13 + H23).

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨H12⟩ + ⟨H13⟩ + ⟨H23⟩).

So, if I can compute each ⟨Hi j⟩, I can add them up and multiply by A to get the expectation value.

Let me first compute ⟨H12⟩. That is, the expectation value of S1·S2 in the state psi.

Wait, but S1·S2 is an operator that acts on particles 1 and 2, leaving particle 3 untouched. Similarly, S1·S3 acts on particles 1 and 3, and S2·S3 acts on particles 2 and 3.

So, since our state psi is symmetric, maybe the expectation values for each of these terms will be the same?

Wait, but let me check. Each of the three terms H12, H13, H23 is similar but acts on different pairs. Since our state is symmetric, it should give the same expectation value for each of these terms. So, perhaps ⟨H12⟩ = ⟨H13⟩ = ⟨H23⟩, so that ⟨H⟩ = 3*A*⟨H12⟩.

Therefore, if I compute ⟨H12⟩, I can just multiply by 3*A to get the expectation value of H.

So, let's focus on computing ⟨H12⟩ = ⟨psi | H12 | psi⟩.

But H12 = S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z). Hmm, but maybe it's easier to recall that S1·S2 can be written in terms of total spin operators.

Wait, for two particles, the total spin squared is S_total² = (S1 + S2)² = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

But for spin-1/2 particles, S1² = (3/4) ħ², same for S2². So, S1·S2 = [S_total² - (3/4) ħ² - (3/4) ħ²]/2 = [S_total² - (3/2) ħ²]/2.

Therefore, H12 = (S1·S2) = [S_total² - (3/4) ħ²]/2.

Wait, no, let's be careful.

Wait, S1² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². Similarly for S2².

So, S_total² = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2. Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2 = [S_total² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²]/2 = [S_total² - (3/2) ħ²]/2.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total² - (3/2) ħ²)/2.

So, if I can compute the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi, then I can find ⟨H12⟩.

But wait, what is the total spin of the state psi? Since it's a combination of states with one spin down and two spins up, let's think about the total spin.

Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. Let me think about the possible total spin states.

But wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can range from 3/2 down to 1/2. However, the state psi is a symmetric combination of states with one spin down. Let me recall that the symmetric states under permutation of particles correspond to certain total spin states.

Wait, in the case of three spin-1/2 particles, the totally symmetric state (which is the state we have here) has a total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2. Hmm, but actually, I think that the completely symmetric state can be either S=3/2 or S=1/2, depending on the combination. But in our case, our state is symmetric but not the completely symmetric state.

Wait, actually, perhaps not. Let me think. The state psi is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. Because if I swap particles 1 and 2, the state becomes up2 up1 down3 + up2 down1 up3 + down2 up1 up3, which is the same as the original state. Similarly for other swaps. So, yes, it's fully symmetric.

Therefore, the state belongs to the symmetric subspace of the three-spin system, which has total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2. Now, the highest weight state in the S=3/2 representation is |↑↑↑⟩. Our state is orthogonal to that because it has one spin down. So, it must belong to the S=1/2 representation.

Therefore, the total spin squared S_total² = (S(S+1)) ħ², where S=1/2, so S_total² = (3/4) ħ². Therefore, the expectation value of S_total² in the state psi is (3/4) ħ².

Wait, but hold on. Wait, the state psi is not the total spin state. It's a state that's symmetric, but is it an eigenstate of S_total²? Because I'm assuming that all symmetric states with one spin down have S=1/2. But perhaps in reality, the state is a combination of different spin states.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Because even if the state is symmetric, it might not be an eigenstate of S_total². So, maybe I can't directly use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 directly, without going through the total spin.

Let me write out the state psi:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

So, let's compute ⟨psi | H12 | psi⟩.

H12 = S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)

But perhaps it's easier to compute this in terms of expectation values. Remember that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 can take two possible values: (1/4 ħ²) if the two spins are in a triplet state (S=1) and (-3/4 ħ²) if they're in a singlet state (S=0). Wait, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of S1·S2 are (S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (S(S+1) - 3/2)/2.

Wait, so for S=1, S1·S2 = (1*(1+1) - 3/2)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 1/4 ħ². For S=0, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/2)/2 = (-3/2)/2 = -3/4 ħ².

But in our case, we have three particles, so the spins aren't just two particles. Hmm, perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, another approach is to note that S1·S2 can be written in terms of the spin matrices, and then compute the expectation value by acting on each basis state in psi.

So, let's recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 can be computed as:

S1·S2 = (1/4)(σ1·σ2) ħ².

But since we are working in the basis of |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩ for particles 1 and 2, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 for each state is known.

In particular, for |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3 (actually, the expectation value would be the sum of expectation values of σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z. For |↑↑⟩, each component gives 1, so the sum is 3. Similarly, for |↓↓⟩, it's also 3, because σz gives -1 for each, but (-1)*(-1)=1 for each component, so sum is 3. For |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩, the expectation value is -3, because σz would be 1 and -1, so (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + etc., but wait, no, actually:

Wait, hold on, for |↑↓⟩, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x is ⟨↑|σ1^x|↑⟩ ⟨↓|σ2^x|↓⟩. But σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ1^x |↑⟩ = 0. Similarly, σ2^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ2^x |↓⟩ = 0. So, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x is 0. Similarly, expectation values for σ1^y σ2^y and σ1^z σ2^z are 0 as well? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, actually, for |↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z. So, compute each term:

⟨↑|σ1^x |↑⟩ = 0, as σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, so inner product is zero. Similarly, σ2^x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ2^x |↓⟩ = 0. Therefore, the expectation value of σ1^x σ2^x is 0.

Similarly, σ1^y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ1^y |↑⟩ = 0, and σ2^y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ2^y |↓⟩ = 0. Therefore, the expectation value of σ1^y σ2^y is also 0.

Finally, σ1^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σ1^z |↑⟩ = +1, and σ2^z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩, so ⟨↓|σ2^z |↓⟩ = -1. So, the expectation value of σ1^z σ2^z is (+1)*(-1) = -1.

Therefore, the total expectation value of σ1·σ2 for |↑↓⟩ is 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1.

Similarly, for |↓↑⟩, it would also be -1.

Wait, so for the two-particle states:

- |↑↑⟩: σ1·σ2 = 3
- |↓↓⟩: σ1·σ2 = 3
- |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩: σ1·σ2 = -1

So, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 for our basis states is either 3 or -1.

Therefore, going back to S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2). So, S1·S2 has eigenvalues (3/4) ħ² and (-1/4) ħ² for these states.

Now, for each term in the state psi, we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

Since our state psi is a sum of three basis states, each of which is |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and |↓↑↑⟩. Let me note that in each of these, the first two spins (for H12) are either |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, or |↓↑⟩.

So, let's compute the expectation value of H12 = S1·S2 in each basis state:

1. For |↑↑↓⟩: The first two spins are |↑↑⟩, so σ1·σ2 = 3. Thus, S1·S2 = (3/4) ħ².

2. For |↑↓↑⟩: The first two spins are |↑↓⟩, so σ1·σ2 = -1. Thus, S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

3. For |↓↑↑⟩: The first two spins are |↓↑⟩, so σ1·σ2 = -1. Thus, S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H12 in each basis state is either (3/4) ħ² or (-1/4) ħ².

But since the state psi is a superposition, we can compute ⟨H12⟩ as the average over all contributions.

Wait, actually, no. Because when you compute the expectation value of H12 in the state psi, you have to take into account the coefficients and the cross terms.

Wait, let's think. The expectation value ⟨psi | H12 | psi⟩ is equal to the sum of the diagonal terms plus the cross terms. So, not just the average of each term, but rather, we need to compute each part.

Let me write out the state psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) ( |a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩ )

where |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Then, ⟨H12⟩ = (1/3) [ ⟨a| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |c⟩ ]

So, it's 1/3 times the sum over all these terms.

Now, let's compute each term.

First, the diagonal terms:

1. ⟨a| H12 |a⟩: For |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, H12 |a⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |a⟩. So, this term is (3/4) ħ².

2. ⟨b| H12 |b⟩: For |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, H12 |b⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |b⟩. So, this term is (-1/4) ħ².

3. ⟨c| H12 |c⟩: For |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩, H12 |c⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |c⟩. So, this term is (-1/4) ħ².

Now, the cross terms. Let's consider ⟨a| H12 |b⟩: H12 acts on the first two spins of |b⟩, which are |↑↓⟩, so H12 |b⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |b⟩. Therefore, ⟨a| H12 |b⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² ⟨a|b⟩. But ⟨a|b⟩ is zero because |a⟩ and |b⟩ are orthogonal (different states). Similarly, all cross terms where the states are orthogonal will vanish.

But wait, wait a second. H12 is only acting on particles 1 and 2, so when we have ⟨a| H12 |b⟩, we need to see if H12 |b⟩ has any overlap with |a⟩.

Wait, |b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩, so H12 |b⟩ = S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ |↑⟩. S1·S2 |↑↓⟩ is (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓⟩, so H12 |b⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |b⟩.

Therefore, ⟨a| H12 |b⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² ⟨a|b⟩ = 0.

Similarly, all cross terms where the states are different will be zero because |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩ are orthogonal.

Therefore, the only contributions are the diagonal terms. So, adding them up:

⟨H12⟩ = (1/3) [ (3/4) ħ² + (-1/4) ħ² + (-1/4) ħ² ] = (1/3) [ (3/4 - 1/4 - 1/4) ħ² ] = (1/3)(1/4 ħ²) = (1/12) ħ².

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because each of the three terms contributes, and two of them are negative. Wait, 3/4 minus 1/4 minus 1/4 is indeed (3 -1 -1)/4 = 1/4. So, 1/4 divided by 3 is 1/12. So, ⟨H12⟩ = (1/12) ħ².

Similarly, because of the symmetry, ⟨H13⟩ and ⟨H23⟩ will also be equal to (1/12) ħ² each.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨H12⟩ + ⟨H13⟩ + ⟨H23⟩) = A*(1/12 + 1/12 + 1/12) ħ² = A*(3/12) ħ² = A*(1/4) ħ².

Wait, hold on, that's different from the given answer, which is (2/3) A ħ². So, clearly, I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let's go back step by step.

First, when I computed ⟨H12⟩, I considered only the diagonal terms because the cross terms are zero. So, I computed:

⟨H12⟩ = (1/3)[ (3/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] ħ² = (1/12) ħ².

But let's verify that computation.

Wait, |a⟩ is |↑↑↓⟩, which has H12 eigenvalue 3/4.

|b⟩ is |↑↓↑⟩, which has H12 eigenvalue -1/4.

|c⟩ is |↓↑↑⟩, which has H12 eigenvalue -1/4.

So, when we compute ⟨a| H12 |a⟩, it's (3/4) ħ².

⟨b| H12 |b⟩ is (-1/4) ħ².

⟨c| H12 |c⟩ is (-1/4) ħ².

So, adding these three: 3/4 - 1/4 -1/4 = 1/4.

Then, multiplied by 1/3, gives 1/12 ħ².

So, that seems correct.

But then, if each of the three terms H12, H13, H23 contributes 1/12 ħ², then the total expectation value is 3 * (1/12) = 1/4 ħ² times A, so (A/4) ħ².

But the correct answer is (2/3) A ħ², so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition of H12. Because H12 is S1·S2, which is (1/4)(σ1·σ2) ħ², but in my earlier calculation, I think I might have confused the scaling.

Wait, let's go back.

The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, so S1·S2 = (ħ²/4) σ1·σ2.

Therefore, S1·S2 in terms of σ1·σ2 is indeed (ħ²/4)(σ1·σ2).

So, when I found that for |↑↑⟩, σ1·σ2 = 3, so S1·S2 = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓⟩, σ1·σ2 = -1, so S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Therefore, the computation was correct.

But then, my final expectation value is (A/4) ħ², which contradicts the given answer of (2/3) A ħ². So, clearly, there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I didn't consider that H12, H13, and H23 are not only acting on two particles but the third particle can be up or down. Wait, no, in H12, only particles 1 and 2 are involved, particle 3 is untouched, so in the state |↑↑↓⟩, the third particle is down, but H12 doesn't act on it.

Wait, but in the state |↑↑↓⟩, H12 acts on the first two particles, which are up, so S1·S2 = (3/4) ħ².

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, H12 acts on the first two particles, which are up and down, so S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Same for |↓↑↑⟩: first two particles are down and up, so S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H12⟩ is indeed (1/12) ħ².

But why the discrepancy with the expected answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that ⟨H12⟩ = ⟨H13⟩ = ⟨H23⟩. Let me check.

Wait, our state psi is symmetric under permutation of particles. Therefore, ⟨H12⟩ = ⟨H13⟩ = ⟨H23⟩.

So, that should be correct.

Therefore, if ⟨H12⟩ = (1/12) ħ², then ⟨H⟩ = 3*(1/12) = (1/4) ħ² * A, which is (A/4) ħ². But this is not matching the given answer of (2/3) A ħ².

So, where's the error?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ⟨H12⟩.

Wait, let me try computing the expectation value of H12 in a different way.

H12 = S1·S2 = (1/4)(σ1·σ2) ħ². So, for the state |↑↑↓⟩, which is |↑↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩, H12 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩, which is |↑↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩, H12 |↑↓↑⟩ = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑⟩.

Same for |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, when I compute ⟨psi | H12 | psi⟩, it's (1/3)^2 [ ⟨a| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |c⟩ ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because psi is (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3). Therefore, when we compute ⟨psi | H12 | psi⟩, it's (1/3) times [ ⟨a| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨a| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |c⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |c⟩ ].

But as we saw, all the cross terms ⟨a| H12 |b⟩, etc., are zero because H12 |b⟩ is proportional to |b⟩, and |a⟩ and |b⟩ are orthogonal.

Therefore, only the diagonal terms survive:

⟨H12⟩ = (1/3)[ ⟨a| H12 |a⟩ + ⟨b| H12 |b⟩ + ⟨c| H12 |c⟩ ] = (1/3)[ (3/4) ħ² + (-1/4) ħ² + (-1/4) ħ² ] = (1/3)(1/4 ħ²) = (1/12) ħ².

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but then the total expectation value is (3/12) ħ² A = (1/4) ħ² A, which is not matching.

Wait, is there a miscalculation in the eigenvalues?

Wait, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (S=0) has S1·S2 = (-3/4) ħ², and the triplet states (S=1) have S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ².

But in our case, when the two spins are both up, they are in a triplet state, so S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

When they are up and down, they are in a singlet state, S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ².

Wait, wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, let's double-check. The total spin S for two spin-1/2 particles is either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). For S=1, S1·S2 = [S_total² - S1² - S2²]/2. S_total² = 2(2+1)/4 ħ²? Wait, no, S_total² = S(S+1) ħ².

Wait, for S=1, S_total² = 2 ħ². S1² = 3/4 ħ², S2² = 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 1/4 ħ².

For S=0, S_total² = 0. So, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -3/4 ħ².

So, yes, that's correct.

But when we have two spins up, they are in a triplet state, so S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

When they are up and down, in a singlet state, S1·S2 = -3/4 ħ².

Wait, but in my earlier computation, I considered |↑↑⟩ as having S1·S2 = 3/4 ħ², which is incorrect. It should be 1/4 ħ².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, where did I get 3/4 from?

Wait, when I was computing σ1·σ2 for |↑↑⟩, I said σ1·σ2 = 3, so S1·S2 = (3/4) ħ². But that contradicts the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the definitions. Let me get this straight.

The Pauli matrices σ have eigenvalues ±1. For two spins, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 for |↑↑⟩ is 3, as computed earlier. Therefore, S1·S2 = (σ1·σ2) ħ² /4, so for |↑↑⟩, S1·S2 = (3) * ħ² /4 = 3/4 ħ². But according to the total spin approach, it should be 1/4 ħ².

This is a contradiction. So, which one is correct?

Wait, let's think again.

For two spin-1/2 particles:

If both are up (|↑↑⟩), their total spin can be S=1, m=1.

Similarly, |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ and |↓↓⟩ can be in S=1 or S=0.

Wait, specifically, the |↑↑⟩ is part of the S=1 triplet. The singlet state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2). So, |↑↑⟩ is in the triplet, so S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

Wait, but the expectation value computed through σ1·σ2 was 3, leading to S1·S2 = 3/4 ħ².

So, which is correct?

Wait, let me compute S1·S2 for |↑↑⟩.

S1·S2 = (1/4)(σ1·σ2).

So, for |↑↑⟩:

σ1^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ1^y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ1^z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩.

Similarly for σ2.

So, σ1·σ2 = σ1^x σ2^x + σ1^y σ2^y + σ1^z σ2^z.

Compute each term:

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↑⟩ = σ1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ σ2^x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1^y σ2^y |↑↑⟩ = (i|↓⟩) ⊗ (i|↓⟩) = (-1)|↓↓⟩.

σ1^z σ2^z |↑↑⟩ = |↑⟩⊗|↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↓↓⟩ - |↓↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = ⟨↑↑|↑↑⟩ = 1.

Therefore, S1·S2 |↑↑⟩ = (1/4) |↑↑⟩, so the expectation value is 1/4 ħ².

Wait, but earlier I thought σ1·σ2 for |↑↑⟩ was 3, but that must have been incorrect.

Wait, let's compute ⟨↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩:

As above, σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩ + (terms that are orthogonal). Wait, actually, we saw that σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↑↑| σ1·σ2 |↑↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly, for |↓↓⟩, σ1·σ2 |↓↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩, so ⟨↓↓| σ1·σ2 |↓↓⟩ = 1.

For |↑↓⟩, compute σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩:

σ1^x σ2^x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

σ1^y σ2^y |↑↓⟩ = (-i)(i)|↓↑⟩ = (-i^2)|↓↑⟩ = |-1 * (-1)|↓↑⟩ = |↓↑⟩,

σ1^z σ2^z |↑↓⟩ = ( -1 * -1 ) |↑↓⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

So, σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩ + |↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ = 2|↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩.

Therefore, ⟨↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓| 2|↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ = 0 + 1 =1.

Wait, but that can't be, because |↑↓⟩ and |↓↑⟩ are orthogonal.

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, wait, no. To compute ⟨↑↓| σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩, I need to compute the inner product.

But σ1·σ2 |↑↓⟩
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H and, if not, compute the expectation value of H. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, let's write down the Hamiltonian. It's given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and Si are the spin operators for each particle. Each particle is spin-1/2, so the spin operators for each particle will have components like Sx, Sy, Sz, and the dot product S1·S2 would be S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z.

The state psi is given as (1/sqrt(3)) [up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3]. This is a symmetric state because it's a combination of all possible states where exactly two spins are up and one is down. So, it's a symmetric combination under exchange of particles.

Now, the question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H. To check that, I need to see if H acting on psi gives a scalar multiple of psi. If it does, then psi is an eigenstate, and the scalar would be the eigenvalue (energy). If not, then we have to compute the expectation value.

But before jumping into that, maybe it's useful to recall some properties of spin systems and the operators involved.

Each S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin operators. Remember that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if we solve for the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, we get:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2.

So the Hamiltonian can be written as H = A*( [S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2 ).

Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for each particle. So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²).

So, if we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi, we can find the expectation value of H.

Alternatively, since H is expressed in terms of the pairwise spin interactions, perhaps it's easier to compute H in terms of the triplet and singlet states for each pair.

But let me think. The state psi is a combination of three states, each with two spins up and one down. So, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total possible states are 2^3 = 8. The state psi is a symmetric combination of three of them. So, let's think about the total spin S_total.

The total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2 because we're dealing with three spin-1/2 particles. The state psi is a state with two spins up and one down. Let's see what the total spin could be.

Wait, to compute S_total^2, we might need to figure out what the total spin state is. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of each S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 individually.

So, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of their total spin. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2).

Wait, that's a general formula: for two operators, S_i·S_j = (S_{i} + S_{j})^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So, similar to the total spin.

But in this case, we have three spins, so perhaps it's more complicated, but since the Hamiltonian is the sum over all pairs, maybe we can compute each pair's expectation value and add them up.

So, perhaps the expectation value of H is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Therefore, if I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 for the state psi, then I can sum them up and multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

So, let me compute each expectation value.

First, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

But S1·S2 = S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z.

So, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ is ⟨psi| S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z |psi⟩.

Similarly for the other terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in terms of the total spin.

For two particles, S1·S2 = (S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

But in this case, we have three particles, so the total spin S_total is S1 + S2 + S3. So, S_{12} = S1 + S2. Hmm, so S_{12}^2 can be considered as part of S_total^2.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated because the operators are intertwined.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value directly.

Let me write down the state psi more explicitly.

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |up1 up2 down3⟩ + |up1 down2 up3⟩ + |down1 up2 up3⟩ ].

So, it's a symmetric state in the sense that any two particles can be swapped, and the state remains the same up to a permutation of terms.

So, perhaps for ⟨S1·S2⟩, let's compute the expectation value.

First, note that S1·S2 is a sum of products of the spin components.

Alternatively, since the state is symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2, maybe the expectation value would be the same for each pair.

Wait, but the state isn't symmetric under exchange of all three particles; it's symmetric under exchange of any two. Wait, no, actually, if you swap, say, particle 1 and 2, the term |up1 up2 down3⟩ becomes |up2 up1 down3⟩, which is the same as |up1 up2 down3⟩, so that term remains the same. Similarly, |up1 down2 up3⟩ becomes |up2 down1 up3⟩, which is the same as |up2 down1 up3⟩, which is another term in the state. Wait, actually, the state is a combination where each term has exactly two up spins and one down spin. So, swapping two particles just permutes the terms, so the state remains the same. Therefore, the state is symmetric under permutation of any two particles.

Therefore, the expectation values for S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 should all be equal. Therefore, the expectation value of H would be A*(3⟨S1·S2⟩).

So, if I can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, then I can just multiply by 3 and get the expectation value of H.

So, let's compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Given that S1·S2 = (1/4)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

But since each S_i is spin-1/2, S1^2 = (3/4)ħ² and S2^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, S1·S2 = [ (S_{12}^2 ) / ħ² - 3/4 - 3/4 ] * ħ² / 4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_{12}^2 - (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² ) / 2 ħ² ?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write S1·S2 = [ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2.

So, in terms of ħ², since S_i^2 = (s(s+1))ħ² where s=1/2, so S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ².

So, S1·S2 = [ S_{12}^2 - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² ] / 2.

So, S1·S2 = [ S_{12}^2 - (3/2)ħ² ] / 2.

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S1·S2⟩ is [ ⟨S_{12}^2⟩ - (3/2)ħ² ] / 2.

So, if I can compute ⟨S_{12}^2⟩, then I can find ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Now, what is S_{12}^2 in the state psi?

Let's recall that S_{12}^2 is the square of the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

In the state psi, we have two up spins and one down spin. Let's focus on particles 1 and 2.

In each term of psi, particles 1 and 2 can be both up, or one up and one down.

Let's consider each term:

1. |up1 up2 down3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their total spin is S_{12} = 1 (since two spin-1/2 particles can combine to spin 1 or 0).

2. |up1 down2 up3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so their total spin could be 1/2.

3. |down1 up2 up3⟩: similar to the second term, particles 1 and 2 are down and up, so their total spin is 1/2.

So, in the state psi, the combination of particles 1 and 2 can be in either spin 1 or spin 1/2 states.

Therefore, S_{12}^2 can take values (1)(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ² for the first term, and (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for the second and third terms.

So, let's compute the expectation value ⟨S_{12}^2⟩.

The state psi is a sum of three terms, each with equal weight (1/sqrt(3)).

So, let's compute the expectation value for each term:

1. For the term |up1 up2 down3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are in a spin 1 state. So, S_{12}^2 = 2ħ².

2. For the term |up1 down2 up3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are in a spin 1/2 state. So, S_{12}^2 = (3/4)ħ².

3. Similarly, for the term |down1 up2 up3⟩: same as the second term, S_{12}^2 = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, when we compute ⟨S_{12}^2⟩ over the state psi, we have contributions from each term.

Since psi is a symmetric combination, each term contributes equally.

But wait, the state is normalized with 1/sqrt(3), so each term has a coefficient 1/sqrt(3).

Therefore, the expectation value is (1/3)[2ħ² + (3/4)ħ² + (3/4)ħ²].

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, actually, the expectation value is the sum over the probabilities times the corresponding S_{12}^2 values.

But since the state psi is a sum of three orthogonal terms, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(3), the probability of each term is (1/3).

Therefore, the expectation value is (1/3)(2ħ²) + (1/3)(3/4 ħ²) + (1/3)(3/4 ħ²).

So, let me compute that:

(1/3)(2) + (1/3)(3/4) + (1/3)(3/4) = (2/3) + (1/4) + (1/4) = (2/3) + (1/2) = (4/6 + 3/6) = 7/6.

Wait, so ⟨S_{12}^2⟩ = (7/6)ħ².

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, each term in the sum contributes (1/3) * value.

First term: (1/3)*2 = 2/3.

Second term: (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4.

Third term: same as second, 1/4.

Adding them up: 2/3 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/3 + 1/2 = (4/6 + 3/6) = 7/6.

Yes, that seems right.

So, ⟨S_{12}^2⟩ = (7/6)ħ².

Therefore, going back to ⟨S1·S2⟩.

We had:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [⟨S_{12}^2⟩ - (3/2)ħ²]/2.

Plugging in the numbers:

[ (7/6)ħ² - (3/2)ħ² ] / 2 = [ (7/6 - 9/6)ħ² ] / 2 = [ (-2/6)ħ² ] / 2 = [ (-1/3)ħ² ] / 2 = (-1/6)ħ².

Wait, that can't be right because the expectation value is negative, which might be possible, but let me verify the calculations.

Wait, S1·S2 = (S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

But wait, S1·S2 = [ S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2.

So, substituting in numbers:

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [ (7/6 ħ² ) - (3/4 ħ² ) - (3/4 ħ² ) ] / 2.

So, that's [ (7/6 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) ħ² ] / 2.

Compute 7/6 - 3/4 -3/4.

Convert to twelfths:

7/6 = 14/12.

3/4 = 9/12.

So, 14/12 - 9/12 -9/12 = (14 - 9 - 9)/12 = (-4)/12 = -1/3.

So, we have [ (-1/3) ħ² ] / 2 = (-1/6) ħ².

So, yes, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (-1/6) ħ².

Therefore, since the expectation value for each pair is the same, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = (-1/6) ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value of H is A*( (-1/6) ħ² + (-1/6) ħ² + (-1/6) ħ² ) = A*( -1/2 ħ² ).

Wait, that can't be right because the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)( S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

But in the expression for H, H = A*( S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, each S_i·S_j term is computed as above.

But in the calculation above, I computed S1·S2 as [ S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ] / 2, which is correct.

So, substituting the numbers:

S1·S2 = (7/6 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2 = (7/6 - 3/4 - 3/4 ) / 2 ħ².

Compute 7/6 - 3/4 -3/4:

7/6 = 14/12.

3/4 = 9/12.

So, 14/12 - 9/12 -9/12 = (14 - 18)/12 = (-4)/12 = -1/3.

So, S1·S2 = (-1/3)/2 ħ² = (-1/6) ħ².

Therefore, each pair has expectation value (-1/6) ħ².

Therefore, the total expectation value is 3*(-1/6) ħ² = (-1/2) ħ².

But the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have a sign error.

Wait, let's double-check the formula.

S_i·S_j = (1/2)( S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe compute S_total^2 for the state psi.

Because if I can compute S_total^2, then H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² )

So, if I compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, let me try that approach.

S_total^2 is (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

Therefore, S_total^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, rearranging:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = A*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2.

So, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)( ⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² )

So, if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

So, what is ⟨S_total^2⟩ for the state psi?

Let me think about the total spin.

The state psi is a combination of three states where two spins are up and one is down. So, the possible total spin states could be either S_total = 3/2 or S_total = 1/2.

But to find out, let's compute S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

Wait, let me think about the state psi.

The state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles, so it must be a member of a spin multiplet with definite S_total.

But what is S_total in this case?

Wait, three spin-1/2 particles can combine to total spin 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi has two spins up and one down. The total spin projection is (2*(+1/2) + (-1/2)) = (2 -1)/2 = 1/2.

So, the state has S_z = 1/2. Therefore, the possible S_total can be 3/2 or 1/2. To find out which one it is, let's see if the state is in a triplet or a quintet.

But perhaps it's easier to compute S_total^2.

Let's compute S_total^2 |psi⟩.

But computing S_total^2 is complicated because it involves the sum of all spin operators. Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps for each term in psi, compute S_total^2.

Let's take a term like |up1 up2 down3⟩.

Compute S_total^2 for this term.

For this term, particles 1 and 2 are up, so their spins are +1/2.

Particle 3 is down, so spin -1/2.

So, the total spin is S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

The eigenvalue of S_total^2 for this term would be ( (1/2 + 1/2 + (-1/2) ) ( (1/2 + 1/2 + (-1/2) ) + 1 ) ) ħ² ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The total spin S_total can be determined by combining the spins step by step.

First, combine S1 and S2: they can form a spin 1 or 0 state.

Then, combine that with S3.

But in the state |up1 up2 down3⟩, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so they form a spin 1 state. Then, combining that with S3 = down gives a total spin which could be 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 or 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So, the state |up1 up2 down3⟩ is part of both the S_total = 3/2 and S_total = 1/2 multiplets.

Similarly, the other terms in psi are |up1 down2 up3⟩ and |down1 up2 up3⟩, which are also part of both multiplets.

Therefore, the state psi is a combination of states from both S_total = 3/2 and S_total = 1/2 multiplets. Therefore, it is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, and thus not an eigenstate of H.

Therefore, to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, we can express psi as a combination of eigenstates of S_total^2.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value directly.

Let me compute S_total^2 |psi⟩.

S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨psi| S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) |psi⟩.

But S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ² for each particle.

So, ⟨S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2⟩ = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

And we already computed ⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩ = 3*(-1/6)ħ² = (-1/2)ħ².

So, putting it all together:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(-1/2)ħ² = (9/4 - 1)ħ² = (5/4)ħ².

Therefore, going back to H:

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)( ⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(5/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)( -4/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)(-ħ²) = (-A/2)ħ².

Wait, that's negative. But the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go back step by step.

We have:

H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² )

So, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)( ⟨S_total^2⟩ - 9/4 ħ² )

We computed ⟨S_total^2⟩ as 5/4 ħ². Therefore,

⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(5/4 - 9/4) ħ² = (A/2)(-4/4) ħ² = (-A/2) ħ².

But the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, clearly, I have a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up in the calculation of ⟨S_total^2⟩.

Let me recalculate ⟨S_total^2⟩.

We have:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨psi| S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) |psi⟩.

We know that S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

We also have S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ] / 2.

Wait, but we are trying to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, so perhaps we need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe compute S_total^2 directly.

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the expectation value of each term in S_total^2.

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. So, expanding it, we have S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ).

So, to compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, we need to find the expectation value of each of these terms.

We have already found that S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 gives 9/4 ħ².

And 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) gives 2*(-1/2) ħ² = -1 ħ².

Therefore, total ⟨S_total^2⟩ = (9/4 - 1) ħ² = 5/4 ħ².

But that gives us ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(5/4 - 9/4) = (-A/2) ħ², which contradicts the given answer.

Wait, perhaps I have a sign error in the expression for H.

Wait, let's go back to the original definition.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

And S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )) / 2.

So, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 )

So, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ²

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)⟨S_total^2⟩ - (9A/8) ħ².

But we found ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 5/4 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(5/4 ħ²) - (9A/8) ħ² = (5A/8 ħ²) - (9A/8 ħ²) = (-4A/8) ħ² = (-A/2) ħ².

Again, same result. So, the expectation value is negative, but the given answer is positive. So, I must have messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing ⟨S1·S2⟩.

Let me go back.

Earlier, I computed ⟨S1·S2⟩ as (-1/6) ħ². But perhaps that's incorrect.

Let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ directly.

We have:

S1·S2 = (1/4)( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

So, in terms of eigenvalues, for two spin-1/2 particles, S1 + S2 can be 0 or 1.

The possible eigenvalues of S_{12}^2 are 0*(0+1)ħ² = 0 and 1*(1+1)ħ² = 2 ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 = [ S_{12}^2 - (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² ] / 2 = [ S_{12}^2 - (3/2) ħ² ] / 2.

So, when S_{12}^2 = 2 ħ², S1·S2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5/2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

When S_{12}^2 = 0, S1·S2 = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -3/4 ħ².

Therefore, in the state psi, for each term, we can compute the value of S1·S2.

Looking at the state psi, which is (1/sqrt(3)) [ |up1 up2 down3⟩ + |up1 down2 up3⟩ + |down1 up2 up3⟩ ].

Each term corresponds to a specific configuration of spins.

For |up1 up2 down3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their total spin is 1. Therefore, S_{12}^2 = 2 ħ², so S1·S2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5/2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

For |up1 down2 up3⟩: particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so their total spin is 1/2. Therefore, S_{12}^2 = 0.75 ħ², so S1·S2 = (0.75 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = (-0.75)/2 ħ² = -3/8 ħ².

Similarly, for |down1 up2 up3⟩: same as above, S1·S2 = -3/8 ħ².

Therefore, in the state psi, each term contributes to ⟨S1·S2⟩ as follows:

The first term: (1/3) * (1/4) ħ².

The second term: (1/3) * (-3/8) ħ².

The third term: (1/3) * (-3/8) ħ².

So, total ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/3)(1/4) + (1/3)(-3/8) + (1/3)(-3/8) = (1/12) - (1/8) - (1/8).

Compute in twelfths:

1/12 - 3/24 - 3/24 = 1/12 - 6/24 = 1/12 - 1/4 = (1 - 3)/12 = (-2)/12 = -1/6 ħ².

So, same result as before. Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -1/6 ħ².

So, seems correct. But then the expectation value of H is negative, which contradicts the given answer.

Wait, but the given answer is positive 2/3 A ħ². So, perhaps I have a sign error in the definition of H.

Wait, in the problem statement, H is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ). So, positive A times the sum.

But in our calculation, the expectation value is negative.

But the given answer is positive. So, perhaps we have a sign error.

Wait, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of H with positive energy, but our calculation suggests negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the expansion of S1·S2.

Wait, let me recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)( S_{ij}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 )

Therefore, S1·S2 = (1/2)( S_{12}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

Which gives S1·S2 = (1/2)( S_{12}^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) = (1/2)( S_{12}^2 - 1.5 ħ² )

So, when S_{12}^2 = 2 ħ², S1·S2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5 / 2 ħ² = 1/4 ħ².

When S_{12}^2 = 0, S1·S2 = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -3/4 ħ².

Wait, that seems correct.

But, in the state psi, for each term, S1·S2 is either 1/4 ħ² or -3/8 ħ².

Wait, but in the term |up1 down2 up3⟩, S1·S2 is -3/8 ħ², not -3/4 ħ². Because S_{12}^2 is 3/4 ħ².

Wait, hold on, no. S1·S2 is [ S_{12}^2 - 3/4 - 3/4 ] / 2.

So, if S_{12}^2 = 3/4 ħ², then S1·S2 = (3/4 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (-3/4)/2 ħ² = -3/8 ħ².

Yes, that's correct.

So, the calculation is correct, but the expectation value comes out negative.

But the given answer is positive. So, maybe I need to check if I misapplied the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have a factor of 2 wrong in the expansion.

Wait, S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 )

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )) / 2.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 ) = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 )

So, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9 A / 8 ) ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2) ⟨S_total^2⟩ - (9 A / 8 ) ħ².

But we computed ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 5/4 ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = (A/2)(5/4) ħ² - (9
[overthinking]
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is a superposition of three terms: up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, and down1 up2 up3, all normalized by 1/sqrt(3). 

First, I need to recall what it means for a state to be an eigenfunction of an operator. If H psi = E psi for some scalar E, then psi is an eigenstate with eigenvalue E. If not, then it's not an eigenstate, and we can still find the expectation value of H by computing <psi|H|psi>.

Since the Hamiltonian is a sum of terms involving the dot product of spin operators, let me remember that the dot product S_i · S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin operators. Specifically, S_i · S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2), where S_{i,j} is the total spin when combining particles i and j. Alternatively, since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ² for each particle.

But maybe a more straightforward approach is to compute S_i · S_j in terms of their individual components. Recall that S_i · S_j = S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z. 

Given that, perhaps I can compute each term S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 for the given state psi, and then see if H acts on psi in a way proportional to psi. If it does, then it's an eigenstate; if not, we can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, maybe symmetry can help. The state psi is symmetric in all three particles in some way. Let me see: it's a symmetric combination where exactly two spins are up and one is down. So, it's a triplet state in the sense that it's symmetric under exchange of any two particles, but with two up and one down. 

Wait, actually, let's think about the permutation symmetry. If I swap particles 1 and 2, the term up1 up2 down3 becomes up2 up1 down3, which is the same as the original. Similarly, up1 down2 up3 swaps to up2 down1 up3, which is another term in the superposition. Similarly, down1 up2 up3 swaps to up1 down2 up3. So the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. 

So, perhaps this state is part of a multiplet with definite permutation symmetry. But since the Hamiltonian is symmetric in all three particles, it's likely that the state is an eigenstate of H. Wait, but the answer says it's not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the state is a singlet or a triplet state when considering the three spins. But with three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can range from 0 to 3/2 in integer steps. However, our state has two up and one down, which isn't the singlet state (which would have total spin 0). But perhaps it's part of a larger multiplet.

Wait, let's think about the action of H on psi. Since H is a sum of S_i·S_j terms, and each S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin of the pair. Let me try to compute S_i·S_j for each pair.

First, let's note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2). Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (3/4)ħ². So, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²) = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - 3/2 ħ²).

Now, the total spin S_{i,j} can be either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So, S_{i,j}^2 is ħ² s(s+1), where s=0 or 1. Therefore, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(ħ² s(s+1) - 3/2 ħ²) = (ħ²/2)(s(s+1) - 3/2).

Thus, if the pair (i,j) is in a singlet state (s=0), S_i·S_j = (ħ²/2)(0 - 3/2) = -3ħ²/4. If it's in a triplet state (s=1), S_i·S_j = (ħ²/2)(2 - 3/2) = (ħ²/2)(1/2) = ħ²/4.

So, to compute H, we need to find the expectation value of each S_i·S_j term in the state psi and then sum them up weighted by A.

So, let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, <psi| S1·S3 |psi>, and <psi| S2·S3 |psi>.

First, let's compute <S1·S2>. The state psi is symmetric, so maybe the expectation value will be the same for each pair? Let's check.

The state psi is |psi> = 1/sqrt(3) [ |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ].

Let me compute <S1·S2> for this state.

Note that S1·S2 = S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

So, let's compute each component.

First, S1^z S2^z: For each term in |psi>, we can compute S1^z S2^z.

In |up up down>, S1^z = ħ/2, S2^z = ħ/2, so their product is (ħ²/4).

Similarly, in |up down up>, S1^z = ħ/2, S2^z = -ħ/2, so product is -(ħ²/4).

In |down up up>, S1^z = -ħ/2, S2^z = ħ/2, so product is -(ħ²/4).

Thus, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z in |psi> is:

(1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ] = (1/3)(-ħ²/4) = -ħ²/(12).

Next, S1^x S2^x: Let's remember that S^x |up> = ħ/2 |down>, and S^x |down> = ħ/2 |up>. Similarly for S^y, but we'll have to be careful with the factors.

So, let's compute S1^x S2^x |psi>:

First, apply S1^x to each term:

S1^x |up1 up2 down3> = (ħ/2) |down1 up2 down3>

Similarly, S1^x |up1 down2 up3> = (ħ/2) |down1 down2 up3>

And S1^x |down1 up2 up3> = (ħ/2) |up1 up2 up3>

Then, apply S2^x to each of those:

S2^x |down1 up2 down3> = (ħ/2) |down1 down2 down3>

S2^x |down1 down2 up3> = (ħ/2) |down1 up2 up3>

S2^x |up1 up2 up3> = (ħ/2) |up1 down2 up3>

So, putting it all together, S1^x S2^x |psi> is (ħ²/4) * (1/sqrt(3)) [ |down1 down2 down3> + |down1 up2 up3> + |up1 down2 up3> ].

Now, to compute <psi | S1^x S2^x |psi>, we take the inner product of |psi> with this result.

|psi> is (1/sqrt(3)) [ |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ].

So, the inner product is (1/3) [ <up up down | down down down> + <up up down | down up up> + <up up down | up down up> + similar terms from the other components ].

But let's compute each part:

The first term: <up up down | down down down> is zero.

Second term: <up up down | down up up> is zero.

Third term: <up up down | up down up> is zero.

Similarly, the other terms:

From the second component of S1^x S2^x |psi>, which is |down1 up2 up3>, inner product with |up up down> is zero, with |up down up> gives <up down up | down up up> which is zero (since the first spin is up vs down), and with |down up up> gives <down up up | down up up> which is 1.

Similarly, the third component: |up1 down2 up3> inner product with |psi> gives <up up down | up down up> which is zero, <up down up | up down up> which is 1, and <down up up | up down up> which is zero.

So, putting it all together, the inner product is (1/3) [ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 ] = (1/3)(2) = 2/3. But wait, each term is weighted by (ħ²/4) * (1/sqrt(3)), so actually, the inner product is (ħ²/4) * (1/3) * 2 = (ħ²/6).

Wait, no, let me correct that. The state S1^x S2^x |psi> is (ħ²/4) * (1/sqrt(3)) [ |down down down> + |down up up> + |up down up> ].

So, when we take <psi | S1^x S2^x |psi>, it's (1/sqrt(3)) [ <up up down| + <up down up| + <down up up| ] multiplied by (ħ²/4) (1/sqrt(3)) [ |down down down> + |down up up> + |up down up> ].

So, the inner product is (ħ²/4) * (1/3) [ <up up down | down down down> + <up up down | down up up> + <up up down | up down up> + <up down up | down down down> + <up down up | down up up> + <up down up | up down up> + <down up up | down down down> + <down up up | down up up> + <down up up | up down up> ].

Calculating each term:

1. <up up down | down down down> = 0
2. <up up down | down up up> = 0
3. <up up down | up down up> = 0
4. <up down up | down down down> = 0
5. <up down up | down up up> = 0
6. <up down up | up down up> = 1
7. <down up up | down down down> = 0
8. <down up up | down up up> = 1
9. <down up up | up down up> = 0

So, only terms 6 and 8 contribute, each giving 1. Therefore, the inner product is (ħ²/4)*(1/3)*(2) = (ħ²/6).

Similarly, the same computation applies to S1^y S2^y. Because the state is symmetric under permutations and the structure of S^y is similar to S^x (though with some phase factors, but since we're taking the expectation value, the phases might cancel out). Therefore, <S1^y S2^y> = <S1^x S2^x> = ħ²/6.

Therefore, the total expectation value of S1·S2 is <S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z> = (ħ²/6) + (ħ²/6) + (-ħ²/12) = (2ħ²/12 + 2ħ²/12 - ħ²/12) = (3ħ²/12) = ħ²/4.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the signs again. From earlier, <S1^z S2^z> was -ħ²/12. Then, <S1^x S2^x> and <S1^y S2^y> were both ħ²/6 each. So, total is (1/6 + 1/6 - 1/12) ħ² = (2/12 + 2/12 - 1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4. So, yes, ħ²/4.

Similarly, because the state is symmetric, the same result should hold for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>. Therefore, each expectation value is ħ²/4.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ) = A*(3*(ħ²/4)) = (3A/4) ħ². Wait, but the answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ². Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check. Maybe the assumption that all three expectation values are the same is incorrect. Because in the state psi, the number of up and down spins is fixed, but the way the spins are paired might affect the expectation value.

Wait, let's reconsider. In the state psi, we have two up spins and one down. So, for each pair, sometimes both are up, sometimes one is up and one is down.

Wait, perhaps the expectation value for S_i·S_j is different for different pairs. For example, consider S1·S2: in the state psi, the possible combinations for spins 1 and 2 are both up, or one up and one down. How many terms have both up? Let's see: in psi, the terms are up1 up2 down3, up1 down2 up3, down1 up2 up3. So, for S1·S2, in the first term, both are up, in the second term, one up and one down, in the third term, one up and one down.

So, for S1·S2, the expectation value would be:

In the first term: |up up>, so S1^z S2^z = (ħ/2)^2 = ħ²/4.

In the second term: |up down>, so S1^z S2^z = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

Similarly for the third term: |down up>, same as above.

Therefore, the average of S1^z S2^z over psi is:

(1/3) [ ħ²/4 + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ] = (1/3)(-ħ²/4) = -ħ²/12.

Similarly, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y would be the same as before? Or maybe different.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value of S1·S2 more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the state psi has two up spins and one down, and in each pair, sometimes they are both up, sometimes one is up and one down. The total expectation value would then be a weighted average.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that S_i·S_j can be expressed as (1/4)(1 + (S_i^z + S_j^z) + ...). Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be determined based on whether they are in a singlet or triplet state.

But in our case, the state psi is a combination of three product states, each with two ups and one down. So, the pairs can either be both up or one up and one down.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the state as a combination of all possible two-up one-down states and compute the expectation value accordingly.

Wait, let's consider each term in psi.

First term: |up up down>. In this term, S1 and S2 are both up, so S1·S2 = (3/4 ħ²) for each component squared, so S1·S2 = (3/4 ħ²) - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²)/2 ?

Wait, no, let's get back. Earlier, we had S_i·S_j = (S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2.

So, for the pair (1,2), in the first term |up up down>, S1 and S2 are both up, so their total spin S_{1,2} is S=1 (triplet). Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = 2ħ². So, S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)ħ²/2 = 0.5ħ²/2 = ħ²/4.

Similarly, in the second term |up down up>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so their total spin S_{1,2} is S=0 (singlet). Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = 0. So, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (-1.5 ħ²)/2 = -3ħ²/4.

Same for the third term |down up up>, S_{1,2} is singlet, so S1·S2 = -3ħ²/4.

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in |psi> is:

(1/3) [ (1/4 ħ²) + (-3/4 ħ²) + (-3/4 ħ²) ] = (1/3)(1/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ħ² = (1/3)(-5/4 ħ²) = -5ħ²/12.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier result. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the pair's spin with the total spin. Let me think again.

If two spins are both up, their total spin is S=1. Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = 2ħ². So, S1·S2 = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)ħ²/2 = 0.5ħ²/2 = ħ²/4.

If two spins are one up and one down, their total spin is S=0, so S_{1,2}^2 = 0. Therefore, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)ħ² / 2 = (-1.5ħ²)/2 = -3ħ²/4.

Therefore, in the state psi, which is a combination of three terms, two of which have S1·S2 = -3ħ²/4 and one has S1·S2 = ħ²/4. Therefore, the expectation value is:

(1/3)( ħ²/4 + (-3ħ²/4) + (-3ħ²/4) ) = (1/3)( -5ħ²/4 ) = -5ħ²/12.

Similarly, for S1·S3 and S2·S3, let's see:

In the state psi, for S1·S3:

First term: |up up down>, so S1 and S3 are up and down, which is S=0, so S1·S3 = -3ħ²/4.

Second term: |up down up>, S1 and S3 are up and up, so S_{1,3} = 1, so S1·S3 = ħ²/4.

Third term: |down up up>, S1 and S3 are down and up, so S=0, S1·S3 = -3ħ²/4.

Therefore, the expectation value is:

(1/3)( -3ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 + (-3ħ²/4) ) = (1/3)( -5ħ²/4 ) = -5ħ²/12.

Similarly, for S2·S3:

First term: |up up down>, S2 and S3 are up and down, S=0, so S2·S3 = -3ħ²/4.

Second term: |up down up>, S2 and S3 are down and up, S=0, so S2·S3 = -3ħ²/4.

Third term: |down up up>, S2 and S3 are up and up, S=1, so S2·S3 = ħ²/4.

Therefore, expectation value:

(1/3)( -3ħ²/4 + (-3ħ²/4) + ħ²/4 ) = (1/3)( -5ħ²/4 ) = -5ħ²/12.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion where I thought all three expectation values were ħ²/4. Clearly, this approach gives a different result. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the state psi, the pairs are sometimes in triplet and sometimes in singlet, so the expectation value is a combination.

But in the first approach, I computed <S1·S2> as -5ħ²/12, but in the second approach, I was getting ħ²/4. These are conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the first approach, I considered the action of S^x and S^y operators, but in the second approach, I considered the total spin.

Let me clarify.

The correct expectation value is given by the second approach because it directly uses the relation S_i·S_j = (S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2, which is exact. Therefore, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is ( <S_{i,j}^2> - <S_i^2> - <S_j^2> ) / 2.

Since S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ² for each particle, the expectation value becomes:

( <S_{i,j}^2> - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) / 2 = ( <S_{i,j}^2> - 3/2 ħ² ) / 2.

Now, in the state psi, for each pair (i,j), the probability that the pair is in a triplet state (S=1) is the number of terms where both spins are up or both are down, divided by the total number of terms.

Wait, in psi, each term has exactly two up and one down. So, for each pair, the number of terms where both are up is only one (the first term). The number of terms where both are down is zero, since each term has exactly one down spin. Therefore, the number of terms where the pair is in a triplet state is one, and the rest are in singlet states.

Therefore, for each pair (i,j), <S_{i,j}^2> = (1 term)*(2ħ²) + (2 terms)*(0) ) / 3 = 2ħ²/3.

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (2ħ²/3 - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = (2/3 - 3/2)ħ² / 2.

Wait, let's compute that:

(2/3 - 3/2) = (4/6 - 9/6) = (-5/6). Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (-5/6 ħ²)/2 = (-5/12) ħ².

So, indeed, each <S_i·S_j> = -5ħ²/12.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when both spins are up, S_{i,j}^2 = 2ħ², and when they are mixed, S_{i,j}^2 = 0. But in this case, the expectation value <S_{i,j}^2> is only 2ħ²/3, because only one out of three terms is in a triplet state.

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (-5/12)ħ² for each pair.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is A*( (-5/12)ħ² + (-5/12)ħ² + (-5/12)ħ² ) = A*(-15/12 ħ²) = A*(-5/4 ħ²). But this contradicts the earlier result and also the supposed answer.

Wait, hold on. There's a miscalculation here. The state psi is |psi> = 1/sqrt(3) [ |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ].

For each pair, (i,j):

- For S1·S2: in |up up down>, both up: triplet (S=1), so S_{1,2}^2 = 2ħ².

In |up down up> and |down up up>, the pair S1·S2 is one up and one down: singlet (S=0), so S_{1,2}^2 = 0.

Therefore, the average <S1·S2> is (1 term)*2ħ² + (2 terms)*0 ) /3 = 2ħ²/3.

Then, <S_i·S_j> = ( <S_{i,j}^2> - 3/2 ħ² ) / 2 = (2ħ²/3 - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = ( (4/6 - 9/6) ħ² ) /2 = (-5/6 ħ²)/2 = -5ħ²/12.

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so <H> = A*(3*(-5ħ²/12)) = A*(-15ħ²/12) = A*(-5ħ²/4). But this contradicts the supposed answer of 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, clearly, I must be making a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption about <S_i·S_j>. Let me compute it directly.

Compute <S1·S2> as <S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z>.

From earlier, we computed <S1^z S2^z> = -ħ²/12.

Now, let's compute <S1^x S2^x>. Let's note that S^x |up> = ħ/2 |down>, and S^x |down> = ħ/2 |up>.

So, S1^x S2^x |psi> = S1^x S2^x (1/sqrt(3))( |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> ).

Compute each term:

1. S1^x |up> = ħ/2 |down>, so S1^x |up up down> = ħ/2 |down up down>

Then, S2^x |down up down> = (ħ/2) |down down down>

2. S1^x |up down up> = ħ/2 |down down up>

Then, S2^x |down down up> = (ħ/2) |down up up>

3. S1^x |down up up> = (ħ/2) |up up up>

Then, S2^x |up up up> = (ħ/2) |up down up>

Therefore, S1^x S2^x |psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) [ (ħ²/4) |down down down> + (ħ²/4) |down up up> + (ħ²/4) |up down up> ].

Now, compute <psi | S1^x S2^x |psi>:

Inner product of (1/sqrt(3))( <up up down| + <up down up| + <down up up| ) with (1/sqrt(3))( ħ²/4 |down down down> + ħ²/4 |down up up> + ħ²/4 |up down up> ).

So, the inner product is (1/3)( ħ²/4 ) [ <up up down | down down down> + <up up down | down up up> + <up up down | up down up> + <up down up | down down down> + <up down up | down up up> + <up down up | up down up> + <down up up | down down down> + <down up up | down up up> + <down up up | up down up> ].

As before, only the terms where the states match will contribute. From the above, the only non-zero contributions are:

- <down up up | down up up> = 1, coefficient ħ²/4
- <up down up | up down up> = 1, coefficient ħ²/4

So, total inner product is (1/3)( ħ²/4 )(2) = (2 ħ²)/12 = ħ²/6.

Similarly, <S1^y S2^y> would be the same as <S1^x S2^x> because the state is symmetric and the y-components will yield the same result upon expectation. Therefore, <S1^y S2^y> = ħ²/6.

Adding them up:

<S1·S2> = <S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z> = ħ²/6 + ħ²/6 - ħ²/12 = (2ħ²/12 + 2ħ²/12 - ħ²/12) = 3ħ²/12 = ħ²/4.

Wait, this contradicts the earlier result of -5ħ²/12. Which one is correct?

Wait, I think the confusion arises because in one approach I'm considering the expectation value of S_i·S_j in the triplet vs singlet states, but when computing directly via operators, I get a different result. So, I must reconcile these.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by not considering that when two spins are in a triplet state, their S_i·S_j is ħ²/4, but when in a singlet, it's -3ħ²/4. However, in the state psi, each pair is sometimes in triplet and sometimes in singlet.

Specifically, for each pair (i,j), in one of the three terms they are in triplet (both up or both down), and in the other two terms, they are in singlet.

But in our state psi, for each pair, they are both up in exactly one term (e.g., for S1 and S2, only in the first term are both up). The other two terms have one up and one down. Therefore, the expectation value for S_i·S_j is:

(1/3)( ħ²/4 ) + (2/3)( -3ħ²/4 ) = (1/3 - 6/3)(ħ²/4) = (-5/3)(ħ²/4) = -5ħ²/12.

But this contradicts the operator approach which gave ħ²/4.

This inconsistency suggests that I'm making a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me think carefully.

The key is to realize that in the state psi, when considering S_i·S_j, the expectation value is not simply a weighted average of the triplet and singlet contributions because the state is a superposition of different product states, and the operators don't necessarily diagonalize the same basis.

Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the expectation value directly using the operator method, as done earlier, which gave <S1·S2> = ħ²/4.

But wait, in the operator approach, I found that <S1·S2> = ħ²/4. However, when considering the triplet and singlet contributions, I found -5ħ²/12. These two results must be consistent, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value numerically for each S_i·S_j.

Let me consider S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2).

We know S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ² for each i.

So, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <S_{i,j}^2> - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) = (1/2)( <S_{i,j}^2> - 3/2 ħ² ).

Now, in the state psi, for each pair (i,j), how much is <S_{i,j}^2>?

We can compute <S_{i,j}^2> as the expectation value of the total spin squared for the pair (i,j). For two spin-1/2 particles, S_{i,j}^2 can be 0 (singlet) or 2ħ² (triplet).

In our state psi, each pair (i,j) is in a triplet state in exactly one of the three terms, and in a singlet state in the other two. Therefore, <S_{i,j}^2> = (1 term * 2ħ² + 2 terms * 0 ) /3 = 2ħ²/3.

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( 2ħ²/3 - 3/2 ħ² ) = (1/2)( (4/6 - 9/6) ħ² ) = (1/2)( -5/6 ħ² ) = -5ħ²/12.

Wait, but according to the operator approach, I found <S1·S2> = ħ²/4. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the error is in assuming that <S_{i,j}^2> = 2ħ²/3 for each pair. But in reality, the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_{i,j}^2 for each pair; it's a superposition of states where each pair is sometimes in a triplet and sometimes not.

But when we compute <S_i·S_j>, it's the expectation value over the entire state, which includes all possible terms. Therefore, I think the operator approach is correct, giving <S1·S2> = ħ²/4.

Wait, but according to the operator computation, <S1·S2> = ħ²/4
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out if a given spin state is an eigenfunction of a particular Hamiltonian. If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, I need to calculate the expectation value. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. We have three spin-1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as (1/sqrt(3))*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). So, psi is a superposition of three basis states where in each term, two spins are up and one is down.

The question is whether this state is an eigenstate of H. If it is, what's the energy? If not, what's the expectation value of H?

From what I recall, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian have definite energies, meaning when H acts on them, they just get multiplied by a scalar (the eigenvalue). If psi is not an eigenstate, then H acting on psi would give a combination of states, and the expectation value would be the average energy.

I think the strategy here is to compute the expectation value of H in the state psi, which involves calculating the expectation values of each term S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3, then summing them up and multiplying by A. If the result is the same as when H acts on psi, then it's an eigenstate; otherwise, it's not.

Let me write down the state more clearly: psi = (1/sqrt(3)) (|↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>). Each term has two up spins and one down spin, each in different positions.

Now, H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, I can compute the expectation value as <psi| H |psi> = A (<psi| S1·S2 |psi> + <psi| S1·S3 |psi> + <psi| S2·S3 |psi>).

Since each term in H is symmetric, maybe each expectation value is the same? Let me check.

First, let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the dot product S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) ) + S_i^z S_j^z. Alternatively, I remember that S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. That might be helpful because it relates the pair spin interaction to the total spin.

So, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2. Similarly for the other terms.

Given that, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2 by considering the total spin squared.

In the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down, so let's think about the total spin. Each term is a state with two spins up and one down. The total spin S_total is the sum of the individual spins.

But wait, the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles. So, maybe it's an eigenstate of the total spin. Let's think about that.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down. So, for each term, the spin configuration is such that two are up and one is down. Therefore, when considering the total spin, these are states with two spins aligned and one opposite.

But wait, the total spin S_total^2 would depend on how the spins are combined. For two spins, the maximum is S=1 (triplet) and S=0 (singlet), but with three spins, the total spin can be S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 (which can hold 4 states) and S=1/2 (which holds 2 states). But our state psi has three terms, each with two up and one down. Let's count the number of such terms: for three particles, there are C(3,1)=3 terms where one is down and two are up. So, our state is a symmetric combination of these three.

Now, is this state an eigenstate of S_total^2? Let me think.

The state with all three spins up, |↑↑↑>, is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with S=3/2. Our state is a combination of states with two up and one down. Maybe these states have lower total spin.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for the state psi, then use that to find the expectation value of each S_i·S_j.

Wait, let's see. Since H is a sum of S_i·S_j, and each S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of S_total^2, perhaps it's possible to express the expectation value of H in terms of the expectation value of S_total^2.

Let me write that out.

H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ) ]

Wait, that seems a bit convoluted. Let me try to sum them up.

Each S_i·S_j term is (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So, when we sum over all three pairs:

Sum = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Let me compute this:

Each term has S_total^2/2, then subtract (S1^2 + S2^2)/2, etc.

So, adding all three:

= 3*(S_total^2)/2 - [ (S1^2 + S2^2) + (S1^2 + S3^2) + (S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2

Simplify the subtraction part:

= 3 S_total^2 / 2 - [ 2 S1^2 + 2 S2^2 + 2 S3^2 ] / 2

Which is:

= (3/2) S_total^2 - (2/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )

Simplify further:

= (3/2) S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )

But each S_i is spin-1/2, so S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4) ħ^2 = (9/4) ħ^2.

Substituting back:

Sum = (3/2) S_total^2 - (9/4) ħ^2.

Therefore, H = A * [ (3/2) S_total^2 - (9/4) ħ^2 ].

So, if we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in psi, then we can find the expectation value of H.

So, let me compute <psi | S_total^2 | psi>.

But wait, S_total^2 is the square of the total spin operator. The eigenvalues are S(S+1) ħ^2, where S can be 3/2 or 1/2 for three spin-1/2 particles.

But our state psi is a combination of states with two up and one down. Let's see if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute <psi | S_total^2 | psi> directly.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation values of each S_i·S_j separately and then sum them up.

Wait, but given that H can be written in terms of S_total^2, perhaps it's more efficient to compute <S_total^2> first.

But let's see. Let me consider the state psi.

Since each term in psi is a product state with two up and one down, let's think about the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each S_i·S_j term separately.

Wait, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

But in the state psi, which is a combination of |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, |↓↑↑>, so let's compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each pair.

Let's compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>, <psi | S1·S3 | psi>, and <psi | S2·S3 | psi>, then sum them.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

First, let's note that S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) + S1^z S2^z.

But maybe it's easier to compute in terms of expectation values.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, when they are in a state |↑↑>, <S1·S2> = ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, no, that's S1·S2 = (3/4) ħ^2 for the triplet state.

Wait, actually, for two spins, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

In the state |↑↑>, S_total = 1, so (S_total)^2 = 2 ħ^2. So, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25 ħ^2.

Wait, that can't be right because for |↑↑>, S1·S2 should be 3/4 ħ^2, but according to that, it's 1/4 ħ^2. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, no, for two spins, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

In triplet states, S_total = 1, so S_total^2 = 2ħ^2.

Thus, S1·S2 = (2ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2)/2 = (2 - 1.5) ħ^2 / 2 = 0.5 ħ^2 /2 = 0.25 ħ^2. But wait, that contradicts my previous thought.

But actually, in the state |↑↑>, S1·S2 = ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2, right? Because each spin is up, so their dot product is maximum.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

The expectation value of S_i·S_j in a state |s1, s2> is given by <s1, s2| S_i·S_j |s1, s2>.

Which can be written as ( <s1| S_i^x |s1> <s2| S_j^x |s2> + same for y and z ) / ħ^2.

Wait, no, actually, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) ) + S_i^z S_j^z.

So, in the state |↑↑>, S_i^z |↑> = (1/2) ħ |↑>, and S_i^+ |↑> = 0, S_i^- |↑> = (1/2) ħ |↓>.

So, let's compute <↑↑| S1·S2 |↑↑>:

= (1/2) [ <↑| S1^+ |↑> <↑| S2^- |↑> + <↑| S1^- |↑> <↑| S2^+ |↑> ] + <↑| S1^z |↑> <↑| S2^z |↑>

= (1/2) [ 0*0 + 0*0 ] + ( (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) ) + ( (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) )

Wait, no, wait, let's compute each term.

First term: (1/2) [ S1^+ S2^- ] evaluated in |↑↑>:

S1^+ |↑> = 0, so <↑| S1^+ |↑> = 0.

Similarly, <↑| S2^- |↑> = <↑| (1/2 ħ) |↓> = 0.

So, first term is 0.

Second term: (1/2) [ S1^- S2^+ ] evaluated in |↑↑>:

S1^- |↑> = (1/2 ħ) |↓>, so <↑| S1^- |↑> = (1/2 ħ) <↑|↓> = 0.

Similarly, <↑| S2^+ |↑> = 0.

So, the (1/2) [ ... ] term is 0.

Third term: S1^z S2^z |↑↑> = ( (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) ) |↑↑> = (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↑>.

So, the expectation value is (1/4 ħ^2).

Wait, so in |↑↑>, <S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2.

But earlier, I thought it was 3/4 ħ^2, which must be wrong.

Wait, no, actually, in the triplet state |↑↑>, the total spin S_total = 1, so S_total^2 = 2 ħ^2.

Then, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 = (2 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2)/2 = (2 - 1.5) ħ^2 /2 = 0.5 ħ^2 /2 = 0.25 ħ^2, which matches the direct computation.

So, in |↑↑>, <S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, in |↑↓>, let's compute <S1·S2>.

In |↑↓>, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) /2.

In |↑↓>, the total spin S_total can be 0 or 1. Wait, but |↑↓> is a superposition of S=1 and S=0 states.

Wait, no, actually, the singlet state is |↑↓> - |↓↑> over sqrt(2), and the triplet states include |↑↑>, |↓↓>, and |↑↓> + |↓↑> over sqrt(2).

So, |↑↓> is part of the triplet state.

Wait, no, |↑↓> isn't an eigenstate of S_total^2. To compute <S1·S2> in |↑↓>, we can compute it directly.

So, S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Let's compute <↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓>.

First, S1^z |↑> = (1/2 ħ) |↑>, S2^z |↓> = (-1/2 ħ) |↓>.

So, <↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↓> = (1/2 ħ)(-1/2 ħ) = -1/4 ħ^2.

Next, S1^x |↑> = (1/2)( |↓> + |↑> ) ? Wait, no, S^x for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) [ |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ].

Wait, no, S^x = (ħ/2) ( |↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ).

So, S1^x |↑> = (ħ/2) |↓>, and S1^x |↓> = (ħ/2) |↑>.

Similarly for S^y: S^y = (ħ/2i)( |↑><↓| - |↓><↑| ).

So, S1^x |↑> = (ħ/2) |↓>, S1^x |↓> = (ħ/2) |↑>.

Similarly, S2^x |↑> = (ħ/2) |↓>, S2^x |↓> = (ħ/2) |↑>.

Similarly for S^y.

So, let's compute <↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↓>.

= <↑| S1^x |↑> <↓| S2^x |↓>

But wait, no, it's <↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↓> = <↑| S1^x |↑> <↓| S2^x |↓> + cross terms? Wait, no, actually, S1^x acts on the first particle, S2^x acts on the second.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↓> = S1^x |↑> ⊗ S2^x |↓> = (ħ/2 |↓>) ⊗ (ħ/2 |↑>) = (ħ^2 /4) |↓↑>.

Then, <↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↓> = <↑↓| (ħ^2 /4) |↓↑> = 0, because |↑↓> and |↓↑> are orthogonal.

Similarly, <↑↓| S1^y S2^y |↑↓> would be the same, because it would involve |↓↑> again.

So, the cross terms (x and y) give zero.

Only the z term contributes: -1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, <S1·S2> in |↑↓> is -1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, in the |↑↑> state, it's +1/4 ħ^2, in |↑↓>, it's -1/4 ħ^2.

Okay, so now, going back to our state psi, which is a combination of |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, and |↓↑↑>.

Each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin.

So, let's compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>.

First, note that psi is (1/sqrt(3)) (a + b + c), where a = |↑↑↓>, b = |↑↓↑>, c = |↓↑↑>.

So, <psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (1/3) [ <a| S1·S2 |a> + <a| S1·S2 |b> + <a| S1·S2 |c> + <b| S1·S2 |a> + <b| S1·S2 |b> + <b| S1·S2 |c> + <c| S1·S2 |a> + <c| S1·S2 |b> + <c| S1·S2 |c> ].

But due to the orthogonality of the basis states, many of these terms will be zero.

Specifically, when we have |a> and |b>, unless they are the same, their inner products with S1·S2 will be zero.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 acts on the first two particles, so let's analyze each term:

Compute <a| S1·S2 |a>: This is <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓>.

Here, the first two spins are both up, so S1·S2 acting on |↑↑> is 1/4 ħ^2, as computed earlier. So, this term is (1/4 ħ^2) * <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, <b| S1·S2 |b> = <↑↓↑| S1·S2 |↑↓↑>.

Here, the first two spins are |↑↓>, so S1·S2 acting on that gives -1/4 ħ^2. So, this term is (-1/4 ħ^2).

Similarly, <c| S1·S2 |c> = <↓↑↑| S1·S2 |↓↑↑>.

Here, the first two spins are |↓↑>, so S1·S2 acting on that is -1/4 ħ^2.

So, these diagonal terms contribute (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ^2? Wait, no, each is multiplied by 1, but in our case, we have to sum over all three diagonal terms. Wait, no, each term is 1/3 times (each term is 1/3 multiplied by all nine terms). Wait, maybe I should structure it better.

Wait, actually, <a| S1·S2 |a> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, <b| S1·S2 |b> = -1/4 ħ^2, and <c| S1·S2 |c> = -1/4 ħ^2.

So, the diagonal terms contribute (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ^2, but multiplied by 1/3.

Wait, no, no. Let's see: the entire expression is 1/3 times the sum over all nine terms.

So, let's compute each non-zero term:

First, <a| S1·S2 |a> = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, <b| S1·S2 |b> = -1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, <c| S1·S2 |c> = -1/4 ħ^2.

Now, what about the cross terms, like <a| S1·S2 |b>? That is, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑>.

But S1·S2 acts on the first two particles. So, in |a> = |↑↑↓>, and |b> = |↑↓↑>, the first two spins in |a> are |↑↑>, and in |b> are |↑↓>.

So, S1·S2 |b> = S1·S2 |↑↓> ⊗ |↑>.

From earlier, we know that S1·S2 |↑↓> = (-1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓>.

Wait, no, S1·S2 is an operator, not a scalar. So, S1·S2 |↑↓> = (-1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓>.

Wait, no, that's the expectation value. The operator acting on |↑↓> would give (-1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓>.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The operator S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) + S1^z S2^z.

So, when acting on |↑↓>, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↓>.

= (1/2)( S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+ ) |↑↓> + S1^z S2^z |↑↓>

Compute each term:

First term: (1/2) S1^+ S2^- |↑↓> = (1/2) S1^+ |↑> ⊗ S2^- |↓> = (1/2)(0) ⊗ ( -1/2 ħ |↓> ) = 0.

Second term: (1/2) S1^- S2^+ |↑↓> = (1/2)( S1^- |↑> ) ⊗ ( S2^+ |↓> ) = (1/2)( (1/2 ħ |↓> ) ) ⊗ ( (1/2 ħ |↑> ) ) = (1/2)(1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |↓↑> = (1/8 ħ^2) |↓↑>.

Third term: S1^z S2^z |↑↓> = ( (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) ) |↑↓> = (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓>.

So, altogether, S1·S2 |↑↓> = (1/8 ħ^2) |↓↑> + (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓>.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |b> = <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = <↑↑↓| [ (1/8 ħ^2) |↓↑> + (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↓> ].

But |↑↑↓> is orthogonal to both |↓↑> and |↑↓>, so this inner product is zero.

Similarly, all cross terms between a, b, c will be zero because the states are orthogonal.

Therefore, the only non-zero terms are the diagonal terms:

<psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (1/3)[ <a|S1·S2|a> + <b|S1·S2|b> + <c|S1·S2|c> ]

= (1/3)[ (1/4 ħ^2) + (-1/4 ħ^2) + (-1/4 ħ^2) ]

= (1/3)[ (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ^2 ]

= (1/3)( -1/4 ħ^2 ) = -1/12 ħ^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the expectation value of S1·S2 is -1/12 ħ^2.

Similarly, by symmetry, the expectation values of S1·S3 and S2·S3 will be the same.

So, <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = -1/12 ħ^2.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is:

<A ( -1/12 ħ^2 -1/12 ħ^2 -1/12 ħ^2 )> = A ( -3/12 ħ^2 ) = A ( -1/4 ħ^2 ).

Wait, but that contradicts the supposed answer of 2/3 A ħ^2. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation.

First, in the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down. So, when computing <S1·S2>, we have three terms in psi: a, b, c.

When computing <a| S1·S2 |a>, as a is |↑↑↓>, the first two spins are up, so S1·S2 is 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, for <b| S1·S2 |b>, b is |↑↓↑>, so the first two spins are |↑↓>, so S1·S2 is -1/4 ħ^2.

Same for <c| S1·S2 |c>, which is |↓↑↑>, so the first two spins are |↓↑>, which also gives -1/4 ħ^2.

So, summing these gives (1 -1 -1)/4 ħ^2 = (-1)/4 ħ^2, then multiplied by 1/3, gives (-1/12) ħ^2.

Similarly, each S1·S3 and S2·S3 will have the same expectation value.

But wait, let's think about S1·S3. In the state a = |↑↑↓>, S1·S3 involves the first and third spins, which are |↑↓>.

Similarly, in state b = |↑↓↑>, S1·S3 involves |↑↑>.

In state c = |↓↑↑>, S1·S3 involves |↓↑>.

So, let's compute <psi | S1·S3 | psi>.

Similarly, it would be (1/3)[ <a|S1·S3|a> + <b|S1·S3|b> + <c|S1·S3|c> ].

Compute each term:

< a | S1·S3 | a >: a is |↑↑↓>, so spins 1 and 3 are |↑↓>. So, S1·S3 is -1/4 ħ^2.

< b | S1·S3 | b >: b is |↑↓↑>, so spins 1 and 3 are |↑↑>. So, S1·S3 is 1/4 ħ^2.

< c | S1·S3 | c >: c is |↓↑↑>, so spins 1 and 3 are |↓↑>. So, S1·S3 is -1/4 ħ^2.

So, sum is ( -1 +1 -1 ) /4 ħ^2 = (-1)/4 ħ^2, multiplied by 1/3 gives (-1/12) ħ^2.

Similarly, for S2·S3:

< a | S2·S3 | a >: a is |↑↑↓>, so spins 2 and 3 are |↑↓>. So, S2·S3 is -1/4 ħ^2.

< b | S2·S3 | b >: b is |↑↓↑>, so spins 2 and 3 are |↓↑>. So, S2·S3 is -1/4 ħ^2.

< c | S2·S3 | c >: c is |↓↑↑>, so spins 2 and 3 are |↑↑>. So, S2·S3 is 1/4 ħ^2.

So, sum is ( -1 -1 +1 ) /4 ħ^2 = (-1)/4 ħ^2, multiplied by 1/3 gives (-1/12) ħ^2.

Therefore, each S_i·S_j expectation is -1/12 ħ^2.

Therefore, H = A ( -1/12 -1/12 -1/12 ) ħ^2 = A (-3/12) ħ^2 = A (-1/4) ħ^2.

But the supposed answer is 2/3 A ħ^2. Hmm, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the expectation values. Let me check again.

Wait, let's think about S_i·S_j in the state |↑↑>.

Earlier, I computed <S1·S2> as 1/4 ħ^2. Similarly, in |↑↓>, it's -1/4 ħ^2.

But in the state |a> = |↑↑↓>, the spins 1 and 2 are |↑↑>, so their dot product is 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, in |b> = |↑↓↑>, spins 1 and 2 are |↑↓>, so their dot product is -1/4 ħ^2.

In |c> = |↓↑↑>, spins 1 and 2 are |↓↑>, so their dot product is -1/4 ħ^2.

Therefore, the diagonal terms sum to (1 -1 -1)/4 ħ^2 = (-1)/4 ħ^2, and then 1/3 of that is (-1)/12 ħ^2.

Same for the other terms.

But wait, the supposed answer is positive 2/3 A ħ^2. So, I must have made a sign error.

Wait, let's think about the definition of S_i·S_j. It is (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But in our earlier calculation, in the state |↑↑>, S_i·S_j = 1/4 ħ^2, correct.

In |↑↓>, it's -1/4 ħ^2. So, seems correct.

But maybe the overall expectation is positive because the state has more of the triplet-like states.

Wait, no, in our case, each pair is |↑↑> once and |↑↓> twice.

But in the state psi, each term is equally weighted.

Wait, but each term in psi has two up spins and one down, so when considering pairs, each pair is either two up spins or one up and one down.

Wait, for each pair:

- In |↑↑↓>, the pairs are (↑,↑), (↑,↓), (↑,↓).

- In |↑↓↑>, the pairs are (↑,↓), (↓,↑), (↑,↑).

- In |↓↑↑>, the pairs are (↓,↑), (↑,↑), (↑,↓).

So, for each term, each pair is either two up spins or one up and one down.

But in psi, each of the three terms has one pair of two up spins and two pairs of mixed spins.

But since we have three terms, each contributing to each pair.

Wait, maybe another approach: instead of computing the expectation value of each S_i·S_j, let's compute the total expectation value of H directly.

Given that H = A (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), and each S_i·S_j has expectation value -1/12 ħ^2, so total expectation is A*(-1/4) ħ^2.

But that's negative, whereas the supposed answer is positive. So, I must have messed up the signs.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for S_i·S_j in |↑↑>.

Wait, in |↑↑>, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) /2.

S_total^2 for two spins in a triplet state is 2 ħ^2.

So, S1·S2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25 ħ^2. So, positive 1/4 ħ^2.

In |↑↓>, which is part of the singlet state, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -0.75/2 = -0.375 ħ^2? Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, for |↑↓>, which is part of the singlet state, S_total^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 = (-1.5)/2 = -0.75 ħ^2.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier, we computed it as -1/4 ħ^2 via direct operator application
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It involves three spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian H given by A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). I need to determine if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, I have to find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E. The answer is supposed to be that it's not an eigenstate with an expectation value of (2/3)*A*hbar². Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I recall that the dot product of spin operators S_i · S_j for two particles can be expressed as (1/2)(S_{i}^+ S_{j}^- + S_{i}^- S_{j}^+) + S_{i}^z S_{j}^z. But maybe it's easier to remember that S_i · S_j = (1/2)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j²]. Since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i² = (3/4)ħ² for each. So, S_i · S_j = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ² ] / 2 = [ (S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2)ħ² ] / 2. Hmm, that might be helpful for finding eigenvalues.

But in this case, we're dealing with the expectation value of the sum of these dot products. So H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, the expectation value <H> would be A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>). So, if I can compute each of these expectation values, I can sum them and multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

Given the state psi, let me write it again:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ]

So, in terms of the three spins, for each term in the superposition, two are up and one is down. It's symmetric in the sense that each term has two up spins and one down, but the down is in a different position each time.

I need to compute <S_i · S_j> for each pair (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).

Let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i · S_j in a state |s1 s2> can be computed as (1/4)(<S_i^+ S_j^-> + <S_i^- S_j^+>) + <S_i^z S_j^z>.

Alternatively, since S_i · S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ). So, S_i · S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ² ). So, the expectation value <S_i · S_j> would be (1/4)( <(S_i + S_j)^2> - 3/2 ħ² ).

But maybe it's more straightforward to compute each term separately. Let's try that.

First, for S1 · S2. Let me compute <psi | S1 · S2 | psi>.

Similarly for S1 · S3 and S2 · S3.

But since the state psi is symmetric with respect to the three particles, the expectation values <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3> should all be the same. Therefore, I can compute one of them and multiply by 3.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

To compute this, I need to compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>.

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

But it's often easier to work with spin matrices or use the eigenvalues for total spin. But since the state is a product state in terms of individual spins, maybe we can compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, but the given state is a symmetric combination of product states where two spins are up and one is down. Let's consider each term in the state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for two spins, the operator S1·S2 can be written in terms of their total spin. But in this case, since we have three spins, it's a bit more complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, since each term in psi is a product state, perhaps I can compute <S1·S2> for each term and then take the average.

Wait, but psi is a symmetric combination, so maybe it's an eigenstate of the total spin. Let me think about that.

Wait, the state psi has two up spins and one down spin. So, it's a state with total z-component S^z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So, S^z = 1/2 ħ.

But the total spin S^2 would give us information about whether it's an eigenstate of the total spin.

Wait, the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. So, it's a symmetric state. For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under exchange are the ones with total spin S=3/2 and S=1/2. Let me recall: for three spin-1/2, the symmetric representations are S=3/2 and S=1/2. The state psi is symmetric, so it must belong to either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But in this case, the state has S^z = 1/2 ħ, so in the S=3/2 multiplet, the possible S^z are 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. Similarly, for S=1/2, the possible S^z are 1/2, -1/2.

So, our state has S^z=1/2, so it could be part of either S=3/2 or S=1/2. To check, perhaps I can compute S^2 for this state.

Compute <S^2> = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1·S2 + 2 S1·S3 + 2 S2·S3>.

Since S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ² for each, the sum S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4) ħ² = (9/4) ħ².

Therefore, <S^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (9/4) ħ² + 2 <H>/A.

But I don't know <S^2> yet, because I don't know if the state is an eigenstate of S^2. Maybe I can compute <S^2> directly.

Wait, but the state is symmetric under exchange, so it must have a definite S^2. Therefore, it must be an eigenstate of S^2. Therefore, <S^2> must be either (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ² = (15/4) ħ² for S=3/2, or (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ² for S=1/2.

So, let's compute <S^2> for the state psi.

Alternatively, since S^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so let's compute the expectation value of each term.

But maybe it's easier to use the fact that in a state with two up and one down, the expectation value of S^2 can be determined by constructing the possible states.

But perhaps that's complicated. Alternatively, let me consider that the state psi is a symmetric state, so it's an eigenstate of S^2. Therefore, we can compute its eigenvalue.

But maybe another approach: let's compute <S1·S2> as follows.

Compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Expressed in terms of the basis states, since psi is a combination of three basis states.

Let me denote the basis states as |up1 up2 down3> = |1>, |up1 down2 up3> = |2>, and |down1 up2 up3> = |3>. So, psi = (|1> + |2> + |3>)/sqrt(3).

So, S1·S2 is an operator that acts on particles 1 and 2. Let's compute S1·S2 for each basis state.

First, note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Alternatively, since the state is a product state in terms of the three spins, maybe we can compute the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states have eigenvalues for S1·S2. The singlet state has S=0, so S1·S2 = (-3/4)ħ². The triplet states (S=1) have S1·S2 = (1/4)ħ².

Wait, but in our case, the state is in a three-spin system, so the two-particle state isn't necessarily a singlet or triplet. Hmm.

Wait, but for each pair, we can consider their S_i · S_j.

For example, in the state |up1 up2 down3>, the first two spins are up, so their total spin is S=1 (triplet state). Therefore, S1·S2 = (1/4)ħ².

Similarly, in the state |up1 down2 up3>, the first two spins are up and down, so their total spin can be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet).

Wait, actually, for two spins, if one is up and the other is down, their total spin can be S=0 or S=1. The eigenvalue of S1·S2 is (S(S+1) - 3/4 ħ²)/2.

Wait, more accurately, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

For two spins, S_total² = S(S+1) ħ², so S1·S2 = [ S(S+1) ħ² - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) ] / 2 = [ S(S+1) - 3/2 ] ħ² / 2.

Therefore, for S=1, S1·S2 = [ (2) - 3/2 ] ħ² / 2 = (1/2) ħ² / 2 = (1/4) ħ².

For S=0, S1·S2 = [ 0 - 3/2 ] ħ² / 2 = (-3/2) ħ² / 2 = (-3/4) ħ².

So, in the state |up1 up2 down3>, the first two spins are both up, so S=1, so S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ².

In the state |up1 down2 up3>, the first two spins are up and down. So their total spin can be S=0 or S=1. But in the state |up1 down2>, it's a superposition of S=0 and S=1 states.

Wait, but in the given state psi, each basis state is a product state. So when we compute <psi | S1·S2 | psi>, we can expand the inner product as follows:

<psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (1/3) [ <1| + <2| + <3| ] S1·S2 [ |1> + |2> + |3> ]

So, expanding this, we get (1/3) [ <1| S1·S2 |1> + <1| S1·S2 |2> + <1| S1·S2 |3> + <2| S1·S2 |1> + <2| S1·S2 |2> + <2| S1·S2 |3> + <3| S1·S2 |1> + <3| S1·S2 |2> + <3| S1·S2 |3> ]

Now, let's compute each term.

First, <1| S1·S2 |1>. In the state |1>, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ². So, this term is (1/4) ħ².

Similarly, <2| S1·S2 |2>. In state |2>, particles 1 is up, particle 2 is down, so S1·S2 is the same as in the two-spin state |up down>. The eigenvalue for S1·S2 in this case is... let's see, |up down> is a superposition of S=1 and S=0 states. So, the expectation value of S1·S2 in this state is [ (1/4) * probability(S=1) + (-3/4) * probability(S=0) ].

Wait, but |up down> is actually the state |+->. The state |+-> can be written as (|S=1, m=0> - |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2). Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 is [ (1/4) + (-3/4) ] / 2 = (-1/2)/2 = (-1/4) ħ². Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, if |+-> = (|S=1, m=0> - |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2), then <S1·S2> = [ <1| S1·S2 |1> + <0| S1·S2 |0> ] / 2 = [ (1/4) ħ² + (-3/4) ħ² ] / 2 = [ -1/2 ħ² ] / 2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Wait, that might be incorrect. Let me think again. The state |up down> is (|+->) which is (|S=1, m=0> - |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2). Therefore, the expectation value is [ (1/4) ħ² + (-3/4) ħ² ] multiplied by 1/2. So, [ (1/4 - 3/4 ) ħ² ] * 1/2 = (-1/2 ħ²) * 1/2 = (-1/4) ħ². Yes, that seems right.

Similarly, in state |3>, which is |down up up3>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up. Wait, no, in |3>, particle 1 is down, particles 2 and 3 are up. So, particles 1 and 2 are down and up, so similar to |up down>, so their S1·S2 expectation value is also (-1/4) ħ².

Wait, no, in state |3>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up. So, the state is |down up>. Which is the same as |+->, so same as state |2>. So, the expectation value is (-1/4) ħ².

Wait, but in |3>, it's |down1 up2 up3>, so for particles 1 and 2, it's |down up>, which is the same as |+->, so same as before.

Therefore, <2| S1·S2 |2> = (-1/4) ħ², and <3| S1·S2 |3> = (-1/4) ħ².

Now, what about the cross terms, like <1| S1·S2 |2>.

So, <1| S1·S2 |2> is the inner product of |up1 up2 down3> with S1·S2 acting on |up1 down2 up3>.

Let me write |1> = |up up down>, |2> = |up down up>, and |3> = |down up up>.

So, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2. So, in |1>, particles 1 and 2 are up and up, so S1·S2 |1> = (1/4) ħ² |1>.

In |2>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so S1·S2 |2> = (-1/4) ħ² |2>.

Similarly, in |3>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up, so S1·S2 |3> = (-1/4) ħ² |3>.

But what about <1| S1·S2 |2>? That is, the inner product of |up up down> with S1·S2 |up down up>.

Wait, S1·S2 is a scalar operator, so it doesn't change the state; it's just proportional to the expectation value. Wait, no, actually, S1·S2 is an operator, so when acting on |2>, it produces a state that might be orthogonal to |1>.

Wait, but in reality, S1·S2 is a scalar product, so it doesn't change the state in terms of the basis. So, it's more about the matrix elements. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent S1·S2 in the basis of the three states |1>, |2>, |3>.

But this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that in the given state psi, the terms are orthogonal. Let me check the inner product between |1> and |2>.

<1|2> = <up up down | up down up> = 0 because the third spin is different. Similarly, <1|3> = 0, and <2|3> = 0.

Therefore, the states |1>, |2>, |3> are orthogonal. So, when we compute the expectation value, the cross terms will vanish because <1|S1·S2|2> = 0, etc.

Wait, but that can't be right because S1·S2 is not diagonal in this basis. Wait, S1·S2 is an operator that mixes states.

Wait, no, actually, S1·S2 doesn't change the state in terms of particles 3 because it's only acting on particles 1 and 2. So, for example, S1·S2 |2> would be proportional to |2>, because particles 3 is up in both states.

Wait, no, actually, S1·S2 is a scalar product, so it doesn't change the state. Wait, but S1·S2 is an operator, so acting on |2> would give a multiple of |2>.

Wait, let's think. S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

In the state |2> = |up1 down2 up3>, S1^z |2> = (1/2) |2>, S2^z |2> = (-1/2) |2>.

Similarly, S1^+ |2> = sqrt( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) |up1 up2 up3> = sqrt(3/4) |up1 up2 up3>, but wait, actually, in |2>, particles 1 is up and 2 is down. So, S1^- |2> = 0, because S1^- acts on particle 1, which is already down.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that since the cross terms involve different states, and since S1·S2 doesn't change the state in terms of particle 3, but only affects particles 1 and 2.

In state |1>, particles 1 and 2 are up and up.

In state |2>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down.

In state |3>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up.

So, S1·S2 acting on |1> would give a multiple of |1>.

Similarly, acting on |2> gives a multiple of |2>, and acting on |3> gives a multiple of |3>.

Therefore, the operator S1·S2 is diagonal in this basis. Therefore, the cross terms like <1| S1·S2 |2> are zero because S1·S2 |2> is proportional to |2>, which is orthogonal to |1>.

Therefore, the expectation value <psi | S1·S2 | psi> is simply (1/3) [ <1| S1·S2 |1> + <2| S1·S2 |2> + <3| S1·S2 |3> ].

We already determined:

<1| S1·S2 |1> = (1/4) ħ²

<2| S1·S2 |2> = (-1/4) ħ²

<3| S1·S2 |3> = (-1/4) ħ²

Therefore, <psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (1/3)[ (1/4 + (-1/4) + (-1/4)) ħ² ] = (1/3)( (-1/4) ħ² ) = (-1/12) ħ².

Wait, that can't be correct because I think I made a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is (1/3)[ <1|S·S|1> + <2|S·S|2> + <3|S·S|3> ].

So, plugging in:

(1/3)[ (1/4) + (-1/4) + (-1/4) ] ħ² = (1/3)( -1/4 ) ħ² = (-1/12) ħ².

But that doesn't seem right because the expectation value should be the same for each pair, and the total expectation value would be 3*( -1/12 ) ħ² = -1/4 ħ², but the given answer is positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation.

In state |1>, which is |up up down>, the first two spins are up, so S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ².

In state |2>, which is |up down up>, the first two spins are up and down, so S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Similarly, in state |3>, which is |down up up>, the first two spins are down and up, so S1·S2 = (-1/4) ħ².

So, yes, the expectation values for each basis state are as above.

Therefore, the average is (1/3)[1/4 -1/4 -1/4] = (1/3)(-1/4) = -1/12 ħ².

Similarly, the same would be true for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>, because of symmetry. So, each of them would also be -1/12 ħ².

Therefore, the total expectation value <H> = A*( (-1/12) + (-1/12) + (-1/12) ) ħ² = A*(-1/4) ħ².

But wait, the given answer is (2/3) A ħ². So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check.

Wait, when I computed <S1·S2> for |2>, I thought it was (-1/4) ħ², but maybe I messed up the signs.

Wait, let's go back.

For two spins, S1·S2 = (1/4) ħ² for triplet (S=1), and (-3/4) ħ² for singlet (S=0). Wait, no, that was a mistake.

Wait, let's clarify. For two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (S_total² - S1² - S2²)/2.

So, S_total² = S(S+1) ħ², S1² = (3/4) ħ², S2² = (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 = [ S(S+1) - 3/4 - 3/4 ] ħ² / 2 = [ S(S+1) - 3/2 ] ħ² / 2.

For S=1: [2 - 3/2]/2 = [1/2]/2 = 1/4 ħ².

For S=0: [0 - 3/2]/2 = (-3/2)/2 = (-3/4) ħ².

So, for state |up up>, which is S=1, S1·S2 = 1/4 ħ².

For state |up down>, which is a combination of S=1 and S=0, but the expectation value is (1/4)(probability of S=1) + (-3/4)(probability of S=0). Since the state |up down> is an equal superposition of S=1 and S=0, the expectation value is (1/4 - 3/4)/2 = (-1/2)/2 = (-1/4) ħ².

Similarly for |down up>, same as |up down>.

Therefore, the previous calculation is correct.

So, the expectation value <S1·S2> is -1/12 ħ².

Similarly, <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> would be the same.

Therefore, <H> = A*( -1/12 -1/12 -1/12 ) ħ² = A*(-1/4) ħ².

But the given answer is positive (2/3) A ħ². Hmm, this suggests that I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization. The state psi is (1/sqrt(3))(...), so when computing <psi | S1·S2 | psi>, it's (1/3) times the sum of the diagonal elements.

But maybe I should also consider that in the state |2>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down, but in the context of the full three-spin state, perhaps the expectation value is different.

Wait, no, because when we compute <S1·S2>, we're only considering the first two particles, regardless of the third.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the cross terms vanish. Maybe they don't because S1·S2 might mix different states when considering all three particles.

Wait, but S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, so when acting on |2> (which is |up down up>), it would produce a state proportional to |up down up>, since the third particle is up. So, S1·S2 |2> is proportional to |2>, so the cross terms would be zero.

Wait, but that's only true if the operator doesn't change the state in the third particle. So, if the operator only affects particles 1 and 2, and leaves particle 3 untouched, then yes, S1·S2 |2> is proportional to |2>, so <1| S1·S2 |2> = 0 because |1> and |2> are orthogonal.

Therefore, cross terms should vanish, and the expectation value is indeed (1/3)(1/4 -1/4 -1/4) = -1/12 ħ².

So, the total expectation value is -1/4 ħ² * A.

But the given answer is positive (2/3) A ħ². So, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition of S_i · S_j. Let me check.

Wait, in the problem statement, the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, each term is S_i · S_j.

But in my calculation, I used the correct expression for S_i · S_j. However, maybe in the given answer, the expectation value is computed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of each pair without considering the cross terms, but I think that's already what I did.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expectation value using a different approach.

Let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles in a state with two up and one down, the expectation value of S_i · S_j can be computed as follows.

For each pair, the possible cases are:

- Both spins are up: then S_i · S_j = 1/4 ħ².

- One spin up, one down: then S_i · S_j = (-1/4) ħ².

So, for each pair, in the state psi, how often are both spins up or one up and one down.

Looking at psi, which is (|up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up>)/sqrt(3).

For pair (1,2):

In |up up down>, both 1 and 2 are up.

In |up down up>, 1 is up, 2 is down.

In |down up up>, 1 is down, 2 is up.

So, for pair (1,2):

- In 1/3 of the cases, both are up.

- In 2/3 of the cases, one is up and the other is down.

Similarly for pairs (1,3) and (2,3).

Therefore, the expectation value for each pair would be:

(1/3)(1/4) + (2/3)(-1/4) = [1/12 - 2/12] = (-1/12) ħ².

Which matches the previous calculation.

Therefore, the total expectation value is 3*(-1/12) = -1/4 ħ² * A.

But again, the given answer is positive (2/3) A ħ². So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the factor. Let me check the definition of the spin operators.

Wait, sometimes, spin operators are defined with a factor of ħ/2, so S_i^z |up> = (ħ/2) |up>, etc. So, S_i · S_j would be (ħ²/4) (S_i^x S_j^x + ...) in that case.

But in the given answer, it's (2/3) A ħ², which is positive, whereas my calculation gives negative. So, perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere.

Wait, going back to the expression for S_i · S_j.

Earlier, I wrote S_i · S_j = (1/4)( (S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ² ). But in terms of the eigenvalues, for S=1, S_i · S_j = 1/4 ħ², and for S=0, it's -3/4 ħ².

But when I computed the expectation value for the state |up down>, which is a superposition of S=1 and S=0, the expectation value was (-1/4) ħ², as computed earlier.

But wait, let me compute it again.

The state |up down> can be written as |+-> = (|S=1, m=0> + |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2). Wait, actually, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The state |up down> is actually (|S=1, m=0> + |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, let me recall:

The triplet states are:

|S=1, m=1> = |up up>

|S=1, m=0> = (|up down> + |down up>)/sqrt(2)

|S=1, m=-1> = |down down>

The singlet state is:

|S=0, m=0> = (|up down> - |down up>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, the state |up down> can be written as (|S=1, m=0> + |S=0, m=0>)/sqrt(2).

Therefore, the expectation value of S1·S2 in |up down> is [ <S=1| S1·S2 |S=1> + <S=0| S1·S2 |S=0> ] / 2.

Which is [ (1/4) + (-3/4) ] / 2 = (-1/2)/2 = (-1/4) ħ².

So, that was correct.

Therefore, the previous calculation is correct, and the expectation value is -1/12 ħ² per pair, total of -1/4 ħ² * A.

But the given answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, clearly, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the state psi is not normalized? No, it's given as (1/sqrt(3))(...), so it's normalized.

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines the spin operators without the 1/2 factor? Let me check.

Wait, in some conventions, S_i · S_j is defined as sum_i S_i^x S_j^x + ..., without the 1/2 factor. But in the standard convention, S_i · S_j = (1/2)(sum_i S_i^x S_j^x + ...). So, if the problem defines S_i · S_j without the 1/2 factor, then the expectation value would be different.

But the problem says H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, unless specified otherwise, we should assume the standard definition with the 1/2 factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the expectation value.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value again.

<psi | S1·S2 | psi> = (1/3)[ <1|S1·S2|1> + <2|S1·S2|2> + <3|S1·S2|3> ]

As before, this is (1/3)(1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ² = (-1/12) ħ².

But perhaps I should consider that each term in psi is multiplied by 1/sqrt(3), so when I compute <psi | ... | psi>, it's (1/3) times the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the given answer is using a different convention where S_i · S_j is defined as sum_i S_i^x S_j^x + ..., without the 1/2 factor. So, if that's the case, then the expectation value would be 2*(-1/12) = -1/6 ħ² per pair, totaling -1/2 ħ² * A. But that's still negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating the expectation value for the |up down> state.

Wait, no, because S1·S2 for |up down> is (-1/4) ħ², as per the triplet and singlet decomposition.

Alternatively, maybe the given answer is incorrect
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. If it is, find its energy; if not, find the expectation value. The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3) times (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). 

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin operators S_total^2. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. Since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be rewritten as A/2 * [S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ²] + similar terms for each pair. Wait, actually, H is the sum over all three pairs, so H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Using the expression above for each term, H = A/2 [ (S12^2 - 3/2 ħ²) + (S13^2 - 3/2 ħ²) + (S23^2 - 3/2 ħ²) ] where S12 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2, etc. Hmm, but actually, no, that approach might not be correct because each S_i·S_j is the dot product of individual spins, not the total spin. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, the total spin for all three particles would be S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, if I solve for the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3, it's equal to (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - ΣS_i^2)/2 ). Since each S_i^2 is 3/4 ħ², ΣS_i^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

So, H is proportional to S_total^2, which is the square of the total angular momentum. Therefore, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it will be an eigenstate of H, and we can find its energy. If not, we need to compute the expectation value.

Looking at the state psi: it's a symmetric combination of three particles where exactly two are up and one is down. Specifically, it's a superposition of all the states where two spins are up and one is down. Let me think about the possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles.

Three spin-1/2 particles can combine in different ways. The possible total spins can be 3/2 (triplet) or 1/2 (doublet). The state psi is in the subspace where two spins are up and one is down, which has a certain symmetry. Let me try to figure out the possible total spin quantum numbers.

Wait, actually, each term in psi has two up spins and one down spin. So, the z-component of the total spin S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = 1/2. So S_z = 1/2. Therefore, the state is in a subspace with S_z = 1/2. Now, for three spin-1/2 particles, the multiplets are either S=3/2 (which has S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2) or S=1/2 (which has S_z = 1/2, -1/2).

So the state psi is in the subspace with S_z = 1/2. To figure out whether it's an eigenstate of S_total^2 (which would make it an eigenstate of H), we need to see if psi is a component of the S=3/2 multiplet or the S=1/2 multiplet.

Let me try to construct the S=3/2 states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet (S=1/2) and triplet (S=3/2) states can be formed. The state with all three spins up is a part of the S=3/2 multiplet. Similarly, states with two spins up and one down can be part of the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplets.

But wait, actually, the singlet state for three spin-1/2 particles is the one with total spin S=1/2. The number of states in S=3/2 is 4 (since 2S+1=4), and the number of states in S=1/2 is 2.

Given that our state psi is symmetric in the two up spins and the one down spin, it's likely part of the S=1/2 multiplet because the S=3/2 multiplet would have more symmetric states. Hmm, maybe I should compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi and then use that to find the expectation value of H.

So, let's compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>.

First, note that S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, <S_total^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> + 2<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We know that S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 each have expectation value (3/4)ħ², so their sum is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

But we can also compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> directly.

Wait, but that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, let's compute <S_total^2> directly by expanding the terms.

First, note that |psi> is a symmetric state with two spins up and one down. Let's denote the basis states as |s1 s2 s3>, where each s_i is up (u) or down (d). The state |psi> is (|u u d> + |u d u> + |d u u>)/sqrt(3).

To compute <psi| S_total^2 |psi>, we can write S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so expanding this gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, <S_total^2> is the sum of expectations of each term.

As before, S1^2 etc. give 3/4 ħ² each, so their total is 9/4 ħ². Then, we need to compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> for the state psi.

Note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But maybe it's easier to compute <S_i·S_j> for each pair.

Let me compute <S1·S2> first.

In the state |psi>, which is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, let's see what are the possible terms when we apply S1·S2.

First, note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Compute <S1·S2>:

In the state |psi>, each term is |u u d>, |u d u>, |d u u>.

Let's compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in each term and then average.

First, in the state |u u d>:

S1^z |u> = (1/2)ħ |u>, S2^z |u> = (1/2)ħ |u>, so S1^z S2^z |u u d> = (1/2 ħ)^2 |u u d> = (1/4 ħ²) |u u d>.

Similarly, S1^x |u> = (ħ/2)(|d>), and S2^x |u> = (ħ/2)|d>, so S1^x S2^x |u u d> = (ħ²/4)|d d d>.

Similarly, S1^y |u> = (ħ/2i)(|d>), and S2^y |u> = (ħ/2i)|d>, so S1^y S2^y |u u d> = (ħ²/(-4))|d d d>.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of computing each term, it's better to use the fact that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be found based on their spin states.

Alternatively, for two spins in a state |s1 s2>, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_j^+ S_i^-) + S_i^z S_j^z.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,j}^2 - (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ²) where S_{i,j} is the total spin of particles i and j.

Wait, actually, S_i·S_j = [S_{i,j}^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2]/2. As we did earlier. So for two spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (S_{i,j}^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (S_{i,j}^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2.

But in the state |u u d>, we can compute S_{1,2}^2. If both particles 1 and 2 are up, their total spin S_{1,2} is 1 (triplet), so S_{1,2}^2 = (1)(1 + 1) ħ² = 2 ħ².

Similarly, for |u d u>, particles 1 and 3 are up and down? Wait, no, in |u d u>, particles 1 and 3 are up, particle 2 is down. So S_{1,2}^2: particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down. So their total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Specifically, the state |u d> is a singlet when combined with an overall factor.

Wait, actually, |u d> is orthogonal to the triplet states. So for particles 1 and 2 in |u d>, their total spin is 0, so S_{1,2}^2 = 0.

Similarly, in the state |d u u>, the first particle is down, particles 2 and 3 are up. So again, S_{1,2}^2: particle 1 is down, particle 2 is up. So again, their total spin can be 0 or 1. But in the state |d u>, it's a singlet or triplet. However, in the state |d u u>, the state of particles 1 and 2 is |d u>, which is a singlet.

Wait, maybe I need to think about each term in |psi> and compute S1·S2 for each.

Let's take the term |u u d>. In this state, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their total spin is 1. Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = 2 ħ². Thus, S1·S2 = (2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = ( (2 - 1.5)/2 ) ħ² = (0.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

Similarly, for the term |u d u>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down. Their total spin is 0, so S_{1,2}^2 = 0. Therefore, S1·S2 = (0 - 3/2 ħ²)/2 = (-3/4) ħ².

Wait, but in the state |psi>, each term is equally weighted, so we can compute the expectation value by averaging over each term.

So, each term in |psi> is |u u d>, |u d u>, |d u u>. For each term, compute <S1·S2>, then take the average.

In |u u d>:

S1·S2 = (S_{1,2}^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2. Since S_{1,2}^2 = 2 ħ², so (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.25 ħ².

In |u d u>:

S_{1,2}^2 = 0, so (-1.5)/2 = -0.75 ħ².

In |d u u>:

Similarly, particles 1 and 2 are |d u>, which is a singlet, so S_{1,2}^2 = 0, so again -0.75 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> for each term is:

For |u u d>: 0.25 ħ²

For |u d u>: -0.75 ħ²

For |d u u>: -0.75 ħ²

But since |psi> is a symmetric state, each term is equally likely. So the expectation value is the average of these three.

Wait, but actually, each term is part of the same state. So when computing <S1·S2>, we need to compute the expectation value over the entire state, not just average the three terms.

Wait, no, because in the state |psi>, each term is orthogonal and equally weighted. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each term multiplied by their coefficients squared, but since they are orthogonal, cross terms vanish.

So, in |psi>, which is (|u u d> + |u d u> + |d u u>)/sqrt(3), the expectation value <S1·S2> is equal to ( <u u d| S1·S2 |u u d> + <u d u| S1·S2 |u d u> + <d u u| S1·S2 |d u u> ) / 3, because the cross terms will involve S1·S2 acting on different basis states, which would be zero due to orthogonality.

Therefore, <S1·S2> is [0.25 ħ² + (-0.75 ħ²) + (-0.75 ħ²)] / 3 = [0.25 - 1.5] / 3 = (-1.25)/3 ħ² ≈ -0.4167 ħ².

Similarly, <S1·S3> will have the same expectation value because the state is symmetric under permutation of any two particles. The same goes for <S2·S3>.

Therefore, each <S_i·S_j> is -1.25/3 ħ².

Thus, the sum <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3*(-1.25/3) ħ² = -1.25 ħ².

Wait, that can't be. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, no, each pair has expectation value -1.25/3 ħ², so three pairs sum to 3*(-1.25/3) = -1.25 ħ².

But wait, let me re-express that. Each <S_i·S_j> is (-1.25)/3 ħ², so summing over three pairs gives 3*(-1.25)/3 ħ² = -1.25 ħ².

Therefore, going back to <S_total^2>:

<S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(-1.25) ħ² = (9/4 - 2.5) ħ². Converting 2.5 to quarters, 2.5 = 10/4, so 9/4 - 10/4 = -1/4 ħ².

Wait, that gives <S_total^2> = -1/4 ħ². Is that possible?

Wait, that would mean S_total^2 = -1/4 ħ², but S_total^2 is supposed to be (S(S+1)) ħ², where S is 3/2 or 1/2. For S=3/2, it's (3/2)(5/2) ħ² = 15/4 ħ². For S=1/2, it's (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². But here, we're getting -1/4 ħ², which is negative. That doesn't make sense. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me double-check the computation of <S1·S2>.

Earlier, I said that in |u u d>, S1·S2 = 0.25 ħ², and in |u d u> and |d u u>, S1·S2 = -0.75 ħ². So, adding these up: 0.25 + (-0.75) + (-0.75) = -1.25, then dividing by 3 gives -0.4167 ħ² per S_i·S_j.

But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating S1·S2 for each basis state.

Wait, let's go back. For the state |u u d>, particles 1 and 2 are both up. So their total spin is 1, which is the triplet state. Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = (1)(1 + 1)ħ² = 2 ħ². Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_{1,2}^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 = (2 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ². So that part is correct.

For the state |u d u>, particles 1 and 2 are up and down. So their total spin is 0, as |u d> is a singlet. Therefore, S_{1,2}^2 = 0. So S1·S2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -0.75 ħ². That's also correct.

Same for |d u u>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up, which is the same as |u d>, so again S_{1,2}^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = -0.75 ħ².

Therefore, the expectation value for each S_i·S_j is indeed -1.25/3 ħ².

So, summing the three gives -1.25 ħ².

Thus, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*(-1.25) ħ² = (9/4 - 2.5) ħ².

Convert 2.5 to quarters: 2.5 = 10/4, so 9/4 - 10/4 = -1/4 ħ².

Wait, but this suggests that S_total^2 is negative, which is impossible because S_total^2 is always non-negative. So, clearly, I made a mistake.

Wait, no, actually, S_total^2 is (S(S+1))ħ² where S can be 3/2 or 1/2, but in this calculation, I get a negative value, which is impossible. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the correct expression for S_total^2. Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, which includes cross terms. So, perhaps I should compute <S_total^2> directly by expanding all terms.

So, let's compute <S_total^2> = <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>.

We know that each S_i^2 = 3/4 ħ², so sum is 9/4 ħ². So, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ² + 2*( <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> ).

But from before, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = -1.25 ħ².

Thus, <S_total^2> = 9/4 + 2*(-1.25) = 9/4 - 2.5 = 9/4 - 10/4 = -1/4 ħ².

This is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>. Let me try a different approach.

Instead of computing <S_i·S_j> for each pair, let's compute <S_total^2> directly by considering the possible values of S_total^2 for the given state.

Given that the state has S_z = 1/2, it's part of either the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplet. If it's in S=3/2, then <S_total^2> = (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ² = (15/4) ħ². If it's in S=1/2, then <S_total^2> = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But in our calculation, we got -1/4 ħ², which is neither. Therefore, the state must be a linear combination of S=3/2 and S=1/2 states.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, which would mean it's not an eigenstate of H, and we need to compute the expectation value.

Wait, but to compute the expectation value of H, we need to compute <H> = A*( <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> ). From the earlier computation, this is A*(-1.25 ħ²).

But wait, the answer is supposed to be 2/3 A ħ². So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j separately.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

Note that the state psi is (|u u d> + |u d u> + |d u u>)/sqrt(3). Let's compute <S1·S2>.

Compute each term:

1. <u u d| S1·S2 |u u d>:

As before, S1·S2 = (S_{1,2}^2 - 3/2 ħ²)/2. For |u u>, S_{1,2}^2 = 2 ħ², so S1·S2 = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ².

2. <u d u| S1·S2 |u d u>:

Here, S_{1,2}^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -0.75 ħ².

Similarly,

3. <d u u| S1·S2 |d u u>:

Same as above, S_{1,2}^2 = 0, so S1·S2 = -0.75 ħ².

Also, cross terms:

For example, <u u d| S1·S2 |u d u>.

But since S1·S2 involves lowering and raising operators, the cross terms between different basis states might not vanish. This complicates the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that the expectation value of S_i·S_j for two spins in a state |s_i s_j> is ( (s_i · s_j) + 1/4 ) ħ², but I'm not sure.

Wait, another formula: For two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j in a state |s_i s_j> is given by ( <s_i s_j| S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z |s_i s_j> ).

But since S_i^z is diagonal, its expectation is straightforward. For S_i^x and S_i^y, we can compute their expectation values.

But perhaps it's easier to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, the possible values of S_i·S_j are:

- If the two spins are in a triplet state (S=1), then S_i·S_j = (1*(1+1) - 3/2)/2 ħ² = (2 - 1.5)/2 = 0.25 ħ².

- If the two spins are in a singlet state (S=0), then S_i·S_j = (0 - 1.5)/2 = -0.75 ħ².

Therefore, in our state psi, each pair of spins can be in either a triplet or a singlet state depending on the term.

In |u u d>, particles 1 and 2 are in a triplet state, so their S_i·S_j = 0.25 ħ².

In |u d u>, particles 1 and 2 are in a singlet state, so S_i·S_j = -0.75 ħ².

Similarly, in |d u u>, particles 1 and 2 are in a singlet state, so S_i·S_j = -0.75 ħ².

Therefore, when we compute <S1·S2>, we have contributions from each basis state.

But since the state psi is a superposition, we need to compute <S1·S2> correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the expectation value as follows:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = sum_{i,j} (1/3)( <u u d| + <u d u| + <d u u| ) S1·S2 ( |u u d> + |u d u> + |d u u> ) / sqrt(3).

Wait, actually, it's:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <u u d| S1·S2 |u u d> + <u u d| S1·S2 |u d u> + <u u d| S1·S2 |d u u> +

<u d u| S1·S2 |u u d> + <u d u| S1·S2 |u d u> + <u d u| S1·S2 |d u u> +

<d u u| S1·S2 |u u d> + <d u u| S1·S2 |u d u> + <d u u| S1·S2 |d u u> ]

So, that's 9 terms.

Now, compute each term:

1. <u u d| S1·S2 |u u d> = 0.25 ħ².

2. <u u d| S1·S2 |u d u>: S1·S2 acting on |u d u> gives something. Let's compute S1·S2 |u d u>.

S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

First, S1^z |u> = (1/2 ħ)|u>, S2^z |d> = (-1/2 ħ)|d>.

So, S1^z S2^z |u d u> = (1/2 ħ)(-1/2 ħ) |u d u> = (-1/4 ħ²) |u d u>.

Next, S1^x |u> = ħ/2 |d>, S2^x |d> = ħ/2 |u>.

So, S1^x S2^x |u d u> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |d u u> = (ħ²/4) |d u u>.

Similarly, S1^y |u> = (i ħ/2) |d>, S2^y |d> = (-i ħ/2) |u>.

So, S1^y S2^y |u d u> = (i ħ/2)(-i ħ/2) |d u u> = (-i² ħ²/4) |d u u> = (1*(ħ²)/4) |d u u> because i² = -1.

Therefore, S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z |u d u> = [ (ħ²/4)|d u u> + (ħ²/4)|d u u> ] + (-1/4 ħ²)|u d u>.

So, S1·S2 |u d u> = (ħ²/2)|d u u> - (1/4 ħ²)|u d u>.

Therefore, <u u d| S1·S2 |u d u> = <u u d| [ (ħ²/2)|d u u> - (1/4 ħ²)|u d u> ].

But |u u d> is orthogonal to |d u u> and |u d u>, so the inner product is zero.

Similarly, term 2 is zero.

3. <u u d| S1·S2 |d u u>: Similarly, S1·S2 |d u u> = ... Let me compute S1·S2 |d u u>.

S1^z |d> = (-1/2 ħ)|d>, S2^z |u> = (1/2 ħ)|u>, S3 is not involved here.

So, S1^z S2^z |d u u> = (-1/2)(1/2) ħ² |d u u> = (-1/4 ħ²)|d u u>.

S1^x |d> = ħ/2 |u>, S2^x |u> = ħ/2 |d>.

So, S1^x S2^x |d u u> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |u d u> = ħ²/4 |u d u>.

Similarly, S1^y |d> = (-i ħ/2) |u>, S2^y |u> = (i ħ/2)|d>.

So, S1^y S2^y |d u u> = (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) |u d u> = ( (-i)(i) ) (ħ²/4) |u d u> = (1)(ħ²/4) |u d u>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |d u u> = (ħ²/4)|u d u> + (ħ²/4)|u d u> - (1/4 ħ²)|d u u> = (ħ²/2)|u d u> - (1/4 ħ²)|d u u>.

Thus, <u u d| S1·S2 |d u u> = <u u d| [ (ħ²/2)|u d u> - (1/4 ħ²)|d u u> ] = 0, because |u u d> is orthogonal to both |u d u> and |d u u>.

So, term 3 is zero.

4. <u d u| S1·S2 |u u d>: Similarly, compute <u d u| S1·S2 |u u d>.

From earlier, S1·S2 |u u d> = (1/4 ħ²)|u u d> + ... Wait, actually, we have to compute S1·S2 |u u d> and then take the inner product with <u d u|.

Wait, S1·S2 |u u d> = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |u u d>.

Compute each term:

S1^z S2^z |u u d> = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |u u d> = (1/4 ħ²) |u u d>.

S1^x S2^x |u u d> = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) |d d d> = (ħ²/4) |d d d>.

S1^y S2^y |u u d> = (i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) |d d d> = (i² ħ²/4) |d d d> = (-1)(ħ²/4) |d d d>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |u u d> = (1/4 ħ²)|u u d> + (ħ²/4 - ħ²/4)|d d d> = (1/4 ħ²)|u u d>.

Thus, <u d u| S1·S2 |u u d> = <u d u| (1/4 ħ²)|u u d> = 0, since |u d u> is orthogonal to |u u d>.

So, term 4 is zero.

5. <u d u| S1·S2 |u d u> = -0
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin-1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as (1/sqrt(3))*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out whether this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value.

First, let's understand the state psi. It's a superposition of three terms where each term has two spins up and one spin down. Each term has one spin down in a different position. So, it's symmetric in a way because each particle gets to be the one that's down once. That might be useful later.

Now, the Hamiltonian involves the dot products of the spin operators. Remember that S1·S2 = (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z). So, the Hamiltonian is summing over all pairs of particles for their spin dot products.

Since the Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise spin interactions, maybe I can compute the expectation value by handling each term separately. That is, calculate <psi| H |psi> = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ). So, if I can compute each of these three expectation values, I can add them up and multiply by A to get the expectation value of H.

Now, the key thing is to compute each <Si·Sj>. Let's recall that the expectation value of the dot product of spins can be related to the total spin. Specifically, S_i · S_j = (S^2_ij - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2, where S^2_ij is the square of the total spin when considering particles i and j together. But I might need to think carefully here.

Wait, S_i · S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2. That's correct. Since each S_i is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2.

But in our case, the particles are in a state that is a product state for each pair? Or is it entangled?

Wait, no, the state psi isn't a product state, it's a sum over different spin configurations. So, each term in psi has two spins up and one down. So, when considering the expectation value of S_i · S_j, I need to compute the expectation for each term in psi, then add them up appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value for each pair.

Let me first note that since all the terms in H are symmetric in the particles, the expectation values for each pair should be the same. That is, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>. Therefore, the expectation value of H would be 3*A*<S1·S2>.

So, I just need to compute <S1·S2> for the state psi and then multiply by 3*A.

So, let me focus on computing <S1·S2>.

Now, S1·S2 = S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z.

Let me compute each component.

First, note that the state psi is an equal superposition of three states:

1. |up up down> (with the down on particle 3)
2. |up down up> (with the down on particle 2)
3. |down up up> (with the down on particle 1)

So, when I compute <S1·S2>, it's the expectation value over the entire state.

But since S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, and particle 3 is in a separate state, which is down in each term, but in different places. Wait, actually, in each term, the state is |up up down>, |up down up>, or |down up up>.

So, to compute <S1·S2>, I might need to look at the expectation value in each term and then average them, but considering the overall normalization.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in each term of psi, the state is such that either particles 1 and 2 are both up, or one is up and the other is down, depending on the term.

Wait, let's write out psi:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> ]

So, in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are up, particle 3 is down.

In the second term, particles 1 is up, 2 is down, 3 is up.

In the third term, particle 1 is down, 2 and 3 are up.

So, for each term, let's compute <S1·S2> for that term and then average, since psi is an equal superposition.

But wait, the expectation value is not just the average of each term's expectation, because the cross terms in the inner product might contribute.

Wait, actually, it's better to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>.

Which would involve computing the inner product of each component.

But since the state is a symmetric combination, maybe the cross terms will cancel? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the state has two spins up and one spin down in any given term. So, in each term, exactly two are up, one is down.

Wait, so in each term, either particles 1 and 2 are up (third term in psi), or 1 and 3 are up (first term), or 2 and 3 are up (third term? Wait no, let's see:

Wait, actually, in each term, the two ups are in different positions.

Wait, perhaps better to think of each term as having two ups and one down. So, when considering S1·S2, for each term, we can compute the value of S1·S2 for that term and then sum them over the three terms.

But I need to be careful because when computing the expectation value, each term is multiplied by its complex conjugate when taking the inner product.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of each component of S1·S2.

Alternatively, maybe to compute S1·S2 in terms of the total spin.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2.

But in our case, since each term is a product state, perhaps I can determine whether the state is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, maybe let's think about S1·S2.

Compute the expectation value <S1·S2> for each term.

So, for each of the three terms in psi, let's compute <S1·S2>.

First term: |up1 up2 down3>

In this term, S1 and S2 are both spin-up. So, S1z = ħ/2, S2z = ħ/2, so S1z S2z = (ħ/2)^2 = ħ²/4.

What about S1x and S2x? Well, for spin-up states, Sx and Sy can be represented in terms of |up> and |down> states. But in the expectation value, since we have |up1 up2> and we are taking the inner product with the same state, the expectation values of Sx and Sy might be more complicated.

Wait, actually, no. For a product state |up1 up2>, the expectation value of S1x S2x would be <up| Sx |up> * <up| Sx |up>.

But wait, Sx for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues that are not just ±ħ/2 for |up> and |down>, but actually, the expectation value <up| Sx |up> is (ħ/2) * (|up><down| + |down><up| ). So, the expectation value <up| Sx |up> is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each component.

Recall that for a spin-1/2 particle, the Pauli matrices are:

Sx = (ħ/2) σx, Sy = (ħ/2) σy, Sz = (ħ/2) σz.

So, S1·S2 = (ħ²/4)(σx ⊗ σx + σy ⊗ σy + σz ⊗ σz).

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> is (ħ²/4) [ <σx⊗σx> + <σy⊗σy> + <σz⊗σz> ].

Now, for a product state |a b>, where a and b are up or down, what is <σx⊗σx>?

Well, σx for spin-up is (|up><down| + |down><up|). So, <a| σx |a> would be the expectation value of σx for state |a>.

But for |up>, σx has expectation value 0, because σx |up> = |down> * something.

Wait, actually, more precisely, σx is a Hermitian operator, and for |up>, we have:

σx |up> = |down> and σx |down> = |up>.

But the expectation value <up| σx |up> = 0, because <up| σx |up> = <up| down> = 0.

Similarly, <σx> for |up> is zero. Same for σy. <σy> for |up> is also zero.

But <σz> for |up> is +1, and for |down> is -1.

Therefore, for a product state |a b>, the expectation value of σx⊗σx is <a|σx|a> <b|σx|b> = 0 * 0 = 0.

Similarly, σy⊗σy has the same expectation value, which is 0.

But σz⊗σz has expectation value <a|σz|a> <b|σz|b> = (1 or -1) * (1 or -1).

So, for the first term in psi: |up1 up2 down3>.

So, for S1·S2 in this term, we have:

<S1·S2> = (ħ²/4) [0 + 0 + (1)(1)] = (ħ²/4)(1) = ħ²/4.

Similarly, for the second term in psi: |up1 down2 up3>.

So, for S1·S2 in this term, we have:

S1 is up, S2 is down. So, <σz⊗σz> = (1)(-1) = -1. So, <S1·S2> = (ħ²/4)( -1 ).

Third term: |down1 up2 up3>.

Similarly, S1 is down, S2 is up. <σz⊗σz> = (-1)(1) = -1. So, <S1·S2> = (ħ²/4)( -1 ).

Wait, but hold on, that's just for each individual term in psi. But psi is a superposition of these three terms, each multiplied by 1/sqrt(3). So, the overall expectation value is not just the average of these three, because when you compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, you have to sum over all the terms.

Wait, to clarify, since psi is an equal superposition, the expectation value is:

<psi| S1·S2 |psi> = (1/3) [ <term1| S1·S2 |term1> + <term1| S1·S2 |term2> + <term1| S1·S2 |term3> + <term2| S1·S2 |term1> + <term2| S1·S2 |term2> + <term2| S1·S2 |term3> + <term3| S1·S2 |term1> + <term3| S1·S2 |term2> + <term3| S1·S2 |term3> ]

But because S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, and the third particle is in a definite state in each term, the cross terms can be non-zero only if the third particle's state is the same in both |termi> and |termj>.

Wait, let's see. For example, consider <term1| S1·S2 |term2>.

Term1 is |up up down>, term2 is |up down up>.

So, in term1, particle 3 is down, in term2, particle 3 is up. So, when we take the inner product <term1| S1·S2 |term2>, the S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, and particle 3 is in a definite state in both. But since term1 has down3 and term2 has up3, the inner product for particle 3 is <down|up> = 0. Therefore, <term1| S1·S2 |term2> = 0.

Similarly, any cross terms where the third particle's state differs will be zero.

Therefore, the only non-zero terms are the diagonal terms where the third particle's state is the same.

So, for <term1| S1·S2 |term1>, as above, it's (ħ²/4).

Similarly, <term2| S1·S2 |term2> = (ħ²/4)(-1).

Same for <term3| S1·S2 |term3> = (ħ²/4)(-1).

Therefore, the expectation value <psi| S1·S2 |psi> is (1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ].

Wait, that would be (1/3)( ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 ) = (1/3)( -ħ²/4 ) = -ħ²/(12).

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because, in the first term, S1 and S2 are up, so their dot product is positive. In the other two terms, S1 and S2 have opposite spins, so their dot product is negative. So, averaging these three, the first term is positive, the other two are negative.

So, 1/3*(positive + negative + negative) = 1/3*(1 - 1 -1 )*(ħ²/4) = (-1/3)*(ħ²/4) = -ħ²/12.

Hmm. So, <S1·S2> = -ħ²/(12). Since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), the expectation value of H is A*(3*(-ħ²/12)) = A*(-ħ²/4). Wait, but that contradicts the given answer which is positive 2/3 A ħ².

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that the cross terms are zero is incorrect.

Wait, no, let's think about it again.

When computing <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, we can think of it as:

Sum over i,j [ (1/3) <termi| S1·S2 |termj> ].

But as I thought before, because S1·S2 acts only on particles 1 and 2, the inner product will only be non-zero when termi and termj have the same state for particle 3. Because otherwise, <down3| up3> is zero.

So, for the third particle, in term1, it's down, in term2, it's up, in term3, it's up.

Therefore, term1 and term2 have different states for particle 3, so their inner product is zero. Similarly, term1 and term3: term1 has down3, term3 has up3, so inner product zero. Only term2 and term3 have up3, so when i=2 and j=3, the inner product is non-zero.

Wait, no. Wait, <termi| S1·S2 |termj> is non-zero only if termi and termj have the same state for particle 3, because S1·S2 doesn't affect particle 3.

So, term1 has down3, term2 has up3, term3 has up3.

So, the only non-zero inner products are when i and j have the same third particle state.

So, term1 only pairs with itself because it's the only one with down3.

term2 pairs with term3 because both have up3.

So, the cross terms are only between term2 and term3, and term1 only contributes when i=j=1.

Therefore, the expectation value is:

(1/3)[ <term1| S1·S2 |term1> + <term2| S1·S2 |term2> + <term3| S1·S2 |term3> + <term2| S1·S2 |term3> + <term3| S1·S2 |term2> ]

Wait, so the cross terms are non-zero for term2 and term3.

So, let's compute all the necessary terms.

First, <term1| S1·S2 |term1>:

As computed before, term1 is |up up down>, so <S1·S2> is (ħ²/4)(1) = ħ²/4.

Similarly, <term2| S1·S2 |term2>:

Term2 is |up down up>. So, S1 is up, S2 is down. So, <S1·S2> is (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4.

Same for <term3| S1·S2 |term3>:

Term3 is |down up up>. So, S1 is down, S2 is up, so <S1·S2> is (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4.

Now, the cross terms: <term2| S1·S2 |term3> and <term3| S1·S2 |term2>.

Term2 is |up down up>, term3 is |down up up>.

So, when we compute <term2| S1·S2 |term3>, it's equivalent to:

<up down up| S1·S2 |down up up>.

So, let's break this down.

S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2. So, in the state |down up up>, particles 1 and 2 are down and up respectively.

So, applying S1·S2 to |down up up> gives:

S1·S2 |down up> |up>.

But S1·S2 is (S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z).

So, let's compute S1·S2 |down up>.

We can compute each component:

First, S1z |down> = (-ħ/2)|down>, S2z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, so S1z S2z |down up> = (-ħ²/4)|down up>.

Similarly, S1x |down> = (ħ/2)(|up> + |down>), wait no, Sx for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2)[ |up><down| + |down><up| ].

Wait, no, actually, Sx |down> = (ħ/2)(|up>), because:

Sx = (ħ/2) [ |up><down| + |down><up| ]

So, Sx |down> = (ħ/2)|up>, because <down|down> =1, so it's (ħ/2)|up>.

Similarly, Sx |up> = (ħ/2)|down>.

Same for Sy, but with an imaginary unit.

But perhaps, since we are dealing with expectation values, maybe we can avoid getting into the matrix elements.

Wait, but for <term2| S1·S2 |term3>, we need to compute:

<up down| S1·S2 |down up> (particle 3 is up in both term2 and term3, so that part is okay).

So, <up down| S1·S2 |down up> = <up| S1·S2 |down> * <...but wait, no, S1·S2 acts on particles 1 and 2, so:

It's <1=up, 2=down| S1·S2 |1=down, 2=up>.

So, we have to compute <up down| (S1·S2) |down up>.

Which is <up| S1 |down> <down| S2 |up> + <up| S1 |down> <down| S2 |up> + <up| S1 |down> <down| S2 |up> ?

Wait, no, S1·S2 = S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z, so the expectation value is <S1x S2x> + <S1y S2y> + <S1z S2z>.

But since these operators act on different particles, the expectation values factor:

<1|S1x |1'> <2|S2x |2'> + similar for y and z.

So, <up down| S1x S2x |down up> = <up| S1x |down> * <down| S2x |up>.

Similarly for y and z.

Compute each term:

First, <up| S1x |down>:

S1x |down> = (ħ/2)|up>, so <up| S1x |down> = (ħ/2) <up|up> = ħ/2.

Similarly, <down| S2x |up>:

S2x |up> = (ħ/2)|down>, so <down| S2x |up> = (ħ/2) <down|down> = ħ/2.

So, the x-component is (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4.

Similarly for y-component:

<S1y> for |down> is (ħ/2)(i|up>), so <up| S1y |down> = (ħ/2)(i) <up|up> = iħ/2.

Similarly, <down| S2y |up> = (ħ/2)(-i) <down|down> = (-iħ)/2.

So, the y-component is (iħ/2)(-iħ/2) = (i*(-i))*(ħ²/4) = (1)*(ħ²/4) = ħ²/4.

For the z-component:

<S1z> for |down> is (-ħ/2), so <up| S1z |down> = (-ħ/2) <up|down> = 0.

Similarly, <down| S2z |up> = (ħ/2) <down|up> = 0.

So, the z-component is 0.

Therefore, the total expectation value <S1·S2> between term2 and term3 is (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) + 0 = ħ²/2.

Similarly, <term3| S1·S2 |term2> is the complex conjugate of the above, but since all terms were real, it's also ħ²/2.

Wait, but actually, when we compute <term2| S1·S2 |term3>, it's (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

Similarly, <term3| S1·S2 |term2> is the same, because the terms are symmetric.

Therefore, each cross term contributes ħ²/2.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value <psi| S1·S2 |psi> is:

(1/3)[ <term1| S1·S2 |term1> + <term2| S1·S2 |term2> + <term3| S1·S2 |term3> + <term2| S1·S2 |term3> + <term3| S1·S2 |term2> ]

Which is:

(1/3)[ (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (ħ²/2) + (ħ²/2) ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: ħ²/4

Second term: -ħ²/4

Third term: -ħ²/4

Fourth term: ħ²/2

Fifth term: ħ²/2

Adding these up:

(1/3)[ (1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2) ħ² ]

Compute the coefficients:

1/4 -1/4 -1/4 +1/2 +1/2

= (0) -1/4 +1

= ( -1/4 + 1 ) = 3/4

Therefore, total expectation value is (1/3)*(3/4 ħ²) = (1/4) ħ².

So, <S1·S2> = (1/4) ħ².

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation where I thought it was negative. So, the cross terms actually contribute positively.

So, in the end, the expectation value of S1·S2 is (1/4) ħ².

But wait, let's double-check the computation.

First, the diagonal terms:

<term1| S1·S2 |term1> = +ħ²/4

<term2| S1·S2 |term2> = -ħ²/4

<term3| S1·S2 |term3> = -ħ²/4

So, sum of diagonals: +ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 = -ħ²/4

Sum of cross terms:

Each cross term is ħ²/2, and there are two cross terms, so total cross terms: 2*(ħ²/2) = ħ²

Therefore, total sum before multiplying by 1/3:

( -ħ²/4 + ħ² ) = ( ( -1/4 + 1 ) ħ² ) = (3/4) ħ²

Multiply by 1/3: (1/3)(3/4 ħ² ) = (1/4) ħ².

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = ħ²/4.

Similarly, since the Hamiltonian is symmetric in all pairs, <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> will have the same expectation value.

Therefore, <H> = A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ) = A*(3*(ħ²/4)) = (3/4) A ħ².

Wait, but the given answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. No, wait, my calculation gave <S1·S2> as ħ²/4, but if you have three terms, each with <S1·S2> = ħ²/4, then total is 3*(ħ²/4). So, that would make <H> = A*(3/4 ħ²). But the given answer is 2/3 A ħ².

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of <S1·S2>.

Wait, let me go back.

When I computed <term2| S1·S2 |term3>, I thought it was ħ²/2. Let me verify that.

Wait, term2 is |up down up>, term3 is |down up up>.

So, <term2| S1·S2 |term3> is <up down| S1·S2 |down up>.

Which we computed as ħ²/2.

But wait, no, actually, in our earlier calculation, we broke it into x, y, z components.

For the x-component, we got ħ²/4, same for y-component, and z-component zero. So total was ħ²/2.

But, let's re-examine the cross terms.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the state is symmetric, so when you compute <S1·S2>, it's the same as <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>. But the given state has two spins up and one down, so it's a symmetric state?

Wait, actually, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of particles, because it's an equal superposition of all three possibilities where one spin is down. So, under permutation, the state remains the same.

Therefore, yes, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>.

So, if I computed <S1·S2> correctly, then the total energy should be 3 times that.

But according to my previous calculation, <S1·S2> is ħ²/4, so total <H> is 3*(A*ħ²/4) = (3/4) A ħ².

But the expected answer is 2/3 A ħ².

So, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S1·S2>.

Let me try another approach.

Another way to compute <S1·S2> is to note that S1·S2 = (1/4)[ (S1 + S2)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ].

But S1^2 and S2^2 are known: each is (3/4) ħ².

So, S1·S2 = (1/4)[ (S_total)^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) ].

So, S1·S2 = (1/4)( S_total^2 - (3/2) ħ² ).

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/4)( <S_total^2> - (3/2) ħ² ).

Now, in our state psi, what is the total spin S_total?

Wait, the state psi is |up up down> + |up down up> + |down up up> divided by sqrt(3).

This state is known as a symmetric state with two spins up and one down.

In such a state, what is the total spin S_total?

For three spin-1/2 particles, the combined spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

But let's see: the state psi has two spins up and one down. So, the total S_z is (1/2 + 1/2 -1/2) = 1/2. So, the total S_z is 1/2 ħ.

Therefore, the state has S_z = 1/2 ħ.

Now, the possible total spin states with S_z = 1/2 ħ can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

In the case of three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 (triplet) and 1/2 (multiplet).

But our state is symmetric, so it must belong to either the S=3/2 or S=1/2 representations.

Wait, actually, the fully symmetric state (all spins up) would have S=3/2.

But our state is a combination of states with two up and one down. So, it's part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

Wait, let me think. The singlet state for three spin-1/2 particles with S=1/2 has states with S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Wait, actually, no. The total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. For each, the possible S_z values are from -S to +S in steps of 1. So, for S=3/2: S_z = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

For S=1/2: S_z = 1/2, -1/2.

Therefore, our state psi has S_z = 1/2, so it can be part of either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But since it's symmetric under exchange, can it be in the S=3/2 multiplet?

Wait, actually, the S=3/2 multiplet includes the fully symmetric state |up up up>, and other states which might not be symmetric.

Wait, in fact, for three spin-1/2 particles, the S=3/2 states are symmetric under permutation, and the S=1/2 states include both symmetric and antisymmetric components.

But our state psi is symmetric, so it's part of the S=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, but our state has S_z = 1/2, so within S=3/2, there is a state with S_z = 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps not.

Wait, let me think again.

The state |up up up> has S_z = 3/2.

To get S_z = 1/2, we need two spins up and one down.

But the state we have is a symmetric combination of such states.

However, is this state an eigenstate of the total spin S^2?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of different S^2 eigenstates.

Wait, this might complicate things. Let me think differently.

Perhaps instead, let's compute <S_total^2> for our state psi.

If I can compute <S_total^2>, then I can get <S1·S2> using the formula.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, <S_total^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>.

We know that <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ².

So, <S_total^2> = 3*(3/4 ħ²) + 2*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ).

But since in our case, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = x, then <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 6x.

Therefore, x = ( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ħ² ) / 6.

So, if I can compute <S_total^2>, then I can find x = <S1·S2>.

So, what is <S_total^2> for our state psi?

Well, the state psi has S_z = 1/2 ħ.

But S_total^2 doesn't depend on the direction, so all states with the same S_total^2 will have the same expectation value regardless of S_z.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> by considering the possible S_total values.

If the state psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then we can know its value. Otherwise, if it's a combination, it's more complicated.

But given that the state is symmetric and has S_z = 1/2 ħ, it's plausible that it's part of the S=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, the S=3/2 multiplet has states with
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin-1/2 particles with a specific Hamiltonian, and I need to figure out if a given state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. If it is, I have to find the energy; if not, find the expectation value. The answer is supposed to be that it's not an eigenstate with an expectation value of (2/3)Aħ², but I need to work through it step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and the Si are spin operators for each particle. The state psi is given as (1/sqrt(3))*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). So, it's a symmetric combination of three states where in each term, two particles are spin-up and one is spin-down, but the spin-down particle is in a different position each time.

Okay, so the first question is: is psi an eigenstate of H? If it is, then Hpsi = E psi for some E, and E would be its energy. If not, then we have to compute the expectation value <H>.

I remember that for spin systems, the dot product of spin operators S_i · S_j can be expressed in terms of total spin operators. Specifically, S_i · S_j = (1/2)[(S_total)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2]. Since each particle is spin-1/2, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, each term in H can be rewritten as [S_total² - 3/4ħ² - 3/4ħ²]/2 = [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2.

But wait, H is the sum of three such terms: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²]/2 ). Let me check that: since each S_i·S_j term becomes [S_total² - (3/4 + 3/4)ħ²]/2 = [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2.

But the total spin operator S_total² is the sum S1 + S2 + S3 squared, which is S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total² = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2H/A.

Wait, let me write that down:

S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

But each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so S_total² = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2*(H/A).

So, rearranging, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 * A.

Wait, actually, earlier I had each S_i·S_j term as [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2. But summing all three, H would be A*( [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2 + [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2 + [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2 ). Wait, no, that would be 3*( [S_total² - (3/2)ħ²]/2 ). So, H = A*(3/2)*(S_total² - (3/2)ħ²).

But from the expression S_total² = 3*(3/4)ħ² + 2H/A, so plugging back in, perhaps we can express H in terms of S_total².

Wait, let's try that again.

We have S_total² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - (S1² + S2² + S3²))/2.

Each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², so S1² + S2² + S3² = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*( (S_total² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 ) = (A/2)(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²).

So, H is proportional to S_total², which is the square of the total spin.

Now, for the state psi, what is S_total² acting on psi?

I need to determine whether psi is an eigenstate of S_total², which would imply it's an eigenstate of H, since H is a function of S_total².

So, the key is: is psi an eigenstate of S_total²?

If yes, then it's also an eigenstate of H, and we can find the energy.

If not, then it's not.

What's the state psi? It's symmetric in all three particles, with two spins up and one spin down in each term, cyclically permuting which spin is down.

I recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric states with two up and one down are part of the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, let me think. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. The states with maximum total spin 3/2 are the fully symmetric states where all spins are up, or symmetric combinations with two up and one down.

But wait, the state psi is a symmetric combination with two up and one down, so it's part of the spin 3/2 multiplet? Or is it part of the spin 1/2?

Wait, actually, the states with total spin 3/2 have more symmetry. The state where all three spins are up is part of spin 3/2, as are other symmetric combinations. However, the state psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, which is different from the fully symmetric triplet with all up.

Wait, but there are multiple states in the spin 3/2 multiplet. The spin 3/2 multiplet has 4 states: |3/2, 3/2> (all up), |3/2, 1/2>, |3/2, -1/2>, |3/2, -3/2>. The states with two up and one down would be part of the spin 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, but in our case, the state psi is 1/sqrt(3) times (up up down + up down up + down up up). That is a symmetric state with two up and one down. So, it's an eigenstate of S_total² with eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/2)(5/2)ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

Wait, but hold on, if that's the case, then S_total² psi = (15/4)ħ² psi, which would make H psi = (A/2)(15/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) psi = (A/2)(6/4 ħ²) psi = (A/2)(3/2 ħ²) psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi. So, H psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi, which would make it an eigenstate.

But the answer is supposed to be that it's not an eigenstate, and the expectation value is (2/3)A ħ². So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe psi is not an eigenstate of S_total². Let me think again.

When you have multiple particles, the total spin can be tricky because the states can be entangled in different ways. The state psi is symmetric under permutations of the particles, as each term is a cyclic permutation of the others.

But being symmetric doesn't necessarily mean it's in the spin 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, in fact, I think the spin 3/2 multiplet for three spin-1/2 particles includes states that are fully symmetric, but the state psi isn't the same as those states. Let me check.

For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2.

The state with all spins up is |3/2, 3/2>, which is symmetric.

Other symmetric states can be obtained by lowering the spin, but the state psi is a symmetric state with two up and one down. Is that part of the spin 3/2 multiplet or spin 1/2?

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is part of the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, the dimension of the spin 3/2 multiplet is 4, and the spin 1/2 multiplet is 2. So, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total Hilbert space is 2^3 = 8 dimensional, which splits into 4 + 2 + 2 dimensions? Wait, no. Wait, when combining spins, for three spin-1/2 particles, the decomposition is:

Spin 3/2 (4 dimensions) and spin 1/2 (twice, each 2 dimensions). So total 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.

But the state psi is symmetric. How does symmetry play into this?

The spin 3/2 multiplet is symmetric, but the spin 1/2 multiplets are not symmetric?

Wait, actually, the spin 1/2 multiplets can be symmetric or antisymmetric? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states under exchange are those in the spin 3/2 and spin 1/2 multiplets.

Wait, perhaps the state psi is part of the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues. If psi is an eigenstate of S_total², then H would have a definite eigenvalue.

But since the answer says it's not an eigenstate, perhaps S_total² doesn't act diagonally on psi.

Wait, maybe I need to compute S_total² acting on psi and see if it gives a multiple of psi.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of H by computing the expectation values of each S_i·S_j.

Given that psi is symmetric, the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 should all be equal.

So, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>, so the expectation value of H is A*(3 <S_i·S_j>).

Therefore, if I can compute <S1·S2>, I can multiply by 3 and by A to get the expectation value.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>.

First, let's recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,z} S_{j,z} + S_{i,+} S_{j,-} + S_{i,-} S_{j,+}).

Alternatively, since we're dealing with eigenstates of S_z, perhaps it's easier to compute S_i·S_j in the basis of S_z eigenstates.

Wait, but in our state psi, each term is a tensor product of up and down states. So, to compute <S1·S2>, we can write it in terms of expectation values.

But first, let me note that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_{i,z} S_{j,z} + S_{i+} S_{j-} + S_{i-} S_{j+}).

Therefore, <S_i·S_j> = (1/2)( <S_{i,z} S_{j,z}> + <S_{i+} S_{j-}> + <S_{i-} S_{j+}> ).

But in our state psi, each particle is either up or down, so S_{i,z} is diagonal. Let's compute each term.

First, <S_{i,z} S_{j,z}>: for each term in psi, we can compute the product of the z-components.

But in our state psi, each term is a product of up and down states. So, for example, the first term is up1 up2 down3. So, in this term, S1z = ħ/2, S2z = ħ/2, S3z = -ħ/2.

Similarly, in the second term, up1 down2 up3, S1z = ħ/2, S2z = -ħ/2, S3z = ħ/2, and so on.

So, let's compute <S1z S2z>:

In the first term, up1 up2 down3: S1z S2z = (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = ħ²/4.

In the second term, up1 down2 up3: S1z S2z = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

In the third term, down1 up2 up3: S1z S2z = (-ħ/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

So, the expectation value <S1z S2z> is (1/3)( (ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) + (-ħ²/4) ) = (1/3)( ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 - ħ²/4 ) = (1/3)( -ħ²/4 ) = -ħ²/(12).

Similarly, since S1·S2 is symmetric in i and j, <S1z S2z> = <S2z S1z>, so same result.

Now, moving on to <S1+ S2->.

S1+ raises the spin of particle 1 from down to up, and S2- lowers the spin of particle 2 from up to down.

In our state psi, each term has either up or down for each particle. So, let's see which terms can contribute when we apply S1+ S2- to psi.

Take the first term: up1 up2 down3.

Applying S1+ to this term: S1+ acting on up1 gives 0, since it's already up.

Similarly, S2- acting on up2 gives down2, multiplied by ħ.

So, S1+ S2- acting on up1 up2 down3: 0 * something = 0.

Similarly, for the second term: up1 down2 up3.

S1+ acting on up1 gives 0.

S2- acting on down2 gives 0, since it's already down.

So, S1+ S2- acting on up1 down2 up3 gives 0.

Third term: down1 up2 up3.

S1+ acting on down1 gives up1, multiplied by ħ.

S2- acting on up2 gives down2, multiplied by ħ.

So, S1+ S2- acting on down1 up2 up3 gives ħ² * up1 down2 up3.

Therefore, S1+ S2- psi = (1/ sqrt(3)) [ 0 + 0 + ħ² up1 down2 up3 ] = (ħ² / sqrt(3)) up1 down2 up3.

But in our psi, up1 down2 up3 is the second term.

So, <S1+ S2-> = (1/3) * <psi | S1+ S2- | psi> = (1/3) * (1/sqrt(3)) (up1 down2 up3 | up1 down2 up3 ) (1/sqrt(3)) * ħ².

But the inner product of up1 down2 up3 with itself is 1, so this becomes (1/3)*(1/3)* ħ² = ħ² /9.

Wait, actually, wait: when you apply S1+ S2- to |psi>, you get (ħ² / sqrt(3)) |up1 down2 up3>, and then when you take the inner product with psi, which is (1/sqrt(3)) (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3>), the inner product is (1/sqrt(3)) * (ħ² / sqrt(3)) times the overlap between |up1 down2 up3> and the components of psi. Since |up1 down2 up3> is the second term, the inner product is (1/sqrt(3))*(ħ² / sqrt(3)) *1 = ħ² /3.

Wait, let me clarify:

<S1+ S2-> = (1/3) * (psi | S1+ S2- | psi )

= (1/3) * (1/sqrt(3)) ( <up1 up2 down3 | + <up1 down2 up3 | + <down1 up2 up3 | ) * S1+ S2- * (1/sqrt(3)) (|up1 up2 down3> + |up1 down2 up3> + |down1 up2 up3> )

The only non-zero term comes from when S1+ S2- acts on |down1 up2 up3> to give ħ² |up1 down2 up3>, and then the inner product <up1 down2 up3 | up1 down2 up3> is 1.

So, the total is (1/3)*(1/3)*(ħ²) = ħ² /9. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, actually, the calculation is:

psi is (1/sqrt(3)) (|a> + |b> + |c>), where a = up1 up2 down3, b = up1 down2 up3, c = down1 up2 up3.

Then, S1+ S2- acting on a: 0, on b: 0, on c: ħ² b.

Therefore, S1+ S2- |psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) (0 + 0 + ħ² b) = (ħ² / sqrt(3)) |b>.

Then, <psi | S1+ S2- | psi> = (1/sqrt(3)) ( <a| + <b| + <c| ) (ħ² / sqrt(3)) |b> ) = (ħ² / 3) <b|b> = ħ² /3.

Therefore, <S1+ S2-> = ħ² /3.

Similarly, <S1- S2+> would be the complex conjugate, but since everything is real here, it's the same. So, <S1- S2+> = ħ² /3.

Wait, but hold on, S1+ S2- and S1- S2+ are Hermitian conjugates, so their expectation values should be complex conjugates. But in this case, since we're dealing with real states, they are equal.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( <S1z S2z> + <S1+ S2-> + <S1- S2+> ) = (1/2)( -ħ² /12 + ħ² /3 + ħ² /3 ).

Compute that:

(1/2)( (-ħ² + 4ħ² + 4ħ²)/12 ) = (1/2)(7ħ² /12 ) = 7ħ² /24.

Wait, hold on, let me compute each term:

<S1z S2z> = -ħ² /12,

<S1+ S2-> = ħ² /3,

<S1- S2+> = ħ² /3.

So, adding them up: (-1/12 + 1/3 + 1/3) ħ² = (-1/12 + 8/12) ħ² = (7/12) ħ².

Then, multiply by 1/2: (7/24) ħ².

So, <S1·S2> = 7ħ² /24.

But wait, the expectation value of H is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ) = 3A*(7ħ² /24 ) = (7A/8) ħ².

But that's not matching the answer given. Wait, the answer is supposed to be 2Aħ² /3. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S1z S2z>.

Let me recompute <S1z S2z>.

In state psi, which is (1/sqrt(3))(a + b + c), where a = up1 up2 down3, b = up1 down2 up3, c = down1 up2 up3.

Compute <S1z S2z> = <psi | S1z S2z | psi>.

Compute each term:

For a = up1 up2 down3: S1z a = (ħ/2) a, S2z a = (ħ/2) a, so S1z S2z a = (ħ² /4) a.

Similarly, for b = up1 down2 up3: S1z b = (ħ/2) b, S2z b = (-ħ/2) b, so S1z S2z b = (-ħ² /4) b.

For c = down1 up2 up3: S1z c = (-ħ/2) c, S2z c = (ħ/2) c, so S1z S2z c = (-ħ² /4) c.

Therefore, when we compute the expectation value, we have:

<psi | S1z S2z | psi> = (1/3) [ <a| S1z S2z |a> + <a| S1z S2z |b> + <a| S1z S2z |c> + <b| S1z S2z |a> + <b| S1z S2z |b> + <b| S1z S2z |c> + <c| S1z S2z |a> + <c| S1z S2z |b> + <c| S1z S2z |c> ].

But since S1z S2z is diagonal in the computational basis, cross terms (like <a| S1z S2z |b>) will be zero because |a> and |b> are orthogonal.

Therefore, only the diagonal terms remain:

= (1/3) [ (ħ² /4) <a|a> + (-ħ² /4) <b|b> + (-ħ² /4) <c|c> + ... (other terms zero) ].

But since <a|a> = <b|b> = <c|c> =1, we have:

= (1/3) [ (ħ² /4) + (-ħ² /4) + (-ħ² /4) ) ] = (1/3)( -ħ² /4 ) = -ħ² /12.

So, that was correct.

Then, moving on to <S1+ S2->:

As computed earlier, <S1+ S2-> = ħ² /3.

Similarly, <S1- S2+> = ħ² /3.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( -ħ² /12 + ħ² /3 + ħ² /3 ) = (1/2)( (-1/12 + 4/12 + 4/12 ) ħ² ) = (1/2)(7/12 ħ² ) = 7 ħ² /24.

But the expectation value of H is A*( <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> ). Since the state is symmetric, each <S_i·S_j> is the same, so H = A*(3*(7 ħ² /24 )) = A*(7 ħ² /8 ) ≈ 0.875 A ħ².

But according to the problem, the answer is 2/3 A ħ². So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of <S1·S2>.

Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach.

Another approach is to note that for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = ( (S_total)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2.

So, for two particles, the expectation value <S1·S2> = [ <S_total²> - <S1²> - <S2²> ] / 2.

But in our case, for the full three-particle system, we have to consider S1·S2, but the total spin is S1 + S2 + S3.

Wait, but each pair is S1 + S2, S1 + S3, etc. Maybe this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value directly using the state psi.

Wait, let me compute <S1·S2> as follows:

Note that S1·S2 = (1/2)( S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z ).

But in the basis of up and down, Sx and Sy can be expressed in terms of raising and lowering operators.

But maybe it's easier to recognize that for two spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spin is 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet). The expectation value of S1·S2 depends on which state we're in.

But in our case, the two-particle state is not the same across all pairs because the third particle can be up or down.

Wait, but in our state psi, each pair (e.g., particles 1 and 2) can be in different states depending on the third particle.

Wait, for example, in the term up1 up2 down3, particles 1 and 2 are both up, so their combined state is |up up>, which is part of the triplet state with S=1, m=1.

In the term up1 down2 up3, particles 1 and 2 are up and down, so their combined state is |up down>, which is a superposition of triplet and singlet.

Similarly, in the term down1 up2 up3, particles 1 and 2 are down and up.

Therefore, the expectation value <S1·S2> isn't the same for all terms.

This complicates the calculation, but perhaps we can compute it term by term.

Wait, let's write down the state psi as |psi> = (|a> + |b> + |c>)/sqrt(3), where a = up1 up2 down3, b = up1 down2 up3, c = down1 up2 up3.

Then, <S1·S2> = (1/3) [ <a| S1·S2 |a> + <a| S1·S2 |b> + <a| S1·S2 |c> + <b| S1·S2 |a> + <b| S1·S2 |b> + <b| S1·S2 |c> + <c| S1·S2 |a> + <c| S1·S2 |b> + <c| S1·S2 |c> ].

Again, cross terms where |a>, |b>, |c> are orthogonal will vanish because S1·S2 is diagonal in the computational basis? Wait, no, S1·S2 includes Sx and Sy terms, which are off-diagonal.

Wait, actually, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z). The Sx and Sy terms are off-diagonal in the S_z basis, so their matrix elements between different basis states can be non-zero.

Therefore, computing <S1·S2> is more involved.

Let me compute each term:

First, compute <a| S1·S2 |a>. For the state a = up1 up2 down3, S1·S2 acting on |a> gives (1/2)( S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z ) |a>.

Since |a> has S1z = ħ/2 and S2z = ħ/2, so S1z S2z |a> = (ħ² /4) |a>.

For S1x and S2x, Sx = (S+ + S-)/2. Similarly, Sy = (S+ - S-)/2i.

So, S1x S2x = (S1+ + S1-)/2 * (S2+ + S2-)/2.

But acting on |a>, where both S1 and S2 are up, S1+ |a> = 0, S2+ |a> = 0. S1- |a> = ħ |down1 up2 down3>, but since S2 is up, it's still |down1 up2 down3>, and similarly for S2-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute S1x S2x |a>.

S1x = (S1+ + S1-)/2, so S1x |up1> = (S1+ + S1-)/2 |up1> = (0 + ħ S1- |up1>)/2 = (ħ/2) S1- |up1> = (ħ/2) |down1>.

Similarly, S2x |up2> = (ħ/2) |down2>.

Therefore, S1x S2x |a> = S1x |up1> ⊗ S2x |up2> ⊗ |down3> = (ħ/2 |down1> ) ⊗ (ħ/2 |down2> ) ⊗ |down3> = (ħ² /4) |down1 down2 down3>.

Similarly, S1y S2y |a> would involve similar terms but with factors of i.

But in our case, since we are taking the inner product <a| S1·S2 |a>, which includes <a| S1x S2x |a>, <a| S1y S2y |a>, and <a| S1z S2z |a>.

But S1x S2x |a> is proportional to |down1 down2 down3>, which is orthogonal to |a>, so <a| S1x S2x |a> = 0. Similarly, <a| S1y S2y |a> = 0.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |a> = <a| (1/2)(0 + 0 + S1z S2z ) |a> = (1/2)( ħ² /4 ) <a|a> = ħ² /8.

Similarly, compute <a| S1·S2 |b>. |b> = up1 down2 up3.

So, S1·S2 |b> = (1/2)( S1x S2x + S1y S2y + S1z S2z ) |b>.

Compute each term:

S1z S2z |b> = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) |b> = (-ħ² /4) |b>.

S1x S2x |b> = (ħ/2 |down1> ) ⊗ (ħ/2 |up2> ) = (ħ² /4) |down1 up2> ⊗ |up3> = (ħ² /4) |down1 up2 up3> = (ħ² /4) |c>.

Similarly, S1y S2y |b> = (iħ/2 |down1> ) ⊗ (-iħ/2 |up2> ) = (ħ² /4) |down1 up2> ⊗ |up3> = (ħ² /4) |c>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |b> = (1/2)( (ħ² /4)|c> + (ħ² /4)|c> + (-ħ² /4)|b> ) = (1/2)( (ħ² /2)|c> - ħ² /4 |b> ) = (ħ² /4)|c> - ħ² /8 |b>.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |b> = (1/2)( <a| S1x S2x |b> + <a| S1y S2y |b> + <a| S1z S2z |b> ).

But S1x S2x |b> has a component along |c>, and |c> is orthogonal to |a>, so <a| S1x S2x |b> = 0. Similarly, <a| S1y S2y |b> = 0. And <a| S1z S2z |b> = (-ħ² /4) <a|b> = 0.

Therefore, <a| S1·S2 |b> = 0.

Similarly, <a| S1·S2 |c> would involve terms where |c> is down1 up2 up3. S1·S2 |c> would involve terms like |up1 down2 up3> which is |b>. But when taking <a| S1·S2 |c>, it's similar to the above and would also be zero.

Similarly, <b| S1·S2 |a> would be zero, as would <b| S1·S2 |c>, and <c| S1·S2 |a> and <c| S1·S2 |b>.

The only non-zero terms are the diagonal terms <a| S1·S2 |a>, <b| S1·S2 |b>, and <c| S1·S2 |c>.

Compute <b| S1·S2 |b>.

|b> = up1 down2 up3.

So, S1z S2z |b> = (ħ/2)(-ħ/2)|b> = (-ħ² /4)|b>.

S1x S2x |b> = (ħ/2 |down1> ) ⊗ (ħ/2 |up2> ) = (ħ² /4)|down1 up2> ⊗ |up3> = (ħ² /4)|c>.

Similarly, S1y S2y |b> = (iħ/2 |down1> ) ⊗ (-iħ/2 |up2> ) = (ħ² /4)|c>.

Therefore, S1·S2 |b> = (1/2)( (ħ² /4)|c> + (ħ² /4)|c> + (-ħ² /4)|b> ) = same as before, (ħ² /4)|c> - ħ² /8 |b>.

Thus, <b| S1·S2 |b> = (1/2)( <b| S1x S2x |b> + <b| S1y S2y |b> + <b| S1z S2z |b> ).

Again, S1x S2x |b> is proportional to |c>, which is orthogonal to |b>, so <b| S1x S2x |b> = 0. Similarly, <b| S1y S2y |b> = 0. And <b
