<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>"Scientist aims to detect Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater. He took two wastewater samples (sample A and sample B) from two different sites.
For sample A, he used polyethylene glycol (PEG) for viral concentration, then he used an RNA extraction kit for RNA extraction. He found that A260/280 for extracted RNA was 2.1. Then, he converted RNA to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit. Then, he runs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction with the help of methyl red dye. He noticed that there there is no color change of the dye at the end of the LAMP reaction. Then, he runs a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on the cDNA, and found that ct is 20 knowing that the cut-off for ct value of this kit is 40.
For sample B, he used Centricon Plus-70 Centrifugal Filter 100 kDa MWCO Millipore for viral concentration, then the scientist used the same RNA extraction kit for RNA extraction. He found that A260/280 for extracted RNA was 2.2. Then, he converted RNA to cDNA using the same reverse transcription kit. Then, he runs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction under the same conditions with the help of methyl red dye. He noticed that the color of the dye had changed at the end of LAMP reaction. Then, he runs a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with the same condition and found that ct is 22 knowing that the cut-off for the ct value of this kit is 40.
Which of the following statement best to describes the negative LAMP result of sample A?
Why the correct answer is RNA extraction kit has to be replaced with another RNA extraction kit from another company to extract RNA with high quality.

Okay, so I need to figure out why Sample A's LAMP result was negative, even though the qPCR came back positive. Let me start by going through the details again. 

Sample A was processed using PEG for concentration, then an RNA extraction kit. The A260/280 ratio was 2.1, which I remember is within the acceptable range for RNA (usually around 2.0). So the RNA quality seems okay. They made cDNA and ran qPCR, getting a Ct of 20, which is way below the cutoff of 40. That means there was plenty of the target RNA, so the reverse transcription and qPCR worked fine.

But the LAMP test with methyl red didn't show a color change. LAMP is an isothermal amplification method, so it's different from PCR. It uses different enzymes and maybe different targets. The lack of color change suggests that the amplification didn't happen. 

Now, looking at Sample B, they used a different concentration method (Centricon) and the same RNA extraction kit. They got an A260/280 of 2.2, which is even better. Their LAMP worked (color changed) and qPCR Ct was 22, also well below 40. So Sample B worked as expected.

So why did Sample A's LAMP fail? Both samples used the same RNA extraction kit and the same RT and LAMP kits. The only differences are the concentration methods and the A260/280 ratios. But the A260/280 for Sample A is still good. Maybe the issue is with the concentration method? Or perhaps something else in the RNA extraction.

Wait, but the user's answer suggests replacing the RNA extraction kit. How does that fit in? If Sample A's RNA extraction kit is the same as Sample B's, but Sample B worked, maybe the kit itself isn't the problem. Unless... Maybe the RNA extraction kit for Sample A wasn't working properly. Like, maybe it was contaminated or faulty. Because even though the A260/280 is good, sometimes other factors like inhibitors can affect downstream reactions.

In PCR and LAMP, inhibitors can suppress the amplification. If the RNA extraction introduced some inhibitors, the LAMP might fail, but qPCR is more robust or the inhibitors were removed during the RT step. Or maybe the RT worked better for Sample A, but LAMP is more sensitive to inhibitors. Alternatively, maybe the RNA yield was lower, but the Ct was still low, so that doesn't seem likely.

Another thought: the LAMP reaction uses methyl red, which changes color based on pH. If the reaction didn't produce enough product, the pH wouldn't drop, so no color change. If the RNA was degraded, that could affect LAMP. But the qPCR worked, so RNA wasn't completely degraded.

So, could the RNA extraction kit be introducing inhibitors specific to LAMP? Or maybe the kit's performance was inconsistent. Since Sample B worked with the same kit, perhaps Sample A's extraction had an issue. Maybe the kit was old or contaminated. Alternatively, the concentration method (PEG) might have left some inhibitors that affected LAMP but not qPCR.
