[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield 0. The state of the system is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. Hmm, I think I need to use quantum mechanics here because we're dealing with observables and states, which are concepts from that field.

Let me recall. In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and the state is a vector in a Hilbert space. To find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (in this case, 0), I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and then compute the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and each eigenvector.

Wait, but first, is P a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Looking at P:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, the conjugate transpose would have the same elements since all the elements are real. So, P is equal to its transpose, which means it's symmetric. In real matrices, symmetric matrices are Hermitian because their transpose equals their conjugate transpose. So yes, P is Hermitian, which is good because observables should be Hermitian.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of the measurement, and the eigenvectors correspond to the states where the outcome is certain. Since I want the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then see how the given state relates to those eigenvectors.

But wait, maybe a faster way is to compute the expectation value of P and then find the probability that the measurement gives 0. Hmm, no, expectation value is the average outcome, but I need the probability. So, I think I need to stick with the eigenvalue approach.

So, first step: find eigenvalues of P.

I can do this by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let's write down P - λI:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Compute the determinant of this matrix. That will give me the characteristic equation.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be computed by expansion. Let's do it step by step.

The determinant is:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] ) + 0 * det(...)

Wait, the third term is multiplied by 0, so it disappears.

So, let's compute each minor.

First term: -λ times determinant of the submatrix:

[ -λ, 1/√2 ]

[1/√2, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) times determinant of submatrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0, -λ ]

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = (-λ)/√2

Third term: 0, so it's gone.

Putting it all together, the determinant is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ)/√2

Simplify:

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

Because (1/√2)*(1/√2) is 1/2, and the negative times negative gives positive.

So, -λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor this:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ² = 1, which gives λ = 1 and λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

Therefore, the possible outcomes when measuring P are 1, -1, and 0.

So, the probability of getting 0 is the sum of the squared moduli of the components of the state vector in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

Let's solve (P - 0I)ψ = 0, which is Pψ = 0.

So, the equations are:

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0

(1/√2)*x + 0*y + (1/√2)*z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0

So, simplifying these equations:

First equation: (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x

Third equation: same as the first, so y = 0.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, -x) = x*(1, 0, -1)

Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but let me check. The third equation is the same as the first, so we only have two unique equations: y=0 and x + z =0. So, the eigenvectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). So, yes, one-dimensional eigenspace.

Therefore, any vector in the eigenspace can be written as a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). So, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), up to normalization.

Let me normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Therefore, the eigenstate corresponding to λ=0 is ψ₀ = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

To find the probability of measuring 0, I need to compute the squared modulus of the inner product between |ψ> and ψ₀.

Wait, but actually, in quantum mechanics, the inner product is <ψ₀|ψ>, and the probability is |<ψ₀|ψ>|².

So, let's compute <ψ₀|ψ>.

ψ₀ is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], so its conjugate transpose is the same since all elements are real.

So, <ψ₀|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Therefore, the inner product is -sqrt(2). The modulus squared is | -sqrt(2) |² = (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Wait, but probability can't be more than 1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, hold on. I think I missed normalizing |ψ>. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning their norm is 1. Let me check the norm of |ψ>.

|ψ> is [-1, 2, 1], so its norm squared is (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state is not normalized.

But in the problem statement, it's given as the state of the system. Is it a normalized state? Or is it just any state? Because in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, but maybe in this case, they didn't normalize it. Hmm.

So, perhaps I need to normalize |ψ> before computing the probability. Alternatively, compute the inner product and then divide by the norm squared of |ψ> to get the probability.

Wait, no. Actually, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |<ψ₀|ψ>|² divided by <ψ|ψ> if the state is not normalized. But wait, no, actually, the state is a vector in the Hilbert space, and the probabilities are computed as |<ψ₀|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ> if |ψ> is not normalized.

Wait, let me recall. The general formula is that if |ψ> is a state vector, not necessarily normalized, then the probability of measuring outcome λ is |<ψ₀|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>, where ψ₀ is the normalized eigenvector.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if |ψ> is not normalized, you have to normalize the probabilities by the total norm squared.

So, in this case, let's compute:

First, compute <ψ₀|ψ> as we did before: -sqrt(2).

Then, compute <ψ|ψ> which is 6.

Therefore, the probability is | -sqrt(2) |² / 6 = (2)/6 = 1/3.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me double-check the inner product.

ψ₀ is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

ψ is [-1, 2, 1].

So, <ψ₀|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Yes, that's correct. So, the modulus squared is 2.

Then, the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), so squared norm is 6.

Therefore, probability is 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333...

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors. Let me double-check.

We had Pψ = 0.

So, the equations:

1. (1/√2)y = 0 ⇒ y=0

2. (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 ⇒ x + z = 0 ⇒ z = -x

3. (1/√2)y = 0 ⇒ y=0

So, the solution is any vector (x, 0, -x). So, ψ₀ is (1,0,-1), which I normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but let's test Pψ₀. Let me compute P times ψ₀.

P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 0, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 0]

So, Pψ₀ is:

First component: 0*1/sqrt(2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0

Third component: 0*1/sqrt(2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/sqrt(2)) = 0

So, Pψ₀ = [0;0;0], which is correct. So, ψ₀ is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is 1 because the state is in the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0. Let's check.

Wait, is the state ψ = [-1;2;1] in the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0? Let's see.

If I write ψ as a multiple of ψ₀, which is [1;0;-1], then ψ would be [-1;2;1]. Let's see if ψ is a multiple of ψ₀.

Is there a scalar α such that [-1;2;1] = α*[1;0;-1]?

That would require:

-1 = α*1 ⇒ α = -1

2 = α*0 ⇒ 2 = 0, which is not possible.

So, ψ is not in the eigenspace of 0. Therefore, the probability shouldn't be 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the inner product. Let me check again.

ψ₀ is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]

So, <ψ₀|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Yes, same as before.

But perhaps the observable is P, and the measurement outcome is 0. So, the probability is |<ψ₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||² = (2)/6 = 1/3.

But wait, maybe I need to consider all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0. But in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so there's only one eigenvector up to scalar multiples.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the operator P has rank 2, so the null space is one-dimensional, which we have already found.

Wait, let me check the matrix P again.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Is this matrix traceless? The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So, the sum of eigenvalues is 0. We have eigenvalues 1, -1, 0. So, that adds up to 0. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P represents a projection operator? Let's check if P² = P.

Compute P squared:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by P.

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, to compute P², we need to multiply P by P.

Let me compute the first row of P squared:

First row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by each column of P:

First column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second column of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, first row of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Similarly, second row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Multiply by first column: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, to compute the second row of P squared, we need to compute the dot product of the second row of P with each column of P.

Second row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

First column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Second column of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Third column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

So, second row of P squared is [0, 1, 0]

Third row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by first column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second column of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, third row of P squared is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Therefore, P squared is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

[0, 1, 0]

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Which is not equal to P. So, P is not a projection operator.

Therefore, going back, I think my initial approach was correct. So, the probability is 1/3. But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the observable is being measured in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the state is already in the eigenstate of P, so the probability is 1. But earlier, when I checked, ψ is not a multiple of ψ₀.

Wait, let's see:

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]

If ψ were in the eigenspace of P, then it would be a multiple of ψ₀ = [1,0,-1]. But ψ is [-1,2,1], which is not a multiple of [1,0,-1]. So, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is expressed in a different basis where P is diagonal, so that the components correspond to probabilities. But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value of P, but that's not the probability.

Wait, maybe I should compute the probability by considering all the eigenvectors. But since the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, and the state is not in that space, the probability is 1/3 as I computed earlier.

But the user says the correct answer is 1, so maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the state is orthogonal to the eigenspace, so the probability is 0, but that's not the case here because the inner product is -sqrt(2), which is not zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the measurement operator differently. In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular outcome is the trace of the projection operator onto that eigenspace multiplied by the density matrix. But since we're dealing with pure states, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|.

So, the probability is Tr( |ψ₀><ψ₀| |ψ><ψ| ) = |<ψ₀|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ> = 2/6 = 1/3.

Still the same result.

Alternatively, maybe the observable P is such that when you measure it, the state collapses into an eigenvector, and if the observable is idempotent, meaning P²=P, then it's a projection operator, but as we saw, P² ≠ P, so it's not idempotent.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is being measured in such a way that 0 is certain. But why would that be?

Wait, let me compute <ψ|P|ψ> and see the expectation value.

Compute <ψ|P|ψ>:

First, compute P|ψ>:

P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 0, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 +1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

So, P|ψ> = [sqrt(2); 0; sqrt(2)]

Then, <ψ|P|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1] * [sqrt(2); 0; sqrt(2)] = (-1)*sqrt(2) + 2*0 + 1*sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)) = 0

So, the expectation value is 0. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the average outcome is 0. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the probability of measuring 0 is 1. For example, if an observable can take values 1 and -1 with equal probability, the expectation value would be 0, but the probability of measuring 0 would be 0.

But in our case, the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So, the expectation value being 0 could be due to a combination of probabilities of 1 and -1 canceling each other out, and some probability of 0.

In our earlier calculation, we found the probability of 0 is 1/3. Let me check the probabilities of 1 and -1 to see if they sum up to 2/3.

So, to find the probability of measuring 1, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1.

So, let's find eigenvectors for λ=1.

Solve (P - I)ψ = 0.

P - I = [ -1, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, -1, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, -1 ]

Compute the system:

-1*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 → -x + (1/√2)y = 0 → x = (1/√2) y

(1/√2)x - y + (1/√2)z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)y - z = 0 → (1/√2)y = z

So, from first equation: x = (1/√2)y

From third equation: z = (1/√2)y

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 y) - y + (1/√2)*(1/√2 y) = 0

Compute:

(1/2)y - y + (1/2)y = (1/2 -1 +1/2)y = (-0)y = 0

So, the equation is satisfied for any y.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form:

x = (1/√2)y

z = (1/√2)y

So, ψ = y*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2)

Let me choose y=√2 to make it integer components:

ψ = √2*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2) = (1, √2, 1)

So, the eigenvector is (1, √2, 1). Let's normalize it.

Norm squared: 1² + (√2)² + 1² = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, norm is 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1, let's find the eigenvectors.

Solve (P + I)ψ = 0.

P + I = [1, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 1, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 1 ]

Compute the system:

1*x + (1/√2)y + 0*z = 0 → x + (1/√2)y = 0

(1/√2)x + 1*y + (1/√2)z = 0

0*x + (1/√2)y + 1*z = 0 → (1/√2)y + z = 0

From first equation: x = - (1/√2)y

From third equation: z = - (1/√2)y

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2 y) + y + (1/√2)*(-1/√2 y) = ?

Compute:

( -1/2 y ) + y + ( -1/2 y ) = (-1/2 +1 -1/2)y = 0*y = 0

So, the equations are consistent.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form:

x = - (1/√2)y

z = - (1/√2)y

So, ψ = y*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 )

Again, choosing y=√2 to make it integer components:

ψ = √2*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2) = (-1, √2, -1)

Normalize this vector:

Norm squared: (-1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, norm is 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2).

So, now we have the three orthonormal eigenvectors:

ψ₀ = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) for λ=0

ψ₁ = (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2) for λ=1

ψ_{-1} = (-1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2) for λ=-1

Now, let's express the given state |ψ> = [-1,2,1] as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.

So, |ψ> = a ψ₀ + b ψ₁ + c ψ_{-1}

We can write equations for a, b, c.

Compute a = <ψ₀|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Similarly, b = <ψ₁|ψ> = (1/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + (2*sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2) = (-1/2 +1/2) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Similarly, c = <ψ_{-1}|ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(2)/2)*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + (2*sqrt(2)/2) + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Therefore, |ψ> can be written as:

|ψ> = (-sqrt(2)) ψ₀ + sqrt(2) ψ₁ + sqrt(2) ψ_{-1}

Now, to find the probabilities, we take the squared moduli of the coefficients a, b, c.

So, |a|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2

|b|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2

|c|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2

But wait, the total norm squared of |ψ> is 6, as we computed earlier. So, the probabilities should sum to 1.

Wait, |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which equals the norm squared of |ψ>.

Therefore, the probabilities are:

P(0) = |a|² / ||ψ||² = 2 / 6 = 1/3

P(1) = |b|² / ||ψ||² = 2 / 6 = 1/3

P(-1) = |c|² / ||ψ||² = 2 / 6 = 1/3

Wait, but that's strange. The probabilities are all 1/3. But earlier, when computing <ψ|P|ψ>, we got 0, which is consistent because 1*(1/3) + (-1)*(1/3) + 0*(1/3) = 0.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, perhaps the user is mistaken. Or maybe I made a mistake in normalizing the eigenvectors.

Wait, let's check the normalization of ψ₁ and ψ_{-1}.

ψ₁ = (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)

Compute ||ψ₁||²: (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. So, yes, it's normalized.

Similarly, ψ_{-1} = (-1/2, sqrt(2)/2, -1/2)

||ψ_{-1}||² = (-1/2)^2 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 2/4 +1/4 =1.

So, they are properly normalized.

And ψ₀ is normalized: (1/sqrt(2))^2 +0 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2 +1/2=1.

So, everything seems correct.

Therefore, the probabilities are all 1/3. So, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3, not 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, let me read the question again.

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0), in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t. Why the correct answer is 1?"

So, the user is asking why the correct answer is 1. But according to my calculations, it's 1/3. So, perhaps the user is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is such that when you measure it, you always get 0, but that would require that the state is in the eigenspace of 0, which it's not.

Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the inner product.

Wait, let's compute <ψ₀|ψ> again.

ψ₀ = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]

So, <ψ₀|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So, |<ψ₀|ψ>|² = 2.

But the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), so 2/6 = 1/3.

So, I think my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is being measured in a different way, such as using the spectral decomposition.

Wait, another approach: the observable P can be written as the sum of its spectral projections.

So, P = 1*|ψ₁><ψ₁| + (-1)*|ψ_{-1}><ψ_{-1}| + 0*|ψ₀><ψ₀|

Therefore, when measuring P, the probability of getting 0 is the expectation of the projection onto ψ₀.

Which is exactly what we computed earlier: |<ψ₀|ψ>|² / ||ψ||² = 1/3.

So, I'm confident that the probability is 1/3, not 1.

Therefore, perhaps the user is mistaken, or perhaps there's a typo in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the state is different. Let me check the state again.

The state is given as (-1, 2, 1). If it were (1, 0, -1), then the probability would be 1. Or if it's a multiple, like (2, 0, -2), then the probability would still be 1 because it's in the eigenspace.

But with (-1, 2, 1), it's not in the eigenspace, so the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, the correct answer should be 1/3, not 1.

So, perhaps the user is confused or made a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the matrix P.

Wait, let me double-check the matrix P.

First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)

Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))

Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is being represented differently, such as in a different basis. But unless specified, I think the standard approach applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is being considered as a density matrix, but in that case, it's still the same process.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different space, like discrete vs continuous, but no, it's a finite-dimensional space.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the trace or something else, but no, the probability is computed via the inner product.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the observable has rank 1, but P has rank 2 because its eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.

So, it's a rank 2 operator, but it's still Hermitian.

Alternatively, maybe the operator P is a projection, but as we saw earlier, P² ≠ P.

So, I think my approach
[overthinking]
Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on a system will yield 0. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific entries. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, my first thought is that to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, I can project the given state onto that eigenvector and square the norm to get the probability.

But wait, let me make sure. Is that the right approach? I think so, yeah. Because the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector. So, if I can find the eigenvectors for P, especially for the eigenvalue 0, I can compute that inner product.

So, let me write down the matrix P first. It has three rows:

First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Hmm, so P looks like this:

[ 0      1/√2    0 ]

[1/√2   0      1/√2]

[ 0      1/√2    0 ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvalue we're interested in is 0. So, I should solve the equation (P - 0I)v = 0, which is just Pv = 0. The solutions to this equation will give me the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Let me write down the equations for Pv = 0.

So, if v is a column vector [x, y, z]^T, then:

First equation: 0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => (1/√2)y = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)x + 0*y + (1/√2)z = 0 => (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0

Third equation: 0*x + (1/√2)y + 0*z = 0 => (1/√2)y = 0

From the first and third equations, we get that y = 0.

Substituting y = 0 into the second equation, we have (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0. Let me multiply both sides by √2 to simplify:

x + z = 0 => z = -x

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 are of the form [x, 0, -x]^T, where x is any real number. Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [1, 0, -1]^T. To make it a unit vector, we can normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the unit eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So, now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let me denote this as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. To find the probability of measuring 0, I need to compute the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector |0> corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then square its magnitude.

Let me write down the eigenvector |0> as (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So, the inner product <0|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Wait, that gives me -√2. But probabilities are the square of the absolute value, so |<0|ψ>|^2 = | -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.

But hold on, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me check my calculations again.

First, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is [1, 0, -1]^T, normalized to (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. That seems correct because the norm squared is (1/2 + 0 + 1/2) = 1.

Then, the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The inner product is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2. So, the absolute value squared is indeed 2. Wait, that's 2, which is greater than 1. That can't be a probability.

Hmm, that's impossible because probabilities are between 0 and 1. So, I must have messed up something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector? Let me re-examine the eigenvalue equation.

So, for eigenvalue 0, we have Pv = 0. Let me write out the equations again.

First equation: (1/√2)y = 0 => y = 0

Second equation: (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => z = -x

Third equation: same as first, y = 0.

So, eigenvectors are of the form [x, 0, -x]^T. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the eigenspace more carefully? Hmm, no, it's one-dimensional.

Wait, but what if the matrix P has rank 2? Then, the null space (eigenspace for eigenvalue 0) is of dimension 1. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but maybe my approach is wrong. Maybe I should be using the projection operator instead of just taking the inner product. Because in quantum mechanics, the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace.

Wait, but since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection operator is |0><0|, and the probability is <ψ|0><0|ψ> = |<0|ψ>|^2, which is what I computed. So, that should be correct.

But why is it giving me 2? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I messed up the state vector. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is that a column vector? Yes. So, [-1; 2; 1]. So, when I compute the inner product, I have to take the conjugate transpose of the eigenvector and multiply by the state vector.

Wait, eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T, so the conjugate transpose is the same since the entries are real. So, <0|ψ> is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So, |<0|ψ>|^2 = (-√2)^2 = 2. Hmm, still 2.

But that's impossible because probabilities can't be more than 1. So, something's definitely wrong here.

Wait, maybe the state vector isn't normalized? Let me check. The state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So, norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state isn't normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it first.

Because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. If the state isn't normalized, then the probabilities might not sum to 1. So, perhaps that's the issue.

So, let me compute the norm of the state vector |ψ>:

||ψ|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So, the state vector has length sqrt(6). Therefore, to get a unit vector, we divide each component by sqrt(6).

So, the normalized state vector is:

|ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Therefore, the inner product <0|ψ_normalized> is (1/√2)(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/√2)(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(√2*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(√2*sqrt(6)) = (-2)/(√2*sqrt(6)).

Simplify that: √2*sqrt(6) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So, (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3).

Therefore, |<0|ψ_normalized>|^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that makes more sense because it's less than 1. But the user said the correct answer is 1. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps.

First, P is the observable matrix. I found that the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 are [x, 0, -x]^T. Then, normalized to (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T, which is not normalized. So, we need to normalize it.

So, |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Then, the inner product <0|ψ_normalized> is (1/√2)(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1/√2)(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1 -1)/(√2*sqrt(6)) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3).

Therefore, the probability is | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = 1/3.

But the user said the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that suggests that I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P has a different structure? Let me check P again.

Wait, P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, is this matrix symmetric? Yes, because P^T = P. So, it's Hermitian, which is good because observables are Hermitian.

Let me compute the eigenvalues of P to make sure.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

So, determinant of:

[ -λ      1/√2      0     ]

[1/√2    -λ      1/√2   ]

[ 0      1/√2     -λ     ]

Compute this determinant.

Hmm, calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let's do it step by step.

The determinant is:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, more systematically:

det(P - λI) = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

So, first term: -λ * [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2

Third term: 0, so we can ignore.

So, overall determinant:

-λ*(λ^2 - 1/2) + (λ)/2

= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

= -λ^3 + λ

So, determinant equation: -λ^3 + λ = 0 => λ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0

Thus, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So, that means that when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. So, probability of getting 0 is 1/3, as I computed earlier. But the user said the correct answer is 1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvectors? Let me verify.

For eigenvalue 0, we have [x, 0, -x]^T as eigenvectors, correct?

But let me check if there are more eigenvectors. Because if the eigenspace is more than one-dimensional, that might change things.

But in our case, the eigenspace for 0 was one-dimensional because the rank of P is 2, so nullity is 1. So, yes, one eigenvector for 0.

But let me check what's the eigenvector for 1 and -1.

For eigenvalue 1:

Solve (P - I)v = 0.

So, matrix:

[ -1     1/√2     0     ]

[1/√2    -1     1/√2   ]

[ 0     1/√2     -1     ]

Let me write the equations:

-1*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => -x + (y)/√2 = 0 ...(1)

(1/√2)x - y + (1/√2)z = 0 ...(2)

0*x + (1/√2)y - z = 0 => (y)/√2 - z = 0 ...(3)

From equation (1): x = y / √2

From equation (3): z = y / √2

Substitute x and z into equation (2):

(1/√2)*(y / √2) - y + (1/√2)*(y / √2) = 0

Simplify:

(1/2)y - y + (1/2)y = (1/2 -1 + 1/2)y = (-0)y = 0.

So, it's satisfied for any y. So, the eigenvectors are of the form [y/√2, y, y/√2]^T, which can be written as y*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2)^T.

So, the eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)^T. To make it a unit vector, since the norm is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, unit eigenvector is (1/√2, 1/√2, 1/√2)^T.

Wait, no. Wait, the norm of (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, to normalize, we divide by sqrt(2), giving (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T? Wait, no.

Wait, no. The vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). The norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2. So, norm is sqrt(2). Therefore, unit vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, let me compute that:

(1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/2

1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)

Similarly, the third component is 1/2.

So, the unit eigenvector is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1, we can solve (P + I)v = 0.

Matrix:

[1     1/√2     0     ]

[1/√2    1     1/√2   ]

[0     1/√2     1     ]

Equations:

1*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 => x + y / √2 = 0 ...(4)

(1/√2)x + 1*y + (1/√2)z = 0 ...(5)

0*x + (1/√2)y + 1*z = 0 => y / √2 + z = 0 ...(6)

From equation (4): x = - y / √2

From equation (6): z = - y / √2

Substitute into equation (5):

(1/√2)*(- y / √2) + y + (1/√2)*(- y / √2) = 0

Simplify:

(-1/2)y + y + (-1/2)y = (-1/2 + 1 -1/2)y = 0*y = 0

So, any y satisfies it. So, eigenvectors are [ -y / √2, y, - y / √2 ]^T, which is y*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2)^T.

So, unit eigenvector is (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2)^T normalized.

Wait, the norm of (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2) is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, unit vector is (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T.

Okay, so now, we have three orthonormal eigenvectors:

For eigenvalue 0: (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T

For eigenvalue 1: (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T

For eigenvalue -1: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T

Now, let me check if they are orthonormal.

Let me compute the inner product between eigenvectors for 0 and 1.

(1/√2)(1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/√2)(1/2) = (1/(2√2)) + 0 + (-1/(2√2)) = 0. So, orthogonal.

Similarly, between 0 and -1:

(1/√2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/√2)(-1/2) = (-1/(2√2)) + 0 + (1/(2√2)) = 0. Orthogonal.

Between 1 and -1:

(1/2)(-1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/2)(-1/2) = (-1/4) + (1/2) + (-1/4) = (-1/4 -1/4) + 1/2 = (-1/2) + 1/2 = 0. Orthogonal.

So, they form an orthonormal basis. Good.

Now, given that, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. As we saw earlier, it's not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(6). So, to compute probabilities, we should express |ψ> in terms of the orthonormal eigenvectors, and then square the coefficients.

So, let me write |ψ> as a linear combination of the eigenvectors:

|ψ> = a|0> + b|1> + c|-1>

Where |0>, |1>, |-1> are the orthonormal eigenvectors.

So, we can compute a, b, c by taking inner products:

a = <0|ψ>

b = <1|ψ>

c = <-1|ψ>

But since |ψ> isn't normalized, these coefficients will give us the components, and the probabilities will be |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2 divided by ||ψ||^2.

Wait, no. Actually, since the eigenvectors are orthonormal, we can write |ψ> = (a|0> + b|1> + c|-1>) / ||ψ||, but in our case, |ψ> is not normalized, so the coefficients directly give the components, but to get the probabilities, we need to normalize.

Wait, let me think.

If |ψ> is not normalized, then to compute the probability of measuring 0, we compute |<0|ψ>|^2 / ||ψ||^2.

Yes, that's correct.

Because in general, if |ψ> is not a unit vector, then the probability is |<v|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>, where v is the unit eigenvector.

So, in our case, <0|ψ> is (-√2), as computed earlier, and ||ψ||^2 is 6.

So, the probability is |(-√2)|^2 / 6 = (2)/6 = 1/3.

Similarly, compute <1|ψ>:

|1> is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)^T.

So, inner product <1|ψ> is (1/2)(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))(2) + (1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + (2/sqrt(2)) + (1/2) = ( -1/2 + 1/2 ) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

So, |sqrt(2)|^2 / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Similarly, < -1 | ψ >:

| -1 > is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T.

Inner product: (-1/2)(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))(2) + (-1/2)(1) = (1/2) + (2/sqrt(2)) + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

So, |sqrt(2)|^2 / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

So, all three probabilities are 1/3 each.

But the user is asking for the probability of measuring 0, which is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, why is that?

Wait, maybe the user is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the observable is being measured in a different basis, or perhaps I misunderstood the structure of P.

Wait, let me see. Alternatively, maybe P is not diagonal, so when you measure, the possible outcomes are only the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squares of the projections.

But in our case, we've correctly computed the probability as 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is already in the eigenbasis of P, making the probability either 0 or 1.

Wait, is the state |ψ> an eigenvector of P?

Let me check by multiplying P with |ψ>.

Compute P|ψ>:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = (2)/√2 = sqrt(2)

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 +1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = (2)/√2 = sqrt(2)

So, P|ψ> = [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T.

Compare to |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Clearly, P|ψ> ≠ λ|ψ> for any λ, so |ψ> is not an eigenvector of P. Therefore, the probability isn't 0 or 1.

So, the probability should be 1/3 as computed.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is 1. Maybe the user is thinking that the state is in the null space of P, so the probability is 1, but no, the state is not in the null space.

Wait, is the state in the null space? Let me check.

Null space of P is the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0, which is [x, 0, -x]^T. So, is [-1, 2, 1]^T a scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T?

No, because the second component is 2, which doesn't match 0. So, the state isn't in the null space.

Therefore, the probability shouldn't be 1.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the observable? Maybe the observable is P, but in the problem, perhaps it's being measured as an observable, and maybe it's a projection operator, but in this case, P is a Hermitian matrix, not a projection operator.

Wait, if P is a projection operator, then it would be idempotent, but in our case, P^2 is not equal to P.

Let me compute P^2:

P^2 = P * P.

Compute the first row:

First row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by first column of P: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Multiply by second column: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Multiply by third column: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, first row of P^2: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Similarly, second row:

Second row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Multiply by first column: (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Multiply by second column: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Multiply by third column: (1/√2)*0 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*0 = 0

So, second row of P^2: [0, 1, 0]

Third row of P^2:

Third row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by first column: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Multiply by second column: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Multiply by third column: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, third row of P^2: [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Therefore, P^2 is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

[0, 1, 0]

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Which is not equal to P. Therefore, P is not a projection operator, just a Hermitian matrix.

So, my original approach was correct.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3, not 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, perhaps the user is mistaken.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was about a different observable, or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, let me re-read the problem.

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t. Why the correct answer is 1?"

Wait, so the user is asking why the correct answer is 1, implying that the probability is 1, but according to my calculations, it's 1/3.

So, maybe the user is confused, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is being interpreted differently.

Wait, is the state vector [-1, 2, 1]^T or is it a density matrix? Because if it's a density matrix, then things change, but the problem states it's a state of the system, so it should be a pure state, i.e., a column vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is being measured in a different way.

Wait, but if the state is not normalized, and if the observable is such that the state is in the null space, but as we saw, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has 0 as its only eigenvalue, which is not the case because we found eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is being considered in a different basis where the state is represented differently.

Wait, unless the observable P is actually being considered as a projection operator, but as we saw, P^2 ≠ P.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the expectation value instead of the probability. But no, the question is about the probability.

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking that since the system is in the null space, the probability is 1, but as we saw, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is not correctly normalized.

Wait, no. We have the eigenvector [1, 0, -1]^T, which when normalized is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

Then, the inner product with the state [-1, 2, 1]^T is (-1)(1/√2) + 0 + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

So, |<0|ψ>|^2 = 2.

But since the state isn't normalized, we have to divide by ||ψ||^2 = 6, so 2/6 = 1/3.

Therefore, probability is 1/3.

Unless the observable is being considered in a different way, I can't see how the probability would be 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is being interpreted as a density matrix. Let's explore that.

If the state is a density matrix ρ, then the probability of measuring 0 would be Tr(ρ P_0), where P_0 is the projection onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

But in the problem, it says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix", which typically refers to a pure state, not a density matrix.

But just for the sake of exploration, let's compute.

If ρ is a density matrix, it's usually a positive semi-definite matrix with trace 1. But the given state is a column vector [-1, 2, 1]^T. If we interpret this as a density matrix, it would be |ψ><ψ|, but then ρ would be 3x3, but the given vector is 3x1, so that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of state.

Alternatively, maybe the user confused the state with the density matrix. Let me compute Tr(ρ P_0), where ρ is |ψ><ψ|.

Compute ρ = |ψ><ψ|, where |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So, ρ is:

[1, -2, -1;

-2, 4, 2;

-1, 2, 1]

Then, P_0 is the projection onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0, which is the outer product of the unit eigenvector |0> with itself.

So, |0> is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T. So, P_0 = |0><0| is:

[1/2, 0, -1/2;

0, 0, 0;

-1/2, 0, 1/2]

Then, Tr(ρ P_0) = sum_{i} ρ_{i,j} P_0_{j,i}

So, compute each element:

First diagonal element: ρ_{1,1} P_0_{1,1} + ρ_{1,2} P_0_{2,1} + ρ_{1,3} P_0_{3,1}

Wait, no, the trace is sum_{i} (ρ P_0)_{i,i}.

But to compute (ρ P_0)_{i,i}, it's the sum over j of ρ_{i,j} P_0_{j,i}.

So, compute each diagonal element:

First diagonal: i=1

sum_{j=1}^3 ρ_{1,j} P_0_{j,1} = ρ_{1,1} P_0_{1,1} + ρ_{1,2} P_0_{2,1} + ρ_{1,3} P_0_{3,1}

= (1)(1/2) + (-2)(0) + (-1)(-1/2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

Second diagonal: i=2

sum_{j=1}^3 ρ_{2,j} P_0_{j,2} = ρ_{2,1} P_0_{1,2} + ρ_{2,2} P_0_{2,2} + ρ_{2,3} P_0_{3,2}

= (-2)(0) + (4)(0) + (2)(0) = 0

Third diagonal: i=3

sum_{j=1}^3 ρ_{3,j} P_0_{j,3} = ρ_{3,1} P_0_{1,3} + ρ_{3,2} P_0_{2,3} + ρ_{3,3} P_0_{3,3}

= (-1)(-1/2) + (2)(0) + (1)(1/2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

So, the diagonal elements of ρ P_0 are [1, 0, 1]. Therefore, Tr(ρ P_0) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

But the trace should give the probability,
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out why the probability of measuring 0 for the observable P at time t is 1. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's write down the state vector. It's a column vector:

\[ \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

I should probably check if this vector is normalized. To be normalized, the sum of the squares of its components should equal 1. Let me calculate that:

\[ (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \]

Hmm, that's 6, not 1. So the vector isn't normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. To normalize, I'll divide each component by the square root of 6.

So, the normalized state vector \( \psi_{normalized} \) would be:

\[ \psi_{normalized} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P is such that it doesn't require normalization? I'm not sure. Let's see.

Next, the observable P is a matrix operator given by:

\[ P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix} \]

I need to calculate the probability that measuring P yields 0. In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So, first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Let me try finding the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \).

Calculating the determinant of \( P - \lambda I \):

\[ \det \begin{bmatrix}
- \lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & - \lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & - \lambda
\end{bmatrix} = 0 \]

Let's compute this determinant. Expanding along the first row:

\[ -\lambda \cdot \det \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \det \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} + 0 \cdot \det(...) \]

The third term is zero, so we can ignore it.

Compute the first minor:

\[ \det \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \]

Compute the second minor:

\[ \det \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-\lambda) \right) - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 \right) = -\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Putting it all together:

\[ -\lambda (\lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2}) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}} \right ) = 0 \]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( -\lambda^3 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \)

Second term: \( - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}) = \frac{\lambda}{2} \)

So overall:

\[ -\lambda^3 + \frac{\lambda}{2} + \frac{\lambda}{2} = 0 \]

Simplify:

\[ -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \]

Factor out \(-\lambda\):

\[ -\lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \]

So, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \) and \( \lambda = -1 \).

So, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is non-zero.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 to construct the projection operator.

Let me find the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \). So, we solve \( (P - 0 I) x = 0 \), which is \( P x = 0 \).

So, writing the equations:

First row: \( 0 x_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x_2 + 0 x_3 = 0 \) => \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x_2 = 0 \) => \( x_2 = 0 \)

Second row: \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x_1 + 0 x_2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x_3 = 0 \) => \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x_1 + x_3) = 0 \) => \( x_1 + x_3 = 0 \)

Third row: \( 0 x_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x_2 + 0 x_3 = 0 \) => same as the first row, \( x_2 = 0 \)

So, from first and third equations, \( x_2 = 0 \). From the second equation, \( x_1 = -x_3 \)

So, the eigenvectors are of the form \( x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ 0 \\ -x_1 \end{bmatrix} = x_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Therefore, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by \( v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Thus, the projection operator onto this eigenspace is \( |v\rangle \langle v| \), where \( |v\rangle \) is the normalized eigenvector.

First, check if \( v \) is normalized:

\( v \cdot v = 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \), so the normalized eigenvector is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v \).

So, the projection operator is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the expectation value of the projection operator acting on the state vector \( \psi \). So, compute:

\[ P_{\psi}(0) = \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \]

But wait, I need to clarify: since the state might not be normalized, I should probably normalize it first. Earlier, I saw that \( \psi \) has a norm squared of 6. So, if I use the original \( \psi \), the probability will be scaled by 6.

But perhaps since the question is about probability, it's better to normalize the state first.

Let me proceed with the normalized state \( \psi_{normalized} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

So, compute \( \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \):

First, compute \( \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \):

\[ \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Compute the matrix-vector product:

First component: \( 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 -1 = -2 \)

Second component: \( 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0 \)

Third component: \( (-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

So, the result is \( \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \). Then multiply by 1/2: \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle = \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \)

Wait, actually, since \( \text{Proj} \) is the projection operator, the probability is the squared norm of \( \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \). Alternatively, since we have a normalized state, it's the inner product of \( \psi \) with \( \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \).

Wait, no, actually, the probability is \( \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \), but \( \text{Proj} \) is a projection operator, so it's a linear operator. So, more precisely, it's the expectation value of the projection operator, which is equal to the squared norm of the projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenspace.

But since \( \text{Proj} \) is a rank-1 projection operator, this expectation is equal to \( |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 \), where \( v \) is the normalized eigenvector.

So, \( v \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \)

So, compute \( \langle v | \psi \rangle \):

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1 \quad 0 \quad -1] \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (-1 -1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2} \]

Then, the squared modulus is \( | -\sqrt{2} |^2 = 2 \)

But since the state \( \psi \) is not normalized, we have to consider the norm. The norm of \( \psi \) is \( \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \psi \)

Therefore, the inner product becomes \( \langle v | \psi \rangle = -\sqrt{2} \), so the probability is \( |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 / ||\psi||^2 \) if we consider the state not normalized, or just \( |\langle v | \psi_{normalized} \rangle|^2 \) if we use the normalized state.

Wait, I might be confusing things here. Let me think.

The probability is given by \( P = \frac{|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} \), because \( \psi \) isn't necessarily normalized.

So, in our case:

\( \langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1 \quad 0 \quad -1] \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = ( -\sqrt{2} )^2 = 2 \)

And \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \)

Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)

Wait, that's not 1. Hmm, but the question says the correct answer is 1. So, something must be wrong in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the projection operator.

Wait, let's go back. The projection operator for eigenvalue 0 is \( \text{Proj} = |v\rangle \langle v| \), where \( |v\rangle \) is the normalized eigenvector \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Therefore, the probability is \( \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \)

Let me compute \( \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle \):

First, \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \)

So, \( |v\rangle \langle v| \) is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Now, multiply this by \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \):

\[ \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 \\ 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 \\ (-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -1 -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 + 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \text{Proj} | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Compute the dot product:

\[ (-1)*(-1) + 2*0 + 1*1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \]

So, the probability is 2.

But wait, the state vector \( \psi \) has a norm squared of 6, so probabilities should be between 0 and 1. So, I must have made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize the state first before computing the expectation value.

So, let me normalize \( \psi \):

\( \psi_{normalized} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Then, compute \( \langle \psi_{normalized} | \text{Proj} | \psi_{normalized} \rangle \)

First, compute \( \text{Proj} | \psi_{normalized} \rangle \):

\[ \text{Proj} | \psi_{normalized} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix} \]

Compute each component:

First component: \( 1*(-1/\sqrt{6}) + 0*(2/\sqrt{6}) + (-1)*(1/\sqrt{6}) = (-1 -1)/\sqrt{6} = -2/\sqrt{6} \)

Second component: 0

Third component: \( (-1)*(-1/\sqrt{6}) + 0*(2/\sqrt{6}) + 1*(1/\sqrt{6}) = (1 +1)/\sqrt{6} = 2/\sqrt{6} \)

So, \( \text{Proj} | \psi_{normalized} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -2/\sqrt{6} \\ 0 \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix} \)

Now, compute \( \langle \psi_{normalized} | \text{Proj} | \psi_{normalized} \rangle \):

\[ \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} & 2/\sqrt{6} & 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix} \]

Compute the dot product:

\[ (-1/\sqrt{6})(-1/\sqrt{6}) + (2/\sqrt{6})(0) + (1/\sqrt{6})(1/\sqrt{6}) = (1/6) + 0 + (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3 \]

So, the probability is 1/3.

But the correct answer is supposed to be 1. Clearly, I'm getting 1/3, which contradicts the given answer. So, I must have an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the projection operator. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is diagonal in a certain basis, and the measurement probability is computed differently.

Wait, let me reconsider. The observable P is represented by the given matrix, and the state is given as a vector. The observable's eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1, as I found earlier.

So, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. The probabilities are the squared inner products with the corresponding eigenvectors.

But in this case, the eigenvector for 0 is \( v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \) (normalized by 1/sqrt(2)).

So, when calculating the probability of measuring 0, it's the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and this eigenvector, divided by the norm of the state if it's not normalized.

So, compute \( |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 / ||\psi||^2 \)

Compute \( \langle v | \psi \rangle = [1 \quad 0 \quad -1] \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2 \)

So, \( |\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 \)

The norm squared of \( \psi \) is 6, so the probability is \( 4/6 = 2/3 \)

Wait, that's different from earlier. But still, it's not 1. So, something must be wrong.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the system is in an eigenstate of P?

Let me check if \( \psi \) is an eigenvector of P.

Compute \( P \psi \):

\( P \psi = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)

Compute each component:

First component: \( 0*(-1) + (1/\sqrt{2})*2 + 0*1 = 2/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} \)

Second component: \( (1/\sqrt{2})*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/\sqrt{2})*1 = (-1 + 1)/\sqrt{2} = 0 \)

Third component: \( 0*(-1) + (1/\sqrt{2})*2 + 0*1 = 2/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} \)

So, \( P \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \)

Compare this with \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). It's not a scalar multiple, so \( \psi \) isn't an eigenvector of P. So, the measurement outcome isn't necessarily 0.

Wait a minute, but when I computed \( P \psi \), the second component is 0. Maybe that's a clue.

Wait, the second component is 0, which is the eigenvalue. So, if I have \( P \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \), then the second component is 0. So, the expectation value of P is the sum of the components multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Wait, no, that's not how expectation values work.

Wait, the expectation value of P is \( \langle \psi | P | \psi \rangle \), not just reading off the components. Hmm.

But let me compute the expectation value to check.

Compute \( \langle \psi | P | \psi \rangle \):

First, \( P \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \) as above.

Then, \( \langle \psi | P | \psi \rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ \sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} = (-1)*\sqrt{2} + 2*0 + 1*\sqrt{2} = (-\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}) = 0 \)

So, the expectation value is 0. Interesting. But expectation value being 0 doesn't mean the probability of measuring 0 is 1. It just means that the average outcome is 0.

So, perhaps the probabilities are spread over the eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, but the average is 0.

But in the initial problem, we are only asked for the probability of measuring 0, which we computed earlier as either 1/3 or 2/3, depending on normalization. But the correct answer is 1, according to the user. So, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I misapplied the projection. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is actually the projection operator onto some subspace, but as given, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me check: P is idempotent?

Compute \( P^2 \):

First row: \( 0*0 + (1/\sqrt{2})(1/\sqrt{2}) + 0*0 = 1/2 \), rest are similar.

Wait, let me compute each element.

Compute \( P^2 \):

Element (1,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Element (1,2): 0*1/√2 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1/√2 = 0

Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Similarly,

Element (2,1): 1/√2 *0 + 0*1/√2 + 1/√2 *0 = 0

Element (2,2): 1/√2 *1/√2 + 0*0 +1/√2 *1/√2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Element (2,3): 1/√2 *0 + 0*1/√2 +1/√2 *0 = 0

Element (3,1): 0*0 +1/√2 *1/√2 +0*0=1/2

Element (3,2):0*1/√2 +1/√2 *0 +0*1/√2=0

Element (3,3): 0*0 +1/√2 *1/√2 +0*0=1/2

So, \( P^2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix} \)

Which is not equal to P, so P is not idempotent, meaning it's not a projection operator. So, my earlier assumption that the projection operator is rank-1 is incorrect.

Therefore, P is not a projection operator, so my previous approach was wrong.

Wait, but in the initial step, I thought that P is the observable, so it's a Hermitian matrix, which it is, since it's symmetric with real entries. So, P is a Hermitian matrix, so it has real eigenvalues, which I found: 0,1,-1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is the squared modulus of the component of the state in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but since P is not a projection operator, it's not idempotent, so my earlier approach using projection might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the spectral decomposition of P.

Given that P has eigenvalues 0,1,-1, and we found the eigenvectors.

We have for λ=0, eigenvector v1= [1,0,-1]^T

For λ=1, let's find the eigenvector.

Solve (P - I)x = 0:

First row: -1 x1 + (1/√2)x2 +0x3 =0

Second row: (1/√2)x1 -1 x2 + (1/√2)x3 =0

Third row: 0x1 + (1/√2)x2 -1x3=0

From first equation: -x1 + (1/√2)x2 =0 => x1 = (1/√2) x2

From third equation: (1/√2)x2 -x3 =0 => x3 = (1/√2)x2

From second equation: (1/√2)x1 -x2 + (1/√2)x3 =0

Substitute x1 and x3:

(1/√2)(1/√2 x2) -x2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 x2) = (1/2 x2) -x2 + (1/2 x2) = (1/2 -1 +1/2) x2 = (-0)x2=0

So, it's consistent.

Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form x2*[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T

Let me choose x2=√2 to make it integer:

x = √2 [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T = [1, √2, 1]^T

Similarly, for λ=-1, eigenvector.

Solve (P + I)x =0:

First row: x1 + (1/√2)x2 +0x3 =0

Second row: (1/√2)x1 +x2 + (1/√2)x3 =0

Third row:0x1 + (1/√2)x2 +x3=0

From first equation: x1 = - (1/√2) x2

From third equation: (1/√2)x2 + x3 =0 => x3 = - (1/√2) x2

From second equation: (1/√2)x1 +x2 + (1/√2)x3 = (1/√2)(-1/√2 x2) +x2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 x2 ) = (-1/2 x2) +x2 + (-1/2 x2 )=0

Consistent.

Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=-1 are of the form x2*[ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T

Again, choose x2=√2 to make it integer:

x= √2 [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T = [-1, √2, -1]^T

So, now, we have three eigenvectors:

v0 = [1,0,-1]^T (for λ=0)

v1 = [1, √2, 1]^T (for λ=1)

v-1 = [-1, √2, -1]^T (for λ=-1)

We should check if these eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Compute v0 ⋅ v1: 1*1 + 0*√2 + (-1)*1 =1 +0 -1=0

v0 ⋅ v-1:1*(-1) +0*√2 + (-1)*(-1) =-1 +0 +1=0

v1 ⋅ v-1:1*(-1) + √2*√2 +1*(-1) =-1 +2 -1=0

So, they are mutually orthogonal. Therefore, we can form an orthonormal basis with these eigenvectors.

First, normalize each eigenvector.

Compute ||v0||: sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So, normalized u0= v0 / sqrt(2)= [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)]^T

Compute ||v1||: sqrt(1^2 + (√2)^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(1 +2 +1)=sqrt(4)=2. So, normalized u1= v1 /2= [1/2, √2/2, 1/2]^T

Similarly, ||v-1||: same as v1, since it's symmetric. So, normalized u-1= v-1 /2= [-1/2, √2/2, -1/2]^T

Now, the spectral decomposition of P is:

P = 0 * u0 u0^T + 1 * u1 u1^T + (-1) * u-1 u-1^T

So, to compute the probability of measuring 0, which is the square of the norm of the component of ψ in u0.

Given state ψ = [-1,2,1]^T

Compute the coefficient c0 = ⟨u0 | ψ⟩

u0 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T

So,

c0 = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Therefore, |c0|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2

But since the state ψ is not normalized, the norm squared is 6, so the probability is |c0|^2 / ||ψ||^2 = 2/6 = 1/3

Again, same result. So, probability is 1/3, not 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is not represented by the matrix I thought. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says: "An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ sqrt{2}, 0), in the second row as (1/ sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ sqrt{2}, 0)."

So, P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So, yes, correct as I thought.

Wait, maybe the state is a row vector, not column? But the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix". So, it's a column vector, as I took.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the observable P has rank 1, so only the eigenvalue 0 has a non-trivial eigenspace, and the other eigenvalues are 1 and -1 with multiplicity 1 each.

But in our calculation, we found that the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional, same for 1 and -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a state that is entirely in the eigenspace of 0, so the probability is 1. But in our case, the state ψ is not in the eigenspace of 0, because when I multiplied P with ψ, I got [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T, which is not a scalar multiple of ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvectors.

Wait, let me re-examine the eigenvectors.

For λ=0, we had:

From first equation: x2=0

From third equation: x3 = -x1

So, eigenvectors are [x1, 0, -x1]^T, which is correct.

Wait, but when I calculated the inner product with ψ, I got c0= -sqrt(2), so |c0|^2=2.

But if ψ were in the eigenspace, then Pψ would be 0, but it's not, as we saw.

Wait, maybe the state is expressed in the basis of eigenvectors. If so, then the probability would be 1 for some eigenvalue.

But given that ψ is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is not aligned with any eigenvectors.

Wait, let me check if the state is orthogonal to the eigenspace.

Wait, no. The inner product was non-zero, so it's not
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem where the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). There's an observable represented by the matrix operator P, which has specific elements. The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t, and it's mentioned that the correct answer is 1. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me recall some quantum mechanics concepts. In quantum theory, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. When you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with each eigenstate.

So, to find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue (in this case, 0), I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator P. Then, I can see if the given state is in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. If it is, then the probability is 1; otherwise, it's the square of the projection onto that eigenspace.

Let me write down the matrix P first:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
      [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
      [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, so this is a 3x3 matrix. Let me check if it's Hermitian. Since all the elements are real, I just need to check if P equals its transpose. Looking at P, the (1,2) element is 1/√2 and the (2,1) element is also 1/√2, same for (2,3) and (3,2). The diagonal elements are 0, so P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. Good, so it's a valid observable.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let's start by finding the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, let's write down P - λI:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * det([[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]]) - (1/√2) * det([[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]) + 0 * something.

Wait, no, actually, expanding along the first row might be easier.

So, determinant = -λ * det([[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]]) - (1/√2) * det([[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]) + 0 * det(...).

Let's compute each minor.

First minor: det([[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2.

Second minor: det([[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]) = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2.

So, the determinant is:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) + 0.

Simplify this:

-λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So, the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Let me write that as λ³ - λ = 0.

Factoring, λ(λ² - 1) = 0.

So, the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables should have real eigenvalues, which they do here. So, the possible outcomes are -1, 0, and 1.

But the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 and see if the given state is in that eigenspace.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0. So, we solve (P - 0I)|v> = 0, i.e., P|v> = 0.

So, the system is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0

So, equations:

1) (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

2) (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

3) (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, from equation 1 and 3, v2 = 0.

From equation 2: v1 = -v3.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, because if v2 = 0 and v1 = -v3, then the vector is (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number. So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional with basis vector (1, 0, -1).

Now, the given state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let me write this vector down.

Is this vector in the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0? To check, let's see if |ψ> can be expressed as a scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1).

So, let's see: (-1, 2, 1) = a*(1, 0, -1). That would require:

-1 = a*1 => a = -1

2 = a*0 => 2 = 0, which is not true.

So, |ψ> is not in the eigenspace of λ=0.

Wait, but the probability of measuring 0 is supposed to be 1. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the eigenvectors. Let me re-examine.

Wait, let me check the eigenvectors again.

We had for λ=0:

Equation 1: (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2=0

Equation 2: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 =0 => v1 + v3=0

Equation 3: same as equation 1, v2=0.

So, from these, as before, v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvectors are (a, 0, -a), so the basis is (1, 0, -1). So, indeed, the state vector (-1, 2, 1) is not a multiple of this.

Wait a second, perhaps I should calculate the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of λ=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is given by the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector divided by the norm squared of the eigenvector.

Let me denote the eigenvector as |e> = (1, 0, -1)^T.

Compute the inner product <e|ψ>:

(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

The norm squared of |e> is 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

So, the projection is (-2)/2 = -1. The probability is the square of the absolute value, so | -1 |² = 1.

Wait, so the probability is 1? But that would mean the state is entirely in the eigenspace of λ=0, but earlier I thought it wasn't.

Wait, no, the projection is -1, but the state is not a multiple of |e>, but when you take the inner product, you get a complex number whose magnitude squared is the probability.

But in this case, the inner product is -1, whose magnitude is 1, so the probability is 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, even though |ψ> is not a scalar multiple of |e>, when you take the inner product, it's -1, which gives a probability of 1. That seems counterintuitive because I thought the state wasn't in the eigenspace.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inner product. Let me recompute:

<e|ψ> = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, |e> is (1, 0, -1). So, <e|ψ> is 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 -1 = -2.

Wait, but the norm of |e> is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Ah! So, maybe I forgot to normalize the eigenvector. That's a crucial step.

So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with basis |e> = (1, 0, -1). The normalized eigenvector is |e_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Then, the inner product <e_normalized|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Then, the probability is |<e_normalized|ψ>|² = | -sqrt(2) |² = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization. Let me re-examine.

The eigenvector |e> is (1, 0, -1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

But the given state |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the inner product:

<e_normalized|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Then, the probability is | -sqrt(2) |² = (sqrt(2))² = 2. But that can't be, because probabilities can't be more than 1.

Wait, that suggests that something is wrong. Maybe my calculation is incorrect, or perhaps the state is being considered as a density matrix?

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector, but here the given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if it's normalized.

Compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, norm is sqrt(6). So, it's not normalized. Hmm, that's another issue.

Wait, so perhaps I need to normalize the state first before computing probabilities. Because in quantum mechanics, the state should be a unit vector.

So, |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Then, the inner product with the normalized eigenvector |e_normalized> is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Simplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

Then, the probability is | (-1)/sqrt(3) |² = (1/3).

Wait, so that would give a probability of 1/3, not 1. But the correct answer is supposed to be 1. Hmm, now I'm more confused.

Wait, so perhaps I've messed up the entire approach. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is a projection operator. Because it's called an observable, but the name P suggests it could be a projection. Let me check if P is idempotent, i.e., P² = P.

Compute P²:

First row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2)

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2)

Wait, that's just the first row multiplied by P.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I should compute P squared properly.

Wait, matrix multiplication: (P²)_{i,j} = sum_k P_{i,k} P_{k,j}

Let me compute each element:

First row:

(1,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2

(1,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

(1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2

Second row:

(2,1): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

(2,2): (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

(2,3): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Third row:

(3,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2

(3,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

(3,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2

So, P² is:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

[0, 1, 0]

[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Wait, so P² is not equal to P. For example, the (1,1) element is 1/2 vs. 0 in P, so P² ≠ P. So, P is not a projection operator. So, it's not projecting onto an eigenspace, but just a regular observable with eigenvalues -1, 0, and 1.

Wait, so going back, I think I need to compute the probability correctly.

Given that |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1), which is not normalized. So, first, let me normalize it.

Compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Then, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0.

Earlier, we found that eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), which is normalized to (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Compute the inner product:

< e | ψ_normalized > = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3)

Then, the probability is | (-1)/sqrt(3) |² = 1/3.

Hmm, so that gives 1/3, which is approximately 0.333. But the correct answer is supposed to be 1, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the operator P. Maybe P is not the observable itself, but rather the projection onto the eigenspace. But earlier, we saw that P² ≠ P, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the observable as having possible outcomes 0, 1, -1, and if the state is in the eigenspace of 0, then the probability is 1. But our state is not in that eigenspace, so the probability shouldn't be 1.

Wait, unless the operator P is actually representing something else. Maybe it's a Pauli matrix or something similar? Let me check the trace and determinant.

Trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Determinant earlier was found as det(P) = ... wait, the determinant of P? Let me compute it.

det(P) = 0*(0*0 - 0*(1/√2)) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)*0 - 0*(1/√2) ) + 0*( (1/√2)*(1/√2) - 0*0 )

Simplify:

= 0 - (1/√2)*(0 - 0) + 0 = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0.

So, determinant is 0. Hmm, so P is a singular matrix, which makes sense because its eigenvalues include 0.

Wait, perhaps the operator P has rank 2, since the determinant is 0 and trace is 0.

Wait, but regardless, I think my earlier computation is correct. The probability should be 1/3, unless I messed up the normalization.

Wait, let me check the inner product again.

The normalized eigenvector |e> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), and the normalized state |ψ> is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So, the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So, the absolute value squared is 1/3.

So, that's the probability. So, why is the correct answer 1? Maybe I misunderstood the observable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observable is not P itself, but something else. Wait, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are -1, 0, 1.

But in the initial problem, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). Wait, perhaps the state is not a unit vector, but it's being considered as a density matrix? Wait, no, it's given as a column matrix, so it's a state vector.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the operator P is the position operator or something, but no, in the problem statement, it's given as an observable.

Wait, maybe because P squared is (1/2, 0, 1/2) in the first row, etc., which is not equal to P. So, it's not a projection operator.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the observable P only takes 0 as an outcome, but that contradicts the eigenvalues we found.

Wait, maybe the matrix P is rank 1, so the only non-zero eigenvalue is 1, but determinant is 0, so no, rank is 2, because trace is 0, determinant is 0, so rank 2.

Wait, if the operator is rank 2, then the dimension of the eigenspace for λ=0 is 1, as we saw. So, unless the state is in that eigenspace, the probability won't be 1.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the state is not in that eigenspace, so the probability is 1/3. But the correct answer is 1.

Is there a chance that I messed up the eigenvector for λ=0?

Wait, let's go back. For λ=0, we have the equations:

(1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2=0

(1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

(1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2=0

So, the solutions are v1 = -v3, v2=0, which gives vectors (a, 0, -a). So, that seems correct.

So, the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional.

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation in the eigenvalues. Earlier, we had the characteristic equation:

det(P - λI) = -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(λ² - 1) = 0 => λ = 0, ±1.

So that's correct. So, eigenvalues are -1, 0, 1.

Wait, maybe the operator has repeated eigenvalues, but no, it's a 3x3 matrix with three distinct eigenvalues.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the operator P is being confused with another operator. Wait, let me check the matrix P:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, maybe it's similar to a Pauli matrix or something else. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize P to find its spectral decomposition.

Alternatively, since I have the eigenvalues, maybe I can find the eigenvectors and see.

Wait, for λ=1, find the eigenvectors.

So, solve (P - I)|v> = 0.

So, matrix:

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -1 ]

So, equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

So, let me substitute v1 = (1/√2) v2 and v3 = (1/√2) v2 into the second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) = (1/2)v2 - v2 + (1/2)v2 = (1/2 -1 +1/2)v2 = (-0)v2 = 0.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are all vectors of the form (1/√2 v2, v2, 1/√2 v2 ) = v2*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)/sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)/sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, let me compute the norm squared of (1/√2, 1, 1/√2):

(1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. So, norm is sqrt(2). So, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, no, actually, 1/√2 divided by sqrt(2) is (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1/2. Similarly, 1 divided by sqrt(2) is 1/sqrt(2). So, yes, (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Similarly, for λ=-1, solve (P + I)|v> = 0.

Matrix:

[1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 1 ]

Equations:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2) v2

(1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2 v2) = (-1/2)v2 + v2 + (-1/2)v2 = (-1/2 +1 -1/2)v2 = 0*v2 = 0.

So, eigenvectors for λ=-1 are (-1/√2 v2, v2, -1/√2 v2 ) = v2*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2). The norm is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2), so normalized eigenvector is (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2)/sqrt(2) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

So, now, we have three orthonormal eigenvectors:

For λ=0: (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

For λ=1: (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

For λ=-1: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

Now, the given state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1). Let's express |ψ> in terms of these orthonormal eigenvectors.

So, |ψ> = a|e0> + b|e1> + c|e-1>, where |e0> is the eigenvector for λ=0, |e1> for λ=1, and |e-1> for λ=-1.

Compute coefficients a, b, c as the inner products:

a = <e0|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Similarly, b = <e1|ψ> = (1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + 2/sqrt(2) + 1/2 = (-1/2 + 1/2) + 2/sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2)

Similarly, c = <e-1|ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + 2/sqrt(2) + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + 2/sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2)

Wait, so |ψ> is expressed as:

|ψ> = (-sqrt(2))|e0> + (2*sqrt(2))|e1> + (2*sqrt(2))|e-1>

But wait, |ψ> is not a unit vector. Because if we compute the norm squared:

|a|² + |b|² + |c|² = (sqrt(2))² + (2*sqrt(2))² + (2*sqrt(2))² = 2 + 8 + 8 = 18.

But the norm squared of |ψ> is 6, as computed earlier. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, no, actually, because the inner products are in terms of the original basis, not the normalized eigenvectors. Wait, no, the coefficients a, b, c should be computed correctly.

Wait, no, actually, |e0>, |e1>, |e-1> are orthonormal, but |ψ> is not normalized. So, the sum of squares of |a|, |b|, |c| gives the squared norm of |ψ>, which is 18, but in reality, |ψ> has squared norm 6.

So, something's wrong in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the inner products. Let me recompute b and c.

Compute b = <e1|ψ>:

|e1> = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2). So, <e1|ψ> = (1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (1/2)*1.

Compute each term:

(1/2)*(-1) = -1/2

(1/sqrt(2))*2 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

(1/2)*1 = 1/2

So, total: (-1/2) + sqrt(2) + (1/2) = ( -1/2 +1/2 ) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Similarly, c = <e-1|ψ>:

|e-1> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, <e-1|ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (-1/2)*1.

Compute each term:

(-1/2)*(-1) = 1/2

(1/sqrt(2))*2 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

(-1/2)*1 = -1/2

Total: 1/2 + sqrt(2) -1/2 = (1/2 -1/2) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

So, correct coefficients:

a = -sqrt(2)

b = sqrt(2)

c = sqrt(2)

So, |ψ> = -sqrt(2)|e0> + sqrt(2)|e1> + sqrt(2)|e-1>

Compute the norm squared:

|a|² + |b|² + |c|² = (2) + (2) + (2) = 6. Correct, because |ψ> has norm sqrt(6).

So, now, the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|² divided by the norm squared.

So, probability of measuring 0 is |a|² / 6 = 2 /6 = 1/3.

Probability of measuring 1 is |b|² /6 = 2/6 = 1/3.

Probability of measuring -1 is |c|² /6 = 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, so all three probabilities are equal: 1/3 each.

But the problem states that the correct answer is 1, so I must have gone wrong somewhere.

Wait, unless the operator P is being interpreted differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the operator P is rank 1, and only 0 and 1 are possible outcomes, but that contradicts the earlier eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the matrix P. Let me check the original problem.

"the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0)."

Yes, so it's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's a tensor product or something else. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the state is written as a row vector instead of column vector. Wait, the state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So, it's a column vector.

Wait, perhaps I should compute P|ψ> and see.

Compute P|ψ>:

P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1):

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1)/√2 + 1/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

So, P|ψ> = (sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)).

Hmm, interesting. So, P|ψ> is a vector with second component 0.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, if you apply the observable operator to the state, you get a vector whose components are the eigenvalues times the coefficients, but that's only if the state is an eigenstate. Otherwise, it's a superposition.

Wait, actually, in this case, we have the spectral decomposition, so P|ψ> is equal to sum λ |e_λ> <e_λ|ψ>.

Which, in our case, is 0 * |e0> <e0|
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield 0. The system's state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, okay. Let me recall what I know about observables and quantum mechanics.

First, in quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix. The possible outcomes of a measurement of this observable are the eigenvalues of the matrix, and the probability of each outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state of the system.

So, to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P.
2. Identify the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.
3. Compute the inner product between the system's state and this eigenvector.
4. The probability will be the square of the absolute value of this inner product.

Alright, let's start with the matrix P. It's given as:

First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Let me write this out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To do this, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix P - λI:

[ [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
  [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
  [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ] ]

Now, compute the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. I think expansion by minors might be better here.

So, expanding along the first row:

-λ * det( [ [ -λ, 1/√2 ], [1/√2, -λ ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2 ], [0, -λ ] ] ) + 0 * det(...)

So, let's compute each of these minors.

First minor (top-left 2x2 determinant):

det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2)

Second minor (top-middle 2x2 determinant):

det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]) = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

Third minor is multiplied by 0, so it doesn't contribute.

Therefore, the determinant is:

-λ * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) + 0

Simplify term by term:

First term: -λ(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/2

So, combining these:

-λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor out λ:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, solutions are λ = 0, and -λ² + 1 = 0 ⇒ λ² = 1 ⇒ λ = ±1

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, the possible outcomes of measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

Now, since the question is about the probability of getting 0, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0 and compute the projection onto this eigenvector.

Let's find the eigenvector for λ = 0. So, we solve (P - 0I)v = Pv = 0.

So, the system is:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0
2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0
3. (1/√2) v2 = 0

From equation 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

From equation 3: same as equation 1, so v2 = 0

From equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3

So, the eigenvector can be written as v = (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. Let me choose v3 = t, so v1 = -t. Therefore, the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1). To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

Compute the norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the unit eigenvector is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ).

So, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ).

Now, the system's state is given as the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this state as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

To find the probability of measuring 0, we compute the inner product <v|ψ>, where |v> is the unit eigenvector for 0, which is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 )^T.

Compute the inner product:

< v | ψ > = (-1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (1/√2)(1) = (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2

Wait, hold on, that gives me √2. But probabilities are supposed to be between 0 and 1. Hmm, that suggests a problem because √2 squared is 2, which is greater than 1. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in normalizing the eigenvector or in the inner product.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvector. The eigenvector is ( -1, 0, 1 ), right? Then normalized, it's ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ). So, that's correct.

Then, the inner product with |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) is:

(-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2.

Wait, that's correct, but the inner product is √2, which is greater than 1, which seems impossible because the inner product's magnitude squared is the probability, which can't exceed 1.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the eigenvector. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I solved for the eigenvector with λ=0, I had the equations:

(1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3

So, the eigenvector is (v1, 0, v3) = (-v3, 0, v3). Choosing v3 = 1, gives ( -1, 0, 1 ). Then, normalized, it is ( -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ), which is correct.

So, why does the inner product with |ψ> give √2? That's a problem because probabilities can't exceed 1. Maybe I'm not taking into account that the state is not normalized?

Wait, hold on. The system's state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is this a unit vector? Let's check its norm.

Compute ||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So, the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. Therefore, to get probabilities, we need to normalize the state first.

Alternatively, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state is assumed to be normalized. So, perhaps in the setup, the state is given as a non-normalized vector? Or maybe in this question, it's given as a non-normalized vector, but we need to normalize it before computing probabilities.

Wait, the question says: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." It doesn't specify whether it's normalized. So, perhaps we need to normalize it first.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the probability without normalizing, but then probabilities will be scaled by the norm.

Wait, let me think.

In quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to be a unit vector. If it's not, then it's called a ket vector, and you can normalize it by dividing by its norm.

So, the state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, with norm sqrt(6). So, the unit vector is |ψ_normalized> = (1/√6)|ψ>.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is |<v|ψ_normalized>|².

Compute <v|ψ_normalized>:

= (1/√6) <v|ψ>

= (1/√6) * √2

= √2 / √6

= (√2)/(√6) = (√2)/(√2*√3) = 1/√3

Therefore, the probability is |1/√3|² = 1/3.

Wait, that's 1/3, but the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that contradicts. So, either I made a mistake in my calculations, or perhaps the state was supposed to be normalized, or maybe I got the eigenvector wrong.

Wait, let me check the eigenvalue calculation again.

We had P as:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

We set up the equation (P - λI)v = 0.

For λ = 0, we had:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0
2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3
3. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

So, eigenvector is (v1, 0, v3) = (-v3, 0, v3). So, if I let v3 = a, then eigenvector is (-a, 0, a). So, normalized, it is (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2).

So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the state vector is being considered as a row vector? Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is a column vector, and the inner product is conjugate transpose times the vector.

But in our case, the state is a column vector, and the eigenvector is also a column vector, so the inner product is just the standard dot product, since all elements are real.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again:

< v | ψ > = (-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1

= (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2)

= 2/√2 = √2

But |ψ> is not normalized. So, to get the correct probability, we have to normalize both vectors.

Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||² only if |v> is not a unit vector.

Wait, no, |v> is a unit vector, since it's an eigenvector. So, the probability should be |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, let me refer to the formula.

In quantum mechanics, the probability P of measuring a particular eigenvalue λ is equal to |<v|ψ>|², where |v> is the unit eigenvector corresponding to λ, and |ψ> is the state vector.

But if |ψ> is not normalized, then you have to normalize it first.

Wait, actually, no. If |ψ> is not a unit vector, then the probability is |<v|ψ>|² divided by the norm of |ψ> squared.

Wait, let me recall: the state is a vector in a Hilbert space, which may not be normalized. The probability is then |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

But in standard QM, the state is assumed to be normalized, so ||ψ|| = 1.

In this problem, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

Therefore, the probability is |<v|ψ_normalized>|².

So, compute <v|ψ_normalized>:

= [ (-1/√2), 0, (1/√2) ] • [ (-1)/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]

= (-1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (1/√2)(1/√6)

= (1)/(√2√6) + 0 + (1)/(√2√6)

= 2/(√12) = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3

Therefore, the probability is |1/√3|² = 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the state is already normalized, but in this case, sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So, it's not normalized.

Alternatively, maybe the observable is defined such that P is a projection operator, and hence the probability is just the square of the norm of the component in the eigenspace.

Wait, looking back at the matrix P, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me check if it's a projection operator.

A projection operator P should satisfy P² = P. Let me check if that's the case here.

Compute P²:

First row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0]. Multiplying by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2)
Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0
Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Wait, that can't be, let's compute P squared properly.

Wait, actually, to compute P squared, we have to perform matrix multiplication.

Let me compute P squared step by step.

P = [ [0, a, 0],
       [a, 0, a],
       [0, a, 0] ] where a = 1/√2.

Compute P squared:

Element (1,1): Row 1 of P times Column 1 of P:

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2

Element (1,2): Row 1 of P times Column 2 of P:

0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0

Element (1,3): Row 1 of P times Column 3 of P:

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2

Element (2,1): Row 2 of P times Column 1 of P:

a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0

Element (2,2): Row 2 of P times Column 2 of P:

a*a + 0*0 + a*a = 2a² = 1

Element (2,3): Row 2 of P times Column 3 of P:

a*0 + 0*a + a*0 = 0

Element (3,1): Row 3 of P times Column 1 of P:

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2

Element (3,2): Row 3 of P times Column 2 of P:

0*a + a*0 + 0*a = 0

Element (3,3): Row 3 of P times Column 3 of P:

0*0 + a*a + 0*0 = a² = 1/2

So, P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Which is not equal to P. Therefore, P is not a projection operator, so my initial thought was wrong.

Therefore, my initial approach is correct: finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

Wait, but then I get the probability as 1/3, which is about 0.333, but the user said the correct answer is 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvector is different.

Wait, let me check if P has another eigenvector for λ=0 or if I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, from the characteristic equation, we had eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. So, only one eigenvector for λ=0.

Alternatively, maybe the state is in the eigenspace of P for λ=0, making the probability 1.

Wait, let me compute |ψ> in terms of the eigenvectors.

Compute the component of |ψ> in the eigenspace for λ=0.

But since the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional (as the algebraic multiplicity is 1, since the characteristic equation was λ(-λ² +1 )=0, so geometric multiplicity is 1), so the component is just the projection onto the eigenvector.

But we saw that the projection is √2, but since the state is not normalized, the probability is (√2)^2 / ||ψ||^2 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1, so perhaps they are saying that the probability is 100%, which would mean that the state is in the eigenspace of P for λ=0.

But wait, if I compute the inner product squared, it's 2, which is more than 1, so that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation of the inner product.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again, but this time considering that the eigenvector is a column vector and the state is a column vector.

Wait, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of the eigenvector times the state vector.

But since all elements are real, it's just the dot product.

So, eigenvector v is [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]^T.

State ψ is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So, inner product is:

(-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (1)/√2 + 0 + (1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2.

So, that's correct.

But as we saw, the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), so the norm squared is 6.

Therefore, the probability is (sqrt(2))^2 / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

So, 1/3 is the probability, not 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1, so I must have made a mistake in the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is defined differently. Maybe P is an observable but not Hermitian. But P is given as:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Which is symmetric, so it's Hermitian, so that's correct.

Wait, another approach: compute P|ψ> and see if it's an eigenvector.

Compute P|ψ>:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1)/√2 + 1/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

So, P|ψ> = [ √2, 0, √2 ]^T.

Compare this with λ|ψ> for some λ.

But [ √2, 0, √2 ]^T is not a scalar multiple of |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So, unless |ψ> is in the eigenspace, which it's not, then the measurement outcome isn't necessarily 0.

Wait, but if P|ψ> is [ √2, 0, √2 ]^T, which is not a multiple of |ψ>, so |ψ> is not an eigenvector, so the measurement can give different eigenvalues.

But the probability of measuring 0 is determined by the component of |ψ> in the eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0, which is 1/3, as we found earlier.

Wait, unless I messed up the projection.

Wait, no, the projection is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||² if |v> is unit. Wait, no, the formula is |<v|ψ>|² divided by ||ψ||² if |ψ> is not normalized.

But actually, in QM, the formula is |<v|ψ>|², where |ψ> is a unit vector. If |ψ> is not a unit vector, then the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, I think that's where I went wrong earlier.

Wait, no, actually, in QM, the state vector is supposed to be normalized, so |ψ> is a unit vector. If it's given as not normalized, then you have to normalize it first.

Therefore, if |ψ> is not normalized, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

But in our case, |v> is a unit vector, and |ψ> is not, so the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, hold on. Let me recall: the probability is |<v|ψ>|², assuming |ψ> is a unit vector. If |ψ> is not a unit vector, then the probability is |<v|ψ_normalized>|², where |ψ_normalized> = |ψ> / ||ψ||.

But in that case, <v|ψ_normalized> = <v|ψ> / ||ψ||.

So, probability is |<v|ψ> / ||ψ|||² = |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Therefore, in our case, |<v|ψ>|² is (√2)^2 = 2, and ||ψ||² is 6. So, probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Therefore, 1/3 is the probability.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So, that suggests that perhaps the state is in the eigenspace, but as we saw, |ψ> is not in the eigenspace for λ=0 because P|ψ> ≠ 0|ψ>.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the eigenvector. Wait, let me check the eigenvector again.

For λ=0, the equations were:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2=0

2. (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 = -v3

3. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2=0

So, v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3. So, the eigenvector is (v1, 0, v3) = (-v3, 0, v3). So, setting v3 =1, we get (-1,0,1). So, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). No, that would be for v1=1, v3=-1, which is the same as (-1,0,1) scaled by -1. So, same eigenspace.

Wait, maybe the eigenvector is different.

Wait, actually, in the case of degenerate eigenvalues or when there are multiple eigenvectors, but no, for λ=0, we have only one eigenvector.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the inner product. Let me write it down again.

Eigenvector v: [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]^T

State ψ: [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T

Inner product: (-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (1)/√2 + 0 + (1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2.

So, that's correct.

But since the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), the normalized inner product is √2 / sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 1/sqrt(3). Therefore, the probability is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

Hmm, maybe the user is wrong in saying the correct answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the observable P is such that P² = P, but we saw that it's not. So, it's not a projection operator, so the probability isn't just the square of the component.

Alternatively, maybe the state is being interpreted as a density matrix? But no, the state is given as a column vector, so it's a pure state.

Alternatively, perhaps the measurement is in the eigenbasis of P, and since P is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 0,1,-1, and the state is expressed in the standard basis, so we have to find the expansion in terms of the eigenbasis.

But that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of P, but that's not the question. The question is about the probability of measuring 0.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable is being considered as a matrix with eigenvalues only 0 and 1, but no, we have eigenvalues 0,1,-1.

Wait, but in the measurement, you can only get one of the eigenvalues, so 0,1, or -1.

But the probability of getting 0 is 1/3, as we computed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is different.

Wait, let me compute P squared in another way.

Wait, but no, I think the process is correct.

Wait, unless I miscalculated the eigenvalues.

Wait, original characteristic equation was:

-λ³ + λ = 0 ⇒ λ(-λ² +1 )=0 ⇒ λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So, eigenvalues are correct.

Alternatively, maybe instead of calculating the inner product, I should calculate something else.

Wait, hold on, another approach: compute P|ψ> and see if it's proportional to |ψ>.

But earlier, we saw that P|ψ> = [√2, 0, √2]^T, which is not a multiple of |ψ>, so |ψ> is not an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is wrong in saying the answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is different.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvector calculation.

For λ=0:

Equation 1: v2 =0.

Equation 3: v2=0.

Equation 2: v1 + v3 =0.

So, v1 = -v3.

Therefore, v = ( -v3, 0, v3 ) = v3*(-1, 0, 1 ).

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (-1, 0, 1 ). So, normalized, it's (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ). So, correct.

So, the inner product is indeed √2.

But since the state has norm sqrt(6), the probability is (√2)^2 /6= 2/6=1/3.

Alternatively, maybe the user thought that since P is symmetric, the probability is 1.

But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector.

Wait, let me consider that the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Then, normalized, it would be (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ). Then, inner product with ψ would be:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1)/√2 -1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

Then, the probability is (√2)^2=2, over 6, which is again 1/3.

So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I have the wrong eigenvector.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the eigenvector is orthogonal to the state, making the inner product zero, so probability zero.

But in our case, the inner product is √2, which is non-zero, so that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: Compute the angles between the vectors.

The state vector is (-1,2,1), and the eigenvector is (-1,0,1) scaled.

Compute the angle between them.

The cosine of the angle is equal to the inner product divided by the product of the norms.

So, inner product is √2.

Norm of state is sqrt(6).

Norm of eigenvector is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 +1^2 )=sqrt(2).

Therefore, cos(theta) = √2 / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = √2 / (sqrt(12)) = √2 / (2*sqrt(3)) = 1/√6.

Therefore, the angle is arccos(1/√6), which is approximately 75.5 degrees, not 0 or 180, so the probability is not 0 or 1.

So, probability is 1/3.

Hmm, maybe the user thought that because P is symmetric, and the state is symmetric in some way, the probability is 1, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is (1, sqrt(2),1), but no, that doesn't satisfy the equation.

Wait, maybe the eigenvector is different.

Wait, let me check the eigenvector again.

For λ=0:

From equation 2: v1 + v3 =0.

So, v1 = -v3.

Equations 1 and 3 only fix v2=0.

So, the eigenvector is ( -v3, 0, v3 ). So, setting v3=1, we get (-1,0,1). So, correct.

Wait, unless the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), but that's just the negative of it.

So, no difference in inner product magnitude.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I have to consider that the state is being projected into the eigenspace, but the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the projection is just the inner product.

But we did that.

Wait, unless I have to calculate the trace or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is correct, and the probability is 1, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, let me consider that P is a diagonalizable matrix, and the state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.

So, |ψ> = a|v0> + b|v1> + c|v-1>, where |v0>, |v1>, |v-1> are the unit eigenvectors for eigenvalues 0,1,-1.

Then, the probability of measuring 0 is |a|².

So, to find a, we have a = <v0|ψ>.

Which is the same as we computed earlier, which is √2, but normalized.

Wait, no, a is <v0|ψ>, which is √2, but if |ψ> is not normalized, then |a|² / ||ψ||² is the probability.

So, again, 2/6=1/3.

So, same result.

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, the user is mistaken in thinking the answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was about an expectation value, but no, it's about the probability.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the inner product.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again.

Eigenvector v: [ -1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]

State ψ: [ -1, 2, 1 ]

Dot product: (-1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (1)/√2 + 0 + (1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, unless the eigenvector is different, the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is (1,0,1), but that's not an eigenvector.

Wait, let me check.

If I take v = (1,0,1), then Pv would be:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 =0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 +0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (1/√2 + 1/√2)=√2

Third component:0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1=0

So, Pv = [0, √2, 0]^T, which is not a multiple of v=(1,0,1). Therefore, v=(1,0,1) is not an eigenvector.

Therefore, my initial eigenvector is correct.

Therefore, I think the probability is indeed 1/3, so the user is incorrect in stating the correct answer is 1.

Wait, unless there was a miscalculation in the norm.

Wait, the norm of the eigenvector is sqrt( (-1/√2)^2 +0 + (1/√2)^2 )=sqrt(1/2 +0 +1/2)=sqrt(1)=1, so it's correctly normalized.

The norm of the state is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6), so that's correct.

Therefore, the inner product is √2.

The probability is |√2|² /6=2/6=1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Hence, the correct answer is 1/3, not 1.

Therefore, the user is mistaken in thinking the answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the expectation value, which would be something else.

Compute the expectation value of P: <ψ|P|ψ
[overthinking]
Alright, so I need to figure out why the probability of measuring 0 for the observable P at time t is 1. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements.

First, let me write down the state vector. It's a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

And the observable P is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P first.

But wait, before jumping into that, maybe I should check if P is a projection operator or something else. Looking at the matrix P, I notice that it's a symmetric matrix, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Also, each element is either 0 or 1/√2. Let me sum up the elements in each row to see if it's a probability operator or something.

For the first row: 0 + 1/√2 + 0 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

Second row: 1/√2 + 0 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2 ≈ 1.414

Third row: 0 + 1/√2 + 0 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

Hmm, so the rows don't sum to 1 or anything like that. Maybe it's not a density matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's an observable, which it is, so it's represented by a Hermitian operator.

But since it's given as an observable, maybe I need to compute the expectation value, or rather, the probability distribution over its eigenvalues.

Okay, so to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue, then compute the squared modulus of the inner product between the state vector ψ and each eigenvector.

But before that, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of P. Let me try that.

So, the characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write out P - λI:

\[
P - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix}
-λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
\det(P - λI) = -λ \cdot \det \begin{bmatrix} -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ \end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \det \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & -λ \end{bmatrix} + 0 \cdot \det(...)
\]

So, expanding the determinant:

First term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] = -λ [ λ² - 1/2 ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) = - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) = (λ)/2

Third term is zero.

So total determinant:

-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Set equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, λ = 0 or λ² = 1 => λ = 1 or λ = -1

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Therefore, the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

We need the probability of measuring 0. So, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0, then compute |⟨ψ | v⟩|² where v is the eigenvector normalized.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for λ = 0.

Solving (P - 0 I) v = 0, so P v = 0.

So, writing the equations:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as row 1, so v2 = 0

So from row 1 and 3: v2 = 0. From row 2: v1 = -v3

So, the eigenvectors are of the form:

v = [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3.

Let me set v1 = a, so v3 = -a. So, the eigenvector is a*[1, 0, -1]

Thus, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√(1² + 0 + (-1)²)) * [1, 0, -1] = (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]

So, the eigenvector v corresponding to λ=0 is (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]

Now, the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

Compute the inner product ⟨ψ | v⟩:

⟨ψ | v⟩ = (-1)(1/√2) + 2*(0) + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The inner product is a scalar, but since v is a column vector, ⟨ψ | v⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ times v. Since all elements are real, it's just the dot product.

Wait, ψ is [-1, 2, 1], and v is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]

So, ⟨ψ | v⟩ = (-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Wait, that's not right because the inner product should be a scalar, but it's a real number. The modulus squared would be |⟨ψ | v⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2.

But that can't be, because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, that must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, let's check the normalization of ψ and v.

The state vector ψ is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me compute its norm:

||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

So, ψ is not normalized. Therefore, I should normalize it before computing probabilities.

Similarly, the eigenvector v is (1/√2)[1, 0, -1], so it's already normalized because (1/√2)^2*(1 + 0 + 1) = (1/2)*2 = 1.

So, ψ is not a unit vector. Therefore, before computing the inner product, I should normalize ψ.

Compute the normalized state vector:

ψ_normalized = ψ / ||ψ|| = (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]^T

So, ψ_normalized = [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]^T

Now, compute the inner product ⟨ψ_normalized | v⟩:

= (-1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/√2)

= (-1)/(√6√2) + 0 + (-1)/(√6√2)

= (-2)/(√12)

Simplify √12 = 2√3, so (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

Therefore, |⟨ψ_normalized | v⟩|² = ( -1/√3 )² = 1/3 ≈ 0.333

Wait, that's about 33.3%, but the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has 0 as an eigenvalue, and the probability is 1 because the state is in the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0?

Wait, let me check: if ψ is in the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0, then Pψ = 0, so the probability would be 1. Let me compute Pψ.

Compute Pψ:

First row: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

Second row: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0

Third row: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

So, Pψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T

But if ψ were an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, then Pψ would be 0. But it's not. So that's not the case.

But wait, maybe the state is in the eigenspace of some other observable? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's compute the probability again.

We found that the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is [1, 0, -1], normalized.

The normalized state is (1/√6)[-1, 2, 1]

So, the inner product is:

⟨ψ_normalized | v⟩ = [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ] ⋅ [1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ]

= (-1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/√2)

= (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12)

= (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3

So, the modulus squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333

So the probability is 1/3, not 1. But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe I misread the state vector. The state is (-1, 2, 1). Wait, is that a row vector or column vector? It says column matrix, so it's a column vector. So ψ is as I wrote.

Wait, let's check the observable P again. Maybe it's diagonal in some basis, or perhaps it's idempotent, meaning P^2 = P, which would make it a projection operator. Let's check P^2.

Compute P^2:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by P.

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Wait, no, actually, matrix multiplication is row times column.

Wait, let's compute P^2 step by step.

Compute element (1,1):

Row 1 of P: [0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by column 1 of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]^T

= 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Element (1,2):

Row 1 of P: [0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by column 2 of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T

= 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Element (1,3):

Row 1 of P multiplied by column 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]^T

= 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Similarly, element (2,1):

Row 2 of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2] multiplied by column 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]^T

= (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Element (2,2):

Row 2 multiplied by column 2:

= (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

Element (2,3):

Row 2 multiplied by column 3:

= (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Element (3,1):

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by column 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]^T

= 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Element (3,2):

Row 3 multiplied by column 2:

= 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Element (3,3):

Row 3 multiplied by column 3:

= 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, P^2 = 

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1/2 & 0 & 1/2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Which is not equal to P. So P is not idempotent, hence not a projection operator. So, my earlier approach was correct.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is 1, but according to my calculations, it's 1/3. Maybe I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, let me recalculate the inner product.

ψ_normalized is [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]

v is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ]

So, their inner product is:

(-1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/√2)

= (-1)/(√12) + 0 + (-1)/(√12)

= (-2)/(2√3) = (-1)/√3

So, squared modulus is 1/3.

Wait, but what if the observable is not normalized? Or maybe I misapplied the observable.

Wait, another approach: The probability of measuring 0 is equal to the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace of 0. Since P is Hermitian, the probability is the squared norm of the projection.

Alternatively, the probability is equal to the expectation value of the observable when the state is projected onto the eigenspace.

Wait, but that's the same as what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is already in the eigenspace of 0, but when I computed Pψ, I got [√2, 0, √2]^T, which is not zero, so it's not in the eigenspace.

Wait, but maybe I should check the eigenspace again.

Earlier, I found that for λ=0, the eigenvectors are [a, 0, -a], so any vector of the form (a, 0, -a). Let's see if ψ is in that space.

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]. If it were in the eigenspace, then the second component would be 0, but it's 2. So no, it's not in the eigenspace.

Therefore, the probability is not 1, but 1/3. So why does the user say the correct answer is 1?

Wait, maybe the observable P has eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity 1, and the corresponding eigenvector is [1,0,-1]. So, the projection of ψ onto this eigenvector is 1/3, so probability is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable P is the identity matrix? No, it's not. Or maybe it's diagonal?

Wait, perhaps P is the projector onto some subspace. Wait, no, P is not idempotent, as we saw P^2 ≠ P.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, and the state ψ is such that when you measure P, you always get 0. But that would mean Pψ = 0, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is such that 0 is the only possible outcome, but that's not true because the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.

Wait, maybe the user is mistaken. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue calculation.

Wait, let's re-examine the eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation was -λ³ + λ = 0, so λ(λ² -1) =0, so λ=0,1,-1. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe the eigenvectors are different.

Wait, for λ=0, we had v2=0, and v1 = -v3. So, eigenvector [1,0,-1], correct.

For λ=1, let's find the eigenvectors.

Solve (P - I)v = 0.

So,

Row 1: -1*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 -1*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 -1*v3 = 0

From row 1: -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

From row 3: (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

From row 2: (1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

Substitute v1 and v3:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) = (1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/2 v2) = (1/2 -1 +1/2)v2 = (-0)v2 = 0

So, consistent. Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form v2*[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

So, normalized, it's (1/√( (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 )) * [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

Compute the norm:

(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = 2, so sqrt(2). Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1/√2, 1, 1/√2] = [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]

Wait, let me compute it correctly:

The vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]. Its norm squared is (1/2 +1 +1/2)=2, so norm is √2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1/√2, 1, 1/√2] = [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]

Similarly, for λ=-1, eigenvectors would be similar but with signs flipped.

But going back, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, not 1. So why does the user say it's 1?

Wait, perhaps the observable is being measured in a different basis? Or maybe I misapplied the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe the observable P is such that when you apply it to ψ, you get 0, but that's not the case.

Wait, compute Pψ:

As before, Pψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T, which is not zero, so ψ is not in the eigenspace of 0.

Wait, but maybe the observable is being measured in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the observable is not Hermitian, but the user says it's an observable, which should be Hermitian.

Wait, is P Hermitian? Let's check. The conjugate transpose of P should equal P.

Given P has real entries except for 1/√2, which are real, so P is symmetric, hence P = P^T, so yes, it's Hermitian.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are real, which they are: 0,1,-1.

So, the probability should be 1/3, but the user says it's 1.

Wait, maybe the user is confused, or there's a typo in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is such that when you measure it, you always get 0 regardless of the state. But that can't be, because P has eigenvalues 0,1,-1.

Alternatively, maybe the state ψ is in the eigenspace of another observable Q, but not P.

Wait, let me check: If I compute Pψ, I get [√2, 0, √2]^T. If I compute P^2 ψ, I get P applied to [√2,0,√2]^T.

Compute P^2 ψ:

First row: 0*√2 + (1/√2)*0 +0*√2 =0

Second row: (1/√2)*√2 +0*0 + (1/√2)*√2= 1 +1=2

Third row: 0*√2 + (1/√2)*0 +0*√2=0

So, P^2 ψ = [0,2,0]^T

Similarly, compute P^3 ψ = P(P^2 ψ) = P [0,2,0]^T

First row:0*0 + (1/√2)*2 +0*0=2/√2=√2

Second row: (1/√2)*0 +0*2 + (1/√2)*0=0

Third row:0*0 + (1/√2)*2 +0*0=√2

So, P^3 ψ = [√2,0,√2]^T, same as Pψ.

So, this suggests that applying P repeatedly cycles between these states, but it doesn't give any information about the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable is being measured in a different way, but I think the standard approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable P is being misapplied. Perhaps the observable is represented by another matrix, but the user wrote P correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the state is given as a row vector, but it's stated as a column matrix.

Wait, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). So, it's a column vector.

Wait, unless the observable is applied differently, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, let me check the eigenvectors again.

For λ=0, eigenvector [1,0,-1], normalized to 1/√2.

For λ=1, eigenvector [1/√2,1,1/√2], normalized to 1/√2.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again.

ψ_normalized is [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]

v0 is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ]

v1 is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ] normalized to [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2 ]

Wait, no, earlier I thought v1 was [1/√2,1,1/√2 ] normalized to 1/√2, but actually, the norm was √(1/2 +1 +1/2)=√2, so normalized is [1/2,1/√2,1/2].

Wait, let me compute the inner product with v1:

⟨ψ_normalized | v1⟩ = (-1/√6)(1/2) + (2/√6)(1/√2) + (1/√6)(1/2)

= (-1)/(2√6) + (2)/(√6√2) + 1/(2√6)

Combine terms:

= [ (-1 +1) ]/(2√6) + (2)/(√12)

= 0 + (2)/(2√3) = 1/√3

So, squared modulus is 1/3.

Similarly, for λ=-1, let's find the eigenvector.

For λ=-1, solve (P + I)v=0.

Row 1: -1*v1 + (1/√2)v2 +0*v3=0 => -v1 + (1/√2)v2=0 => v1=(1/√2)v2

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 -1*v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Substitute v1=(1/√2)v2:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)v3= (1/2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)v3= (-1/2 v2) + (1/√2)v3=0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 -1*v3=0 => (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 => v3=(1/√2)v2

From row 3: v3=(1/√2)v2

Substitute into row 2 equation:

-1/2 v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2)= -1/2 v2 + 1/2 v2=0, which is always true.

Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=-1 are v2*[1/√2,1,1/√2]

So, normalized, it's same as v1 but with different sign? Wait, no, for λ=1 and λ=-1, the eigenvectors are same structure but signs may differ.

Wait, actually, for λ=1, we had v = [1/√2,1,1/√2], and for λ=-1, it's [1/√2,1,1/√2] as well? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when λ=1, we had v1 =1/√2 v2, v3=1/√2 v2, and v2 is free.

Similarly, for λ=-1, same structure. So, the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are the same in direction? That can't be.

Wait, no, because when λ=1, the equation was (P - I)v=0, leading to v1=1/√2 v2, v3=1/√2 v2

For λ=-1, (P + I)v=0, leading to v1=1/√2 v2, v3=1/√2 v2

So, the eigenvectors are same for both eigenvalues, which can't be. That suggests that I made a mistake.

Wait, no, actually, for λ=-1, the eigenvectors should be orthogonal to those for λ=1. So, I must have made a mistake in the eigenvectors.

Wait, let me re-express.

For λ=1:

We had:

v1 = (1/√2) v2

v3 = (1/√2) v2

So, eigenvector is [1/√2,1,1/√2]

For λ=-1:

We have:

From row 1: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0 => v1=(1/√2)v2

From row 3: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 => v3=(1/√2)v2

So, same as λ=1, but this can't be, because eigenvectors for different eigenvalues should be orthogonal.

Wait, this suggests that I have a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, no, for λ=-1, the equations lead to same relationships as for λ=1, which suggests that the eigenspace is same, which can't be.

Wait, that suggests that P has a two-dimensional eigenspace for λ=1 or λ=-1, but that contradicts the characteristic equation which had three distinct eigenvalues.

Wait, no, the characteristic equation has λ=0,1,-1, so three distinct eigenvalues, each with multiplicity 1.

Therefore, for λ=1 and λ=-1, the eigenvectors should be unique up to scaling.

So, perhaps I missed a sign.

Wait, no, for λ=1, we had v1=1/√2 v2, v3=1/√2 v2, so eigenvector [1/√2,1,1/√2]

For λ=-1, from (P + I)v=0:

Row 1: -v1 + (1/√2)v2=0 => v1= (1/√2)v2

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 -v2 + (1/√2)v3=0 => substitute v1=1/√2 v2 and v3=1/√2 v2:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2)= (1/2 v2) -v2 + (1/2 v2)= (-1/2 +1/2)v2=0

Row 3: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 => v3=1/√2 v2

So, eigenvectors for λ=-1 are [1/√2,1,1/√2], same as for λ=1. That can't be, because eigenvectors for different eigenvalues should be distinct.

Wait, this suggests that I have a mistake in the eigenvectors.

Wait, no, actually, for λ=1 and λ=-1, the eigenvectors are same. That can't be, because the eigenvalues are distinct.

Wait, no, that must mean that I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are orthogonal.

Suppose, for λ=1, eigenvector is [a,b,c], then for λ=-1, it's [d,e,f], such that their dot product is zero.

But given that both eigenvectors have the same form, it's hard to see.

Wait, perhaps I should choose v for λ=1 as [1, √2,1], but that seems arbitrary.

Wait, no, perhaps I should recompute eigenvectors more carefully.

For λ=1:

(P - I)v = 0

Row 1: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0 => v1=(1/√2)v2

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 -v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Substitute v1=(1/√2)v2:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)v3= (1/2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)v3= (-1/2 v2) + (1/√2)v3=0

Row 3: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 => v3=(1/√2)v2

Substitute v3 into row 2:

-1/2 v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2)= -1/2 v2 + 1/2 v2=0

So, consistent. Therefore, v1=1/√2 v2, v3=1/√2 v2

So, eigenvector for λ=1 is [1/√2,1,1/√2], which can be written as [1,√2,1]/√2

Similarly, for λ=-1:

From (P + I)v=0

Row 1: -v1 + (1/√2)v2=0 => v1=(1/√2)v2

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 -v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Substitute v1=1/√2 v2:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) -v2 + (1/√2)v3= 1/2 v2 -v2 + (1/√2)v3= -1/2 v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Row 3: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 => v3=(1/√2)v2

Substitute into row 2:

-1/2 v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2)= -1/2 v2 +1/2 v2=0

So, same as λ=1, which is confusing.

Wait, but this suggests that for both λ=1 and λ=-1, the eigenvectors are same, which can't be.

Wait, no, actually, no, for λ=-1, the eigenvector would be different.

Wait, no, the calculation shows that for λ=-1, the eigenvectors are same as for λ=1, which can't be, because they are for distinct eigenvalues.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me assume that the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are orthogonal to each other and to the eigenvector for λ=0.

So, eigenvector for λ=0 is [1,0,-1], let's call it v0.

Eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 should be orthogonal to v0.

Let me assume that eigenv
[overthinking]
Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that measuring the observable P at time t will yield 0. The state of the system at time t is given as the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The operator P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements in each row.

First, let me write down the given information to make it clearer.

The state vector is:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
And the observable matrix P is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (in this case, 0) is related to the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, I think I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the probability.

But wait, maybe I should first ensure that P is a Hermitian matrix because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian.

A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Looking at P:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Second row: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Third row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

The conjugate transpose of P would have the same elements since all entries are real. So, the (1,2) entry is 1/√2, which matches the (2,1) entry. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/√2, which matches the (3,2) entry. So, yes, P is Hermitian. Good, that makes sense for an observable.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the squared magnitude of the inner product between ψ and each eigenvector. The sum of these probabilities should give the total probability of measuring 0.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Maybe 0 is an eigenvalue, so let's check.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the characteristic equation is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ
\end{vmatrix} = 0
\]

Calculating this determinant might be a bit involved. Let me expand it.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det \begin{bmatrix} -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ \end{bmatrix} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} * det \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & -λ \end{bmatrix} + 0 * det(...) 

So, that's:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0

Simplify each part:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2) [ (-λ)/√2 ] = - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = - ( -λ / 2 ) = λ/2

So, overall determinant equation:

(-λ³ + λ/2) + λ/2 = 0

Simplify:

-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Therefore, the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1. So, the probability of getting 0 is non-zero, depending on the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

So, let's find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 => Pv = 0.

So, write down the equations:

First row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Second row: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

Third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as first row, so v2=0.

So, from first and third equations, v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

Therefore, the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So, normalized, the eigenvector is (1/√2)[1, 0, -1]^T because the norm squared is 1² + 0 + (-1)² = 2, so sqrt(2) is the norm.

Wait, actually, when you normalize, you take the vector and divide by its norm. So, [1,0,-1] has norm sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Let me write that:

e = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix}

So, any vector in the null space of P is a scalar multiple of this.

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by e.

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is |⟨ψ, e⟩|².

Compute ⟨ψ, e⟩:

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]^T, e is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

So, their inner product is:

(-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Wait, hold on: (-1)(1/√2) is -1/√2, and (1)(-1/√2) is also -1/√2. So, total is (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Therefore, the inner product is -√2, and the probability is | -√2 |² = (√2)² = 2.

But wait, probabilities can't be greater than 1. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Maybe my eigenvector is not correctly normalized?

Wait, let's re-examine. The eigenvector I found is [1, 0, -1], which has norm sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, to normalize it, we divide by sqrt(2). So, e is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

So, when we compute the inner product, it's:

(-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

So, the inner product is -sqrt(2), so the squared magnitude is (sqrt(2))² = 2.

But probabilities can't be more than 1. Hmm, that suggests that either my eigenvector is not normalized correctly, or I made an error elsewhere.

Wait, let's check the normalization of e. The norm squared is (1/sqrt(2))² + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1. So, e is indeed normalized. So, the inner product calculation should be correct, but the result is -sqrt(2), whose magnitude squared is 2.

But that's a problem because the probability can't exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait a second, perhaps I misapplied the concept. Maybe the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, but the probabilities should sum to 1.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe I should diagonalize P and compute the expectation value or something else?

Wait, no. The probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of ψ onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just |⟨ψ, e⟩|², where e is the normalized eigenvector.

But in this case, that gives me 2, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in computing the inner product.

Wait, let's compute the inner product again:

⟨ψ, e⟩ = (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2)

= (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2)

= (-2)/√2 = -√2

So, the magnitude squared is ( -√2 )² = 2.

Hmm, that's definitely 2. But this can't be a probability.

Wait, maybe the state vector ψ is not normalized? Let me check the norm of ψ.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, ψ is not a unit vector. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by unit vectors. Maybe the given state is not normalized, so I need to normalize it first.

So, if ψ has a norm of sqrt(6), then the normalized state would be ψ / sqrt(6). Let me write that.

Normalized ψ:

ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T = \begin{bmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{bmatrix}

So, if I compute the inner product with ψ_normalized and e, then square it, that will give the correct probability.

Let me compute ⟨ψ_normalized, e⟩.

ψ_normalized is [-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6]^T

e is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T

So, inner product is:

(-1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/√2)

= (-1)/(√6√2) + 0 + (-1)/(√6√2)

= (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

So, the magnitude squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

But wait, the original question didn't mention normalizing ψ. So, maybe they consider the state as given, not necessarily normalized.

In that case, the probability would be |⟨ψ, e⟩|² / ⟨ψ, ψ⟩.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |⟨e, ψ⟩|² divided by ⟨ψ, ψ⟩ if ψ is not normalized. So, yes.

So, in this case, ⟨ψ, e⟩ = -√2, so |⟨ψ, e⟩|² = 2.

And ⟨ψ, ψ⟩ = 6.

Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

But the user says the correct answer is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, so something is wrong here. Either my reasoning is incorrect, or the given state is supposed to be an eigenvector of P.

Wait, let me check if ψ is an eigenvector of P.

Compute Pψ:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = (2)/√2 = √2

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

So, Pψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T

Compare with ψ: [-1, 2, 1]^T

They are not scalar multiples. So, ψ is not an eigenvector of P.

Therefore, P is not a multiple of ψ, so the state is not in the eigenspace of P.

Therefore, the probability should not be 1.

Wait, but the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something else.

Wait, let's go back.

Compute Pψ:

First component:

Row 1 of P times ψ: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

Second component:

Row 2 of P times ψ: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0

Third component:

Row 3 of P times ψ: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = √2

So, Pψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T

Now, if I compute Pψ, does it relate to ψ in any way? Let's see.

If we compare Pψ to ψ, is there a scalar λ such that Pψ = λψ?

Looking at the components:

First component: √2 vs -1

Second: 0 vs 2

Third: √2 vs 1

So, no scalar λ would satisfy √2 = λ*(-1) and 0 = λ*2 and √2 = λ*1.

Therefore, ψ is not an eigenvector of P, so measurement does not yield a certain outcome with probability 1.

So, the probability of measuring 0 is |⟨e, ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ, ψ⟩ = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But since the user says the correct answer is 1, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the observable.

Wait, the observable is represented by P, but in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. But if the state is not normalized, then we have to normalize it first.

Alternatively, maybe the operator P is actually the projection onto the eigenspace? Wait, no, P is the observable matrix.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable P is being considered in a way where it's already diagonal, but no, P isn't diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of P and see what it gives? But that might not directly help with the probability of measuring 0.

Alternatively, maybe I need to find all the eigenvectors and compute the probabilities for each eigenvalue.

We have eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

We found eigenvector for 0: e = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T

Now, let's find eigenvectors for λ = 1 and λ = -1.

Starting with λ = 1:

Solve (P - I)v = 0

P - I:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1/√2 & 0 \\
1/√2 & -1 & 1/√2 \\
0 & 1/√2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So, the equations:

-1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 --> -v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 --> v1 = (1/√2) v2

(1/√2)*v1 - v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 - v3 = 0 --> (1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 --> v3 = (1/√2) v2

From first equation: v1 = (1/√2) v2

From third equation: v3 = (1/√2) v2

Plug into second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) = (1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/2 v2) = (1/2 - 1 + 1/2) v2 = (-0) v2 = 0

So, the equations are consistent. So, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form:

v = [ (1/√2) v2, v2, (1/√2) v2 ]^T = v2 [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T

So, the eigenvector can be written as [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T, normalized.

Compute the norm: (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2

So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T = [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]^T.

Wait, no, if the vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2], its norm squared is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]^T.

Wait, no, if you have [a, b, c], and you normalize it, you divide each component by the norm. So, if the vector is [1/√2, 1, 1/√2], the norm is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, the normalized vector is [1/√2 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2), 1/√2 / sqrt(2)] = [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2].

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me recast it.

Let me write the vector as v = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T. The norm squared is (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(2). So, normalized eigenvector is v / sqrt(2) = [1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/2]^T.

Wait, 1/√2 divided by sqrt(2) is (1/√2) / (sqrt(2)) = 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1/2.

Similarly, 1 divided by sqrt(2) is 1/sqrt(2).

So, yes, the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -1:

Solve (P + I)v = 0

P + I:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1/√2 & 0 \\
1/√2 & 1 & 1/√2 \\
0 & 1/√2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The equations:

1*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 --> v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 --> v1 = - (1/√2) v2

(1/√2)*v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 1*v3 = 0 --> (1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0 --> v3 = - (1/√2) v2

From first equation: v1 = - (1/√2) v2

From third equation: v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Plug into second equation:

(1/√2)*(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2 v2) = (-1/2 v2) + v2 + (-1/2 v2) = (-1/2 + 1 - 1/2) v2 = 0 v2 = 0

So, consistent. So, eigenvectors are of the form:

v = [ -1/√2 v2, v2, -1/√2 v2 ]^T = v2 [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T divided by its norm.

Compute the norm squared: (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). Therefore, normalized eigenvector is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So, now we have all the normalized eigenvectors:

For λ=0: e0 = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T

For λ=1: e1 = [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]^T

For λ=-1: e-1 = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Now, we can compute the probabilities.

First, compute the inner products of ψ with each eigenvector.

But wait, ψ is not normalized, as we saw earlier. Its norm squared is 6.

Therefore, the probability of measuring λ=0 is |⟨ψ, e0⟩|² / ⟨ψ, ψ⟩

Similarly for λ=1 and λ=-1.

So, compute ⟨ψ, e0⟩:

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

e0 = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T

Inner product: (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2

So, |⟨ψ, e0⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2

Similarly, compute ⟨ψ, e1⟩:

e1 = [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]^T

Inner product: (-1)(1/2) + (2)(1/√2) + (1)(1/2) = (-1/2) + (2/√2) + (1/2) = ( -1/2 + 1/2 ) + 2/√2 = 0 + √2 ≈ 1.414

So, |⟨ψ, e1⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2

Similarly, compute ⟨ψ, e-1⟩:

e-1 = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Inner product: (-1)(-1/2) + (2)(1/√2) + (1)(-1/2) = (1/2) + (2/√2) + (-1/2) = (1/2 - 1/2) + √2 = 0 + √2 ≈ 1.414

So, |⟨ψ, e-1⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2

So, the squared magnitudes are all 2.

But the total norm of ψ is sqrt(6), so the probabilities are each 2/6 = 1/3.

So, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, same as measuring 1 and same as measuring -1.

But again, the user says the correct answer is 1. So, I must have messed up something in the process.

Wait, let's consider the possibility that the given matrix P is not the observable but the projection operator. But no, the question says P is the observable, so it should be a Hermitian operator with real eigenvalues, which it is.

Alternatively, maybe I computed the eigenvectors incorrectly? Let me double-check.

For λ=0, we had e0 = [1, 0, -1]^T normalized to [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T, that seems correct.

For λ=1, the eigenvector was [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]^T, normalized to [1/2, 1/√2, 1/2]^T, that seems correct.

For λ=-1, eigenvector was [ -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ]^T, normalized to [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T, that seems correct.

So, the inner products all result in |⟨ψ, e⟩|² = 2, so each probability is 1/3.

But why is the user saying the correct answer is 1?

Wait, perhaps P is being interpreted as a projection operator, not the observable. Maybe the observable is actually the projection onto the eigenspace of 0, but no, the question says P is the observable.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, but when I checked earlier, ψ is not an eigenvector.

Wait, let me compute Pψ:

Earlier, I found Pψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T

But what if I compute P^2 ψ?

Compute P squared:

P^2 = P * P

Let me compute P^2:

First row of P times each column of P:

First element:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second element:

0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Wait, no, that's not correct. To compute P^2, we need to perform matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me properly compute P^2:

First row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by first column of P:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

First row of P times second column of P:

0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

First row of P times third column of P:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Second row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Multiply by first column of P:

(1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Second row of P times second column of P:

(1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1

Second row of P times third column of P:

(1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

So, second row of P^2 is [0, 1, 0]

Third row of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Multiply by first column of P:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Third row of P times second column of P:

0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third row of P times third column of P:

0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, third row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Therefore, P^2 is:

[
[1/2, 0, 1/2],
[0, 1, 0],
[1/2, 0, 1/2]
]

Now, compute P^2 ψ:

First component:

(1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + 0 + 1/2 = 0

Second component:

0*(-1) + 1*2 + 0*1 = 2

Third component:

(1/2)(-1) + 0*2 + (1/2)(1) = (-1/2) + 0 + 1/2 = 0

So, P^2 ψ = [0, 2, 0]^T

Compare with ψ: [-1, 2, 1]^T

So, P^2 ψ = [0, 2, 0]^T

Which is not the same as ψ or any multiple.

Therefore, not an eigenvector for P^2 either.

So, the only conclusion is that the probability is 1/3, but the user says it's 1.

Wait, maybe the state is being considered in a different basis where P is diagonal? Or perhaps I misinterpreted the state vector.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Maybe this is a row vector instead of a column vector? Let me check.

But the question says it's a column matrix, so it's a column vector.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expectation value, but that's not the same as the probability.

Wait, let me compute the expectation value of P for the state ψ.

The expectation value is ⟨ψ, P ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ, ψ⟩.

Compute ⟨ψ, P ψ⟩:

Earlier, we found P ψ = [√2, 0, √2]^T

So, ⟨ψ, P ψ⟩ = (-1)(√2) + 2*0 + 1*(√2) = (-√2) + 0 + √2 = 0

⟨ψ, ψ⟩ = 6

So, expectation value is 0/6 = 0.

But that doesn't directly help with the probability.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable P is such that 0 is its only possible outcome. But no, we saw that P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, is there a possibility that the state is in the null space of P? But we saw that the null space is the eigenspace for 0, which is [1, 0, -1]^T. Our ψ is not in that space.

Wait, earlier we saw that ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T is not in the null space because P ψ is not zero.

Wait, in the null space, we have vectors [v1, 0, v3] where v1 = -v3.

But ψ has v2=2, which is not zero, so ψ is not in the null space.

Wait, but the probability is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333, not 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was about an operator with only eigenvalue 0, but no, P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, sometimes observables are projectors, but in this case, P is given as a 3x3 matrix, which is not a projector unless it's idempotent.

But earlier, we computed P^2, and it wasn't equal to P.

Indeed, P^2 is:

[
[1/2, 0, 1/2],
[0, 1, 0],
[1/2, 0, 1/2]
]

Which is not equal to P.

So, P is not a projector, but a general observable.

Wait, unless we're talking about projective measurements, but in that case, the observable would be diagonal in the eigenbasis.

Wait, no, in any case, the earlier approach should hold.

Alternatively, maybe the state is given in a different basis where P is diagonal. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a Pauli matrix or something similar.

Wait, P is:

[
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Which looks like a combination of Pauli matrices, perhaps.

But maybe diagonalizing it is the way to go, but I already did that.

Wait, could the state ψ be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P?

Yes, because P is a Hermitian operator, so its eigenvectors form a basis.

So, ψ can be written as a linear combination of e0, e1, e-1.

Compute the coefficients:

Coefficient c0 = ⟨e0, ψ⟩ = (-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2

Similarly, c1 = ⟨e1, ψ⟩ = (-1)(1/2) + 2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/2) = (-1/2 + 1/2) + 2/√2 = 0 + √2

c-1 = ⟨e-1, ψ⟩ = (-1)(-1/2) + 2*(1/√2) + 1*(-1/2) = (1/2 - 1/2) + 2/√2 = 0 + √2

Therefore, ψ = c0 e0 + c1 e1 + c-1 e-1

But since e0, e1, e-1 are orthonormal, we can write ψ as:

ψ = (-√2) e0 + √2 e1 + √2 e-1

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is |c0|² / ||ψ||² = ( (√2)^2 ) / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3

Similarly for others.

So, the probability of measuring
[overthinking]
Okay, so I've got this problem about the state of a system and an observable, and I need to find the probability that measuring the observable will give 0. Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics class that observables are represented by matrices, and the states are vectors. The probability is calculated by taking the inner product of the state with an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue we're interested in. 

Let me write down what I have. The state vector at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, in matrix form, that's:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

And the observable P is given as:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

I need to find the probability of measuring 0. So first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. The eigenvalues will give me the possible outcomes of the measurement, and the eigenvectors will help me compute the probability.

Let me find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Calculating the determinant of (P - λI):

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ
\end{vmatrix}
= 0
\]

Expanding this determinant. Maybe it's a bit messy, but let's try. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row.

So, determinant = (-λ) * det\(\begin{pmatrix} -λ & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -λ \end{pmatrix}\) - \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) * det\(\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 & -λ \end{pmatrix}\) + 0 * det(...)

So, the last term is zero, so we can ignore it. Let's compute the first two terms.

First term: (-λ) * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] = (-λ) * [λ² - (1/2)] = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) = - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 ) = (λ)/2

So, determinant is (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Set determinant equal to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0  
λ(-λ² + 1) = 0  
So, eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the possible outcomes are -1, 0, and 1. Therefore, if we want the probability of getting 0, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ = 0, and then compute the inner product with the state vector ψ.

Now, let's find the eigenvector for λ = 0.

We need to solve (P - 0I) v = 0, so P v = 0.

So, writing out the equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \)

From equation 1 and 3: v2 = 0.

From equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0 => v1 = -v3

So, the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 can be written as:

\[
v = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

But we can scale it by any non-zero scalar. Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, we can normalize it if needed, but for the inner product, the scaling won't matter because we'll take the modulus squared.

Wait, but maybe I should normalize it? Because when calculating probabilities, we need the state vector and the eigenvectors to be normalized.

Hmm, let's check. The state vector ψ is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is it normalized? Let's compute its norm.

Norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. Maybe I should normalize ψ first?

Wait, but the observable P is an operator, and in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the probabilities are calculated with respect to the normalized state. So, perhaps I should normalize ψ before computing the inner product.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are already normalized? Let me check the eigenvector for λ=0.

The eigenvector I found is (1, 0, -1). Its norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So, norm is sqrt(2). So, to make it a unit vector, I should divide by sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector u is:

\[
u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, now, the probability of measuring 0 is |⟨u | ψ⟩|².

Wait, but ψ is not normalized. So, should I normalize ψ first? Or, in the formula, it's |⟨u | ψ⟩|² divided by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩? Hmm, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to be normalized, so the probability is |⟨u | ψ⟩|², but if ψ is not normalized, the probability would be |⟨u | ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||².

Let me think. The general formula is:

Probability = |⟨u | ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||²

Because ψ might not be normalized, so we have to normalize the inner product accordingly.

But in some textbooks, they might assume that ψ is already normalized. Let's see. Let's compute both ways.

First, compute ⟨u | ψ⟩:

u is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

ψ is (-1, 2, 1)

So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1)/√2 + 0 + (-1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2

So, |⟨u | ψ⟩|² = ( -√2 )² = 2.

Now, compute ||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, but the user is saying the correct answer is 1. That can't be right because 1/3 is not 1. So, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's double-check. Maybe I did the inner product incorrectly.

Wait, let's recalculate the inner product:

u is [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]

So, the inner product is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1

Which is (-1)/√2 + 0 + (-1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Square of that is (√2)^2 = 2.

But then ||ψ||² is 6, so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Hmm, but the user says "Why the correct answer is 1?" So, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to normalize the eigenvector differently or check if my eigenvector is correct.

Wait, so P is given, and I found the eigenvector for λ=0 as (1, 0, -1). But let's make sure that this is correct.

Let me plug it back into P:

P * v = 0 * v

Compute P * (1, 0, -1):

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

So, yes, that's correct. So eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), which is correct.

Wait, but is that the only eigenvector for λ=0? Maybe there are more?

Wait, the matrix P is 3x3, and the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So, each eigenvalue has multiplicity 1, I think. So, geometric multiplicity is 1 for each.

Therefore, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, maybe I need to normalize the eigenvector before taking the inner product.

Wait, but I did normalize it. The normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the non-normalized eigenvector. Let's see.

Compute inner product with non-normalized eigenvector:

⟨v | ψ⟩, where v = (1, 0, -1).

So, inner product is (-1)*1 + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.

Then, |⟨v | ψ⟩|² = (-2)^2 = 4.

But then, the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), and the norm of v is sqrt(2). So, perhaps the probability is |⟨v | ψ⟩|² / (||v||² ||ψ||²) = 4 / (2*6) = 4/12 = 1/3.

Same result. So regardless of normalization, the probability is 1/3. So, why is the correct answer 1?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the eigenvector.

Wait, let's see. The P matrix is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So, for λ=0, we have the equations:

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 --> v2 = 0

(1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 --> v1 + v3 = 0

0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 --> v2 = 0

So, same as before, v2=0, v1 = -v3.

Thus, eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). So, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the eigenvectors might be complex or something else? No, the matrix is real.

Wait, another thought: is P a Hermitian matrix? Because in quantum mechanics, observables must be Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian.

A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, it's equivalent to being symmetric.

Looking at P:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Second row: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Third row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So, the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are both 1/√2, which is symmetric. Similarly, (2,3) and (3,2) are both 1/√2. And the diagonal is zero. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are real, and we have correct eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors are different? Let me think. Maybe the eigenvector for λ=0 is different? Or maybe I need to consider that the eigenvectors should be normalized in a different way?

Wait, but u is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, when I take the inner product with ψ, which is (-1, 2, 1), I get (-1)(1/√2) + 0 + 1*(-1/√2) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So, modulus squared is 2. Then, as the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), the probability is 2/6=1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the expectation value or something else? No, the question is about probability, so it's the modulus squared of the inner product.

Wait, unless the eigenvector is wrong? Or perhaps the eigenvalue 0 is not in the spectrum? But we found λ=0 is an eigenvalue.

Wait, let me compute P^2 and see if it's identity or something else.

Wait, maybe P is a projection operator? Because sometimes observables can be projection operators, which satisfy P^2 = P.

Let me compute P squared:

P^2 = P * P.

Let me compute the (1,1) entry:

Row 1 of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 1 of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Similarly, (1,2) entry:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

(1,3) entry:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Similarly, (2,1) entry:

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Column 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

(2,2) entry:

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Column 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

(2,3) entry:

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Column 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

(3,1) entry:

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

(3,2) entry:

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Dot product: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

(3,3) entry:

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Column 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Dot product: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So, putting it all together, P^2 is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1/2 & 0 & 1/2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Which is not equal to P, since P had 1/√2 in off-diagonal terms, but here it's 1/2 or 0 or 1. So, P^2 ≠ P, so P is not a projection operator. Therefore, it's not idempotent. So, that line of thought doesn't help.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. If P is an observable, maybe it's diagonalizable, and we can diagonalize it and find the probabilities.

But we already have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in an eigenstate of P, but no, because ψ is (-1,2,1), which is not a multiple of any of the eigenvectors we found.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observable P is such that when you measure it, the probabilities are proportional to the squares of the entries in the matrix? No, that doesn't make sense. Probabilities come from the state vector's projection onto the eigenspaces.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of getting 0, so I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, unless the eigenvectors are different. Let me try to find another eigenvector for λ=0.

But from the equations, we had v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So, that's the only solution. So, eigenvectors are multiples of (1,0,-1). So, that should be correct.

Wait, let me check the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 just to make sure.

For λ=1:

Solve (P - I)v = 0

So, matrix:

-1 at diagonal, and 1/√2 elsewhere except for the diagonal.

Wait, no, P - I is:

[
[-1, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -1, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -1]
]

So, equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0

From equation 3: (1/√2) v2 = v3 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

From equation 1: -v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2) = 0

Compute:

(1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/2) v2 = 0

Combine terms: (1/2 -1 + 1/2) v2 = (-0) v2 = 0

So, it's satisfied for any v2. Therefore, the eigenvector is:

v = [1/√2, 1, 1/√2] scaled by v2.

Wait, let me write it as v2*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2). So, the eigenvector is proportional to (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). To make it a unit vector, we can compute its norm:

(1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. So, norm is sqrt(2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2). Wait, no.

Wait, actually, (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) has norm squared 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. So, normalized vector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2). Wait, no, more accurately, dividing each component by sqrt(2):

(1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/2, 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2, and same for the last component.

So, normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2). Hmm, seems a bit messy. Alternatively, let's just keep it as (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) for eigenvector.

Similarly, for λ=-1, we can compute, but since the probability for 0 is 1/3, and the user says the correct answer is 1, I must be missing something.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the observable is such that when you measure it, the probabilities are given by the sum of squares of certain components?

Wait, but that's not how it works. The probability is given by the projection onto the eigenspace.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the matrix P is actually a projection matrix? But we saw that P^2 ≠ P, so it's not.

Alternatively, maybe the state is already an eigenstate?

Wait, the state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if it's an eigenvector of P.

Compute P * ψ:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 + 1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

So, Pψ = [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T

Which is not a multiple of ψ, because ψ is (-1, 2, 1). So, Pψ is not proportional to ψ, so ψ is not an eigenvector of P. Therefore, not an eigenstate.

Wait, another idea: maybe the observable P is a sum of projection operators? Or perhaps it's a diagonal matrix? No, it's not diagonal.

Wait, I'm stuck. Why is the probability 1? That would mean that the state is entirely in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, but our calculation shows that it's only 1/3.

Wait, maybe the eigenvector is incorrect. Let me check the eigenvectors again.

For λ=0, we had v = (1, 0, -1). Let's see if this is correct.

P * v:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = 0

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0

So, indeed, P*v=0, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe there are more eigenvectors for λ=0?

In the system, if the algebraic multiplicity is higher, but geometric multiplicity is 1, so the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So, no, only multiples of (1,0,-1) are in the eigenspace.

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me read the problem again.

"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), in the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2) and in the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t. Why the correct answer is 1."

Wait, perhaps the system is actually in a different state. Wait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is that a column vector? Yes, so it's as I wrote before.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the probabilities for all eigenvalues and see if they sum to 1. Let's compute probabilities for λ=1 and λ=-1 as well.

Earlier, I found that the eigenvectors for λ=1 is proportional to (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). So, normalized eigenvector u1 is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) divided by sqrt(2), which is (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2).

Wait, actually, let me recast:

The eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). Its norm is sqrt( (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(2). So, normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2). Wait, no, dividing each component by sqrt(2):

(1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/2, 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2, and same for the last component. So, u1 = (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

Wait, maybe I need to be precise.

Wait, the vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). To normalize, divide by sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2). So, normalized u1 is (1/(2), 1/√2, 1/2).

Wait, let's compute the inner product of ψ with u1.

ψ is (-1, 2, 1). So, inner product is:

(-1)*(1/2) + 2*(1/√2) + 1*(1/2) = (-1/2) + 2/√2 + 1/2 = ( -1/2 + 1/2 ) + sqrt(2) = 0 + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Thus, |⟨u1 | ψ⟩|² = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Similarly, for λ=-1.

What's the eigenvector for λ=-1?

Let me compute. (P + I)v = 0

So, matrix:

1 at diagonal, and 1/√2 elsewhere.

So,

[
[1, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 1, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 1]
]

Equations:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0

From equation 1: v1 = - (1/√2) v2

From equation 3: v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = 0

Compute:

(-1/2 v2) + v2 + (-1/2 v2) = (-1/2 + 1 -1/2) v2 = 0*v2 = 0

So, satisfied. Therefore, eigenvector is proportional to v2*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2). Let me choose v2 = √2 to make it integer:

v = (-1, √2, -1)

Wait, but to make it normalized, let's compute its norm.

(-1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 2 +1=4. So, norm is 2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector u-1 is (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2).

Compute inner product with ψ = (-1, 2, 1):

⟨u-1 | ψ⟩ = (-1/2)*(-1) + (√2/2)*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + (2√2)/2 + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + √2 = 0 + √2 = √2

Thus, |⟨u-1 | ψ⟩|² = 2.

So, total probabilities:

For λ=0: 2/6=1/3

For λ=1: 2/6=1/3

For λ=-1: 2/6=1/3

But wait, that sums to 1/3 +1/3 +1/3=1, which is correct.

But the probability for λ=0 is 1/3, so why does the user say the correct answer is 1?

Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the question. Let me read again.

"Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t. Why the correct answer is 1."

Wait, maybe the answer is 1 because the observable P is such that the only possible outcome is 0. But no, we found eigenvalues -1, 0, 1.

Wait, unless P is a projection operator onto the subspace where the outcome is 0, but no, we saw P^2 ≠ P.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the observable P is such that the probabilities for outcomes other than 0 are zero? But that would mean that ψ is in the eigenspace of λ=0, but our calculation shows that it's not.

Wait, let me compute the projection of ψ onto the eigenspace of λ=0. The eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by u = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). So, the projection is |⟨u | ψ⟩|² = 2, as we found before. But ψ is not normalized, so the normalized projection is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, unless the question is not about probability but about the expectation value? No, the question is about the probability.

Wait, unless the system is in an eigenstate, but we saw that ψ is not an eigenstate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product. Let me recalculate.

u is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)

ψ is (-1, 2, 1)

So, inner product is:

(1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1)/√2 + 0 + (-1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2

So, |⟨u | ψ⟩|² = (√2)^2 = 2

Then, the norm of ψ is sqrt(6), so the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3

Alternatively, if I don't normalize ψ, what's the probability?

If ψ is not normalized, the probability is |⟨u | ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||² = 2 / 6 = 1/3.

So, if the correct answer is 1, then my approach must be wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the observable P is the identity matrix? But no, it's given as P above.

Wait, let me compute P * ψ.

Earlier, we found Pψ = [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T.

But, in that case, if we compute the norm of Pψ, it's sqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + 0 + (sqrt(2))^2 ) = sqrt(2 + 0 + 2) = sqrt(4) = 2.

But ψ has norm sqrt(6). So, Pψ ≠ ψ, so ψ is not an eigenstate.

Wait, unless the system is such that ψ is orthogonal to the eigenspace for λ=0, but that would make the probability 0, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is different. Wait, maybe the eigenvectors are different. Let me think: is there another eigenvector for λ=0?

No, because the equations only give v2=0 and v1 = -v3, so the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

Wait, maybe the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1 are the same, but no, we have distinct eigenvectors.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the matrix P is such that when you measure it, the probabilities are not dependent on the state. But that's not the case here.

Wait, unless the state is orthogonal to all eigenvectors except for λ=0. But our calculation shows that it's 1/3.

Wait, maybe the observable P is such that the only possible outcome is 0? No, we found eigenvalues -1, 0, 1.

Wait, unless the observable P squares to the identity? Let's compute P^2.

Earlier, we found:

P^2 = [
[1/2, 0, 1/2],
[0, 1, 0],
[1/2, 0, 1/2]
]

Which is not equal to identity.

Wait, maybe P is a square root of some matrix? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the trace of P is zero? Let's check:

Trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, which is consistent with eigenvalues -1,0,1.

But that doesn't help with the probability.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the observable P is such that the measurement always yields 0, regardless of the state. But that would mean that P is zero matrix, which it's not.

Wait, unless the observable is such that it has only eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity 3, but no, we have eigenvalues -1,0,1.

Wait, another thought: maybe I messed up the eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, no, the equations were correct, and the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the observable is such that the probabilities are not calculated the usual way? Or the system is in a mixed state?

Wait
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about the state of a system and measuring an observable. The state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by this matrix P, which has specific elements. I need to calculate the probability that measuring P will yield 0, and the answer is supposed to be 1. Hmm, why is that?

First, let me recall what I know about observables and measurements in quantum mechanics. I remember that an observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that matrix. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is calculated using the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue. So, if I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, I can figure out the probability.

Looking at the matrix P, it has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write that down:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Is this matrix Hermitian? Well, looking at the elements, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both 1/√2, which are equal. The (1,3) and (3,1) elements are both 0, and the diagonal elements are all 0, which are real. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I should solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

Let's set up the matrix (P - λI):

[ [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
  [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, -λ ] ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ    1/√2    0     |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2   |
| 0    1/√2  -λ     |

I need to compute this determinant. Let me expand it along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.

The determinant would be:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * det(...)

So, the first term is -λ times the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2)

So, the first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2

The second term is -(1/√2) times the determinant of the matrix:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]

Which is (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 = -λ/√2

So, the second term is -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/2

The third term is 0, so we can ignore that.

Putting it all together, the determinant is:

-λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 = -λ³ + λ

So, the characteristic equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Which simplifies to λ(-λ² + 1) = 0

So, the solutions are λ = 0 and λ² = 1, which gives λ = 1 and λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

Now, the state of the system is given as a column matrix: (-1, 2, 1). I need to check if this state is an eigenvector of P, or perhaps it's a combination of eigenvectors.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components.

Let's compute the norm of the state vector:

|ψ|² = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

So, the norm is √6. Therefore, the state vector isn't normalized. But when calculating probabilities, we can either normalize it first or adjust our calculations accordingly.

But maybe I don't need to worry about normalization right now. Let me think.

The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

So, if I can find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, I can compute the probability.

But let's see. Maybe I don't need to compute the eigenvectors if I can do it another way.

Alternatively, since P is a projection operator, it might have eigenvalues 0 and 1. Wait, but earlier I found the eigenvalues to be 0, 1, and -1. So, that contradicts that idea. Maybe not a projection operator then.

Wait, hold on, P is supposed to be an observable, but projection operators are usually idempotent (P² = P), but let me check if P squared equals P.

Compute P²:

First row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0], so multiplying P by P:

First row, first column: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

First row, second column: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

First row, third column: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Wait, so the first row of P² is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Wait, that doesn't match the first row of P, which was [0, 1/√2, 0]. So, P squared is not equal to P. Therefore, P is not a projection operator. So, it's an observable but not a projection.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are indeed 0, 1, and -1, as I found earlier.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So, when we measure P, we can get 0, 1, or -1.

The state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this state as ψ.

To find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue, we need to project ψ onto the corresponding eigenvector.

But to do that, I need the eigenvectors. Let me try to find them.

First, for λ = 0:

Solve (P - 0I) x = 0, i.e., P x = 0.

So, the system is:

Row 1: 0*x1 + (1/√2)*x2 + 0*x3 = 0 => x2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2)*x1 + 0*x2 + (1/√2)*x3 = 0 => x1 + x3 = 0

Row 3: 0*x1 + (1/√2)*x2 + 0*x3 = 0 => x2 = 0

So, from row 1 and 3, we have x2 = 0. From row 2, x1 = -x3.

So, the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 are of the form (x1, 0, x3) where x1 = -x3. Let me set x3 = t, so x1 = -t. Therefore, the eigenvectors are t*(-1, 0, 1) for any scalar t.

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (-1, 0, 1).

Similarly, I need to find eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1.

Let's do λ=1:

Solve (P - I)x = 0.

Matrix P - I:

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]

[ 0, 1/√2, -1 ]

So, the system is:

- x1 + (1/√2)x2 = 0 --> x1 = (1/√2)x2

(1/√2)x1 - x2 + (1/√2)x3 = 0

(1/√2)x2 - x3 = 0 --> x3 = (1/√2)x2

So, from first equation: x1 = (1/√2)x2

From third equation: x3 = (1/√2)x2

Plug x1 and x3 into the second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2)x2 - x2 + (1/√2)*(1/√2)x2 = 0

Simplify:

(1/2)x2 - x2 + (1/2)x2 = 0

Combine terms:

(1/2 - 1 + 1/2)x2 = (-0)x2 = 0

So, 0 = 0, which is always true.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form ( (1/√2)x2, x2, (1/√2)x2 ). Let me factor out x2:

x2*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional spanned by (1/√2, 1, 1/√2).

Similarly, for λ=-1:

Solve (P + I)x = 0.

Matrix P + I:

[ 1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2]

[ 0, 1/√2, 1 ]

So, the system is:

x1 + (1/√2)x2 = 0 --> x1 = -(1/√2)x2

(1/√2)x1 + x2 + (1/√2)x3 = 0

(1/√2)x2 + x3 = 0 --> x3 = -(1/√2)x2

So, from first equation: x1 = -(1/√2)x2

From third equation: x3 = -(1/√2)x2

Plug into the second equation:

(1/√2)*(-(1/√2)x2) + x2 + (1/√2)*(-(1/√2)x2) = 0

Simplify:

(-1/2)x2 + x2 + (-1/2)x2 = (-1/2 + 1 - 1/2)x2 = 0x2 = 0

So, 0=0, which is always true.

Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=-1 are of the form ( -(1/√2)x2, x2, -(1/√2)x2 ). Factor out x2:

x2*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional spanned by (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2).

So, now we have the three eigenvectors:

For λ=0: v1 = (-1, 0, 1)

For λ=1: v2 = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2)

For λ=-1: v3 = (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2)

Now, these eigenvectors should form an orthonormal basis if P is diagonalizable, which it is since it's Hermitian.

Let me check if they are orthonormal.

First, inner product of v1 and v2:

v1 • v2 = (-1)(1/√2) + (0)(1) + (1)(1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 0

Good.

Inner product of v1 and v3:

v1 • v3 = (-1)(-1/√2) + (0)(1) + (1)(-1/√2) = (1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = 0

Good.

Inner product of v2 and v3:

v2 • v3 = (1/√2)(-1/√2) + (1)(1) + (1/√2)(-1/√2) = (-1/2) + 1 + (-1/2) = (-1/2 -1/2) +1 = -1 +1 = 0

Good, so all eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Now, let's normalize them to make an orthonormal basis.

First, compute the norm of v1:

||v1||² = (-1)² + 0² +1² = 1 +0 +1=2. So, ||v1||=√2. Therefore, the normalized vector is u1 = (1/√2)(-1,0,1) = (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Similarly, norm of v2:

||v2||² = (1/√2)² +1² + (1/√2)² = (1/2) +1 + (1/2) = 2. So, ||v2||=√2. Therefore, u2 = (1/√2)(1/√2,1,1/√2) = (1/2, 1/√2,1/2). Wait, actually, no. Wait, if I normalize v2:

v2 = (1/√2,1,1/√2)

||v2||² = (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2

So, u2 = v2 / ||v2|| = (1/√2,1,1/√2)/√2 = (1/(√2*√2), 1/√2, 1/(√2*√2)) = (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2)

Wait, actually, 1/√2 divided by √2 is 1/(√2*√2) = 1/2. So, yeah, u2 = (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2)

Similarly, for v3:

v3 = (-1/√2,1,-1/√2)

||v3||² = (-1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (-1/√2)^2 = 1/2 +1 +1/2 = 2

So, u3 = v3 / √2 = (-1/(√2*√2), 1/√2, -1/(√2*√2)) = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)

So, now we have the orthonormal eigenvectors:

u1 = (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

u2 = (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2)

u3 = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)

Now, the state vector is ψ = (-1, 2, 1). As I noticed earlier, the norm is √6. So, let me write ψ as a linear combination of u1, u2, u3.

ψ = a u1 + b u2 + c u3

Where a, b, c are the coefficients. Then, the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

But since the eigenvectors are orthonormal, we can compute a, b, c via inner products:

a = ψ • u1

b = ψ • u2

c = ψ • u3

Compute a:

a = (-1, 2, 1) • (-1/√2, 0, 1/√2) = (-1)*(-1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(1/√2) = (1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2

Similarly, compute b:

b = (-1, 2, 1) • (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2) = (-1)*(1/2) + 2*(1/√2) +1*(1/2) = (-1/2) + (2/√2) + (1/2) = (-1/2 +1/2) + (2/√2) = 0 + √2 = √2

Wait, let me compute 2/√2: 2/√2 = √2, yes. So, b = √2

Compute c:

c = (-1, 2, 1) • (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) = (-1)*(-1/2) + 2*(1/√2) +1*(-1/2) = (1/2) + (2/√2) + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + √2 = 0 + √2 = √2

So, a = √2, b = √2, c = √2

Therefore, the state ψ can be written as:

ψ = √2 u1 + √2 u2 + √2 u3

But wait, let's compute the norm of ψ:

||ψ||² = |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = (√2)² + (√2)² + (√2)² = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which matches our previous calculation.

Therefore, the probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², |b|² / ||ψ||², |c|² / ||ψ||².

But wait, actually, no: in quantum mechanics, when we have an orthonormal basis, the probabilities are just |a|², |b|², |c|² if the basis vectors are orthonormal and the state is normalized. But since our state is not normalized, the actual probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², etc.

But let's see:

Wait, actually, in general, if the state is ψ = a u1 + b u2 + c u3, and u1, u2, u3 are orthonormal, then the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|², but only if ψ is normalized. If ψ is not normalized, then the probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², |b|² / ||ψ||², |c|² / ||ψ||².

In our case, ψ is not normalized, but I think the correct probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², etc. Let me confirm.

Yes, because the probabilities are calculated as the squared modulus of the inner product divided by the norm squared. So,

P(λ) = |⟨u|ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||²

But in our case, we decomposed ψ into a linear combination of the orthonormal basis vectors u1, u2, u3, with coefficients a, b, c. So, the probabilities would be |a|² / 6, |b|² /6, |c|² /6.

But wait, let's think in terms of projection. The probability of getting eigenvalue λ is |⟨u_λ | ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||², where u_λ is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to λ.

But in our case, we've already calculated a, b, c as ⟨u1 | ψ⟩, ⟨u2 | ψ⟩, ⟨u3 | ψ⟩, but without normalizing ψ.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's step back.

Given ψ, to find the probability of measuring eigenvalue λ, we compute:

P(λ) = |⟨u_λ | ψ⟩|² / ||ψ||²

where u_λ is the unit eigenvector corresponding to λ.

But in our case, we have:

a = ⟨u1 | ψ⟩ = √2

b = ⟨u2 | ψ⟩ = √2

c = ⟨u3 | ψ⟩ = √2

So, the probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², etc.

So, let's compute them.

Compute |a|²: (√2)^2 = 2

Similarly, |b|² = 2, |c|² = 2

Then, ||ψ||² = 6

So, P(0) = |a|² / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1/3

P(1) = |b|² /6 = 2 /6 =1/3

P(-1) = |c|² /6 = 2 /6 =1/3

Wait, that's strange. So, each probability is 1/3? But the user said the correct answer is 1, meaning that the probability of getting 0 is 1. But according to my calculation, it's 1/3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Maybe my initial decomposition is wrong.

Wait, let's re-express the state ψ in terms of the orthonormal basis.

Given that u1, u2, u3 are orthonormal, the coefficients a, b, c are given by the inner products:

a = ψ • u1

b = ψ • u2

c = ψ • u3

So, let's recalculate:

a = (-1,2,1) • u1 = (-1)(-1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(1/√2) = (1/√2) +0 + (1/√2) = 2/√2 = √2

b = (-1,2,1) • u2 = (-1)(1/2) + (2)(1/√2) + (1)(1/2) = (-1/2) + (2/√2) + (1/2) = [(-1/2 +1/2)] + √2 = 0 + √2 = √2

c = (-1,2,1) • u3 = (-1)(-1/2) + (2)(1/√2) + (1)(-1/2) = (1/2) + (2/√2) + (-1/2) = [1/2 -1/2] + √2 = 0 + √2 = √2

So, a, b, c are all √2. So, when I express ψ as:

ψ = a u1 + b u2 + c u3 = √2 u1 + √2 u2 + √2 u3

But then, the norm squared of ψ is |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = 2 + 2 + 2 =6, which is correct.

Thus, the probabilities are each |a|² /6, |b|² /6, |c|² /6, which are each 1/3.

So, why is the probability of getting 0 equal to 1?

Wait, maybe I misread the matrix P.

Wait, let me check the matrix P again.

The first row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Is that correct? Yes.

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculating the eigenvectors.

Wait, earlier, when I found the eigenvectors, for λ=0, I got v1 = (-1,0,1), right?

But let me think about it. If I plug v1 into P, I should get 0.

Compute P * v1:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 +0*1 = 0

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) +0*0 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (1/√2) = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 +0*1 = 0

So, P*v1 = 0, correct.

Similarly, for v2, which is (1/√2,1,1/√2):

Compute P * v2:

First component:0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(1/√2) = 1/√2

Wait, but it should be λ * v2, which is 1 * (1/√2,1,1/√2). So, first component should be 1/√2, which it is.

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) +0*1 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = (1/2) +0 + (1/2) =1. Which matches.

Third component:0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(1/√2)=1/√2. Which matches.

So, that's correct.

Similarly, for v3, (-1/√2,1,-1/√2):

P * v3:

First component:0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2)=1/√2

But λ is -1, so we should get -1 times v3, which is (1/√2, -1,1/√2). Wait, but we got (1/√2,1,-1/√2). Wait, that's not equal. Wait, maybe I did a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute P*v3:

First component: 0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) = 1/√2

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1/√2) +0*1 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (-1/2) +0 + (-1/2) = -1

Third component:0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) =1/√2

So, P*v3 = (1/√2, -1,1/√2). But v3 is (-1/√2,1,-1/√2). So, it's not equal to -v3, which would be (1/√2, -1,1/√2). Wait, actually, it is equal to -v3.

Wait, v3 is (-1/√2,1,-1/√2). So, -v3 is (1/√2,-1,1/√2), which is equal to P*v3.

So, yes, P*v3 = -v3, so it's correct for λ=-1.

So, the eigenvectors seem to be correctly calculated.

Therefore, the coefficients a, b, c are all √2, so the probabilities are each 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe the initial state is an eigenvector of P. Let me check.

Compute P * ψ:

P * ψ = [0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 +0*1, (1/√2)*(-1) +0*2 + (1/√2)*1, 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 +0*1]

Compute each component:

First component: 0 + 2/√2 +0=2/√2=√2

Second component: (-1)/√2 +0 +1/√2=0

Third component: 0 + 2/√2 +0=2/√2=√2

So, P*ψ = (√2, 0, √2). Which is equal to √2*(1,0,1). Is that equal to λ*ψ for some λ?

ψ is (-1,2,1). So, unless (1,0,1) is proportional to (-1,2,1), which it's not, then ψ is not an eigenvector.

So, ψ is not an eigenvector, so the measurement does not necessarily yield a single eigenvalue with probability 1. So, why does the correct answer say 1?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the measurement. Wait, the user is asking for the probability of getting 0, not any eigenvalue. So, according to my calculation, it's 1/3.

But the correct answer is 1.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the eigenvectors. Let me double-check the eigenvectors for λ=0.

When I solved P*x =0, I got x2=0, x1 = -x3, so the eigenvectors are of the form (-1,0,1). But in my orthonormal basis, u1 was (-1/√2,0,1/√2). So, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the inner product a = ψ • u1, I got √2, which is the same as ψ • v1, since u1 is normalized v1.

But if I compute the projection of ψ onto the eigenspace for λ=0, which is spanned by v1, the projection is (ψ • v1 / ||v1||² ) v1.

But since v1 is not normalized, ||v1||² =2, so the projection is (a /2 ) v1, where a = ψ • v1= 2√2? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, maybe I confused the inner products.

Wait, no, the projection operator onto the eigenspace for λ=0 is P0 = |v1⟩⟨v1| / ||v1||².

But since v1 is not normalized, P0 = (v1 v1†)/(v1† v1). Since v1† v1 =2, and v1 v1† is the outer product.

But maybe another approach is better. Wait, if I project ψ onto the eigenspace for λ=0, the projection is given by:

proj = (ψ • u1) u1, since u1 is the normalized eigenvector.

So, proj = a u1, where a = ψ • u1 = √2.

Thus, proj = √2 u1. Then, the squared norm of proj is |√2|² =2, so the probability is 2 / ||ψ||² =2/6=1/3.

So, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the state ψ is in the eigenspace for λ=0? But no, because when I computed P*ψ, I got (√2, 0, √2), which is not a scalar multiple of ψ. Because ψ is (-1,2,1). So, not the same direction.

Wait, unless...

Wait, hold on, maybe P is a projection operator after all? Because when I computed P², I got:

P² = [ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's not equal to P. So, P² ≠ P. Therefore, P is not a projection operator. So, it's not idempotent.

Therefore, it's not a projection operator, which means that the eigenspace for λ=0 is not the same as the image of P.

So, going back, I think my calculation is correct, that the probability is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back.

The state is given as (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by P with elements in the first row (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row (0, 1/√2, 0). So, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the observable is being measured in the computational basis? Or is it traceless?

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of P is equal to the sum over λ P(λ) λ. So, maybe I can compute the expectation value and see if it's 0 or not.

Compute ⟨ψ| P |ψ⟩.

First, ψ is (-1, 2, 1). So, ψ† is (-1, 2, 1).

Compute ψ† P ψ.

Compute each component:

First component: (-1,2,1) * first column of P.

First column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]. So, (-1)*0 +2*(1/√2) +1*0 = 2/√2 = √2

Second component: (-1,2,1) * second column of P.

Second column of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]. So, (-1)*(1/√2) +2*0 +1*(1/√2) = (-1/√2) +0 +1/√2 =0

Third component: (-1,2,1) * third column of P.

Third column of P: [0, 1/√2, 0]. So, (-1)*0 +2*(1/√2) +1*0 = 2/√2 = √2

So, ψ† P ψ = [√2,0,√2]

Then, multiply by ψ:

√2*(-1) +0*2 +√2*1 = (-√2) +0 +√2=0

So, the expectation value is 0.

But since the eigenvalues are 0,1,-1, the expectation value is 0.

Which can happen if the probabilities for 1 and -1 are equal but opposite, but in our case, each has probability 1/3, so 1/3*1 +1/3*(-1) +1/3*0= (1/3 -1/3) +0=0.

But that doesn't explain why the probability of getting 0 would be 1.

Wait, but if the state is in the eigenspace of λ=0, then the probability is 1, but in our case, the state is not in that eigenspace.

Wait, unless...

Wait, hold on, maybe the operator P has a rank 1, so that only λ=0 and λ=1 or something else.

Wait, earlier, when I computed the eigenvalues, I got 0,1,-1, but if P is traceless, then sum of eigenvalues should be 0. Let me check.

Trace of P is 0 +0 +0=0. So, the sum of eigenvalues is 0. So, 0 +1 +(-1)=0, which matches.

But that doesn't necessarily mean anything for the probabilities.

Wait, unless the matrix P is such that the eigenspace for λ=0 is two-dimensional.

But earlier, I found that eigenspace is one-dimensional, right? Because when solving P x=0, the solution was x2=0, x1=-x3, so one-dimensional.

So, in that case, the projection is 1-dimensional.

Wait,
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at a given time t. The state of the system is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors of the observable. So, if I can find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then I can compute the probability by taking the square of the amplitude of the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

But wait, is P a Hermitian matrix? Because observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices to ensure real eigenvalues and unitary evolution. Let me check the matrix P:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Looking at the matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both 1/√2, which is fine for Hermitian. Similarly, the (2,3) and (3,2) elements are both 1/√2, so that should be okay too. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0, so P is indeed a Hermitian matrix. Good.

Next, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Specifically, I'm interested in the eigenvalue 0 because that's the outcome we're looking for.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant of P - λI.

P - λI = [ [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
           [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
           [0, 1/√2, -λ ] ]

Calculating the determinant:

|P - λI| = -λ * | -λ   1/√2 |
               |1/√2  -λ  |

      - 1/√2 * |1/√2  1/√2|
               |0     -λ  |

      + 0 * something...

Wait, actually, the determinant expansion for a 3x3 matrix is a bit more involved. Let me recall the formula:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:
[ a, b, c ]
[ d, e, f ]
[ g, h, i ]

So applying this to P - λI:

a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0
d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2
g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

Therefore, det(P - λI) = (-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[... terms ...]

Simplify each part:

First term: (-λ)[ λ² - (1/2) ] = -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2)[ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = - ( -λ / 2 ) = λ / 2

Third term is 0.

So combining the first and second terms:

det(P - λI) = (-λ³ + λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

Set det(P - λI) = 0:

-λ³ + λ = 0 => λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 => λ(1 - λ²) = 0

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. That means when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

But the question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the projection of the state onto this eigenvector.

So first, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

So, writing the system of equations:

1. 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

2. (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

3. 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => same as equation 1, so redundant.

So from equation 1: v2 = 0

From equation 2: v1 = -v3

So the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 are all vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Therefore, the eigenvector we're interested in is proportional to (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it.

The norm of (1, 0, -1) is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

We need to compute the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector |v> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

The projection amplitude is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude: |<v|ψ>|² = | -sqrt(2) |² = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me double-check my calculations.

First, the eigenvectors for λ=0: v2=0, v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are (1, 0, -1) scaled. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), as I had earlier.

Then, the state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2). The norm squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But wait, the norm squared is 2, but probabilities can't exceed 1. That suggests that either I messed up the eigenvector, or perhaps the state is not normalized?

Wait, is the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) normalized? Let's check:

||ψ|| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6). So it's not normalized.

Therefore, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the probability is |<v|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of ψ if ψ is not normalized. Alternatively, if we normalize ψ, then the probability is just |<v|ψ_normalized>|².

But let's see:

First, compute |<v|ψ>|²:

We have <v|ψ> = -sqrt(2), so |<v|ψ>|² = 2.

Compute ||ψ||² = 6.

Therefore, the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But the question says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that contradicts my result. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvectors. Maybe I messed up when solving for λ=0.

We had the equations:

From P - 0I:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)*v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, yes, same as before. So v2=0, v1 = -v3. So eigenvectors are (1,0,-1) scaled.

So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product?

Let me compute again:

v = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]

Compute <v|ψ>:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So |<v|ψ>|² = 2. Then, since ψ is not normalized, we have to divide by ||ψ||², which is 6.

Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. That means my approach must be wrong.

Wait, why is the correct answer 1? Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the eigenvalues aren't 0, 1, -1, or perhaps my eigenvectors are incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant of P - λI more carefully.

Earlier, I thought det(P - λI) was -λ³ + λ, but maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Let me recalculate the determinant:

Using the 3x3 determinant formula:

det(P - λI) = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

So:

First term: -λ*(λ² - (1/2))

Second term: - (1/√2)*( -λ/√2 )

Third term: 0

Compute first term: -λ³ + (λ)/2

Second term: - (1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = - ( -λ / 2 ) = λ/2

So total determinant: (-λ³ + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ

So that was correct. So eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, is it possible that the observable P can only take the value 0? But that can't be because the trace of P is 0, and if only 0 was an eigenvalue, the trace would have to be zero, which it is, but P has other eigenvalues as well.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, let's write the system again:

From P v = 0:

Row 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0

Row 3: (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v2 = 0

So, from this, v2=0, v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, as before.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Therefore, the inner product is -sqrt(2), as before.

Wait, so unless the state is already in the eigenvector, which it isn't because it's (-1,2,1). So how is the probability 1?

Alternatively, maybe the observable is being considered as a projection operator. Wait, no, P is an observable, not necessarily a projection operator.

Wait, or perhaps the system is in an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, so the probability is 1. But is (-1,2,1) an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0? Let's check.

Let me compute P * ψ:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T

Compute P*ψ:

First component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (1/√2)*1 = (-1 +1)/√2 = 0

Third component: 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*2 + 0*1 = 2/√2 = sqrt(2)

So P*ψ = [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T

But for an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, we should have P*ψ = 0, which is not the case here. So ψ is not an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, the probability cannot be 1. So why does the user say the correct answer is 1?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the matrix. Wait, is P a 3x3 matrix or a different size? The state is a column vector of size 3, so P must be 3x3, which it is.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the observable P is being measured in a basis where it's diagonal, but since P is tridiagonal, perhaps the state is expressed in the eigenbasis?

Wait, but to compute the probability, we need to express the state in the eigenbasis of P.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the inner product. Let's compute it again.

ψ = [-1, 2, 1]

v = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]

Compute <v|ψ>:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

So |<v|ψ>|² = ( -sqrt(2) )² = 2.

But the norm of ψ is sqrt(6). So the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we are to compute the expectation value, but that's not the question. The question is about the probability of measuring 0.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the expectation value of P^2 or something else? No, the question is clear: probability of getting 0.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the state is being considered as a ket vector, and we need to compute the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So the standard approach is correct: find the eigenvectors, compute the inner product, square it, normalize if necessary.

But in this case, the inner product squared is 2, and the norm squared is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3.

But since the user says the correct answer is 1, maybe I'm misunderstanding the observable.

Wait, maybe the observable is the projection operator onto some subspace, but in the problem statement, P is given as the observable. So unless P is idempotent, which it isn't because P^2 is not equal to P.

Wait, let me compute P^2.

Compute P^2:

First row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0]. Multiply by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Second row of P is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]. Multiply by P:

First element: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Second element: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Third element: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me do it step by step.

Wait, actually, to compute the second row of P^2, we take the second row of P and multiply by each column of P.

Second row of P: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

First column of P: [0; 1/√2; 0]. So dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

Second column of P: [1/√2; 0; 1/√2]. Dot product: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Third column of P: [0; 1/√2; 0]. Dot product: (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0

So second row of P^2 is [0, 1, 0]

Third row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0]. Multiply by P:

First element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2

So third row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2]

Therefore, P^2 = [ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
                [0, 1, 0],
                [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Which is not equal to P, so P is not idempotent. Therefore, it's not a projection operator. So we can't treat it as such.

So going back, I think my initial approach is correct. The probability is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, let's see: The eigenvector is (1,0,-1). The state is (-1,2,1). Let's check if the state is a multiple of the eigenvector.

If we scale the eigenvector by -1, we get (-1,0,1). Comparing to the state (-1,2,1). Hmm, not the same. So the state is not an eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider that the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the probability is |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Which is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

But the user says the answer is 1. Maybe the eigenvector is different?

Wait, maybe I should write the general solution for the eigenvector. When λ=0, the equations are:

v2 = 0

v1 + v3 = 0

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So any vector where the second component is 0, and the first and third components are negatives.

But the state vector is (-1,2,1). Let's see if this is in the eigenspace.

Is 2=0? No. So it's not in the eigenspace. So the projection is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the state is already in the eigenspace? No, because the second component is 2, not 0.

So the projection is non-zero, but the probability is 1/3, not 1.

Wait, unless the observable is being considered differently. Maybe P is a spin operator or something else, but I don't think that changes the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is being measured in the basis where P is diagonal, but I don't think that helps.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is from a different context where the observable P is being considered as a random variable, and the expectation is being calculated, but the question is about probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different observable.

Wait, let me re-express the problem:

State: (-1, 2, 1)

Observable P:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Find probability of measuring 0.

I think the correct approach is to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then compute the projection.

But according to my calculations, the probability is 1/3.

But since the user says the correct answer is 1, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's try to compute the probability another way.

If P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, then the probability of getting 0 is the expectation value of the indicator function for P=0, which is the same as the projection onto the eigenspace.

So another way to compute it is to find the dimension of the eigenspace or something, but in this case, it's one-dimensional.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is orthogonal to the eigenspace.

Wait, the eigenspace is spanned by (1,0,-1). The state is (-1,2,1). The inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. But normalized, it's -sqrt(2). But the norm of the state is sqrt(6).

So the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different basis. Wait, if we change the basis, but I don't think that affects the probability.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the expectation value of P. Let's see:

E[P] = <ψ|P|ψ>

Compute <ψ|P|ψ>:

First, compute P|ψ|:

P|ψ> = [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)] as before.

Then, <ψ|P|ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) * [sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2)]^T = (-1)*sqrt(2) + 2*0 + 1*sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)) = 0.

Wait, the expectation value is 0. Hmm, that's interesting. But that doesn't necessarily mean the probability of getting 0 is 1. It just means that 0 is one of the possible outcomes, and the expectation is 0.

But in this case, the expectation is 0, which could be because the state is orthogonal to the eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues.

Wait, no, that can't be because the state isn't orthogonal to the eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Wait, let me think differently.

If the state was entirely in the eigenspace of 0, then the probability would be 1. But in this case, the state has components outside that eigenspace.

Wait, but if the expectation value is 0, and the other eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but the state isn't entirely in the 0 eigenspace, how does that reconcile?

Wait, perhaps the state is an equal superposition of eigenstates with eigenvalues 1 and -1, such that their contributions cancel out, leading to an expectation value of 0, but the probability of getting 0 is still 1/3.

But in this case, the expectation is 0 because the state has equal parts in 1 and -1, which cancel out, but the 0 component contributes 1/3.

So why does the user say the correct answer is 1?

Alternatively, maybe the state is a linear combination of the eigenvectors with eigenvalues 1 and -1, but not the 0 eigenvalue. But no, since the projection onto 0 is non-zero.

Wait, let's compute the probabilities for eigenvalues 1 and -1 as well, just to check.

First, let's find eigenvectors for λ=1.

Solve (P - I)v = 0:

P - I = [ [-1, 1/√2, 0],
          [1/√2, -1, 1/√2],
          [0, 1/√2, -1] ]

Write the equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = (1/√2) v2

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 - v3 = 0 => v3 = (1/√2) v2

From first equation: v1 = (1/√2) v2

From third equation: v3 = (1/√2) v2

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)(1/√2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2)(1/√2 v2) = (1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/2 v2) = (1/2 + 1/2 -1)v2 = 0*v2 = 0

So the equations are consistent. Therefore, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form (1/√2 v2, v2, 1/√2 v2) = v2*(1/√2, 1, 1/√2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) divided by its norm.

Compute norm: sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2 / sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/√2 / sqrt(2)) = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, actually, let me compute it correctly:

The vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). Its norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2), 1/√2 / sqrt(2)) = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, no, actually, it's (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) divided by sqrt(2):

So (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/2,

1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2),

Similarly, the third component is 1/2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Similarly, for λ=-1, the eigenvectors will be similar but with a sign change.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=-1.

Solve (P + I)v = 0:

P + I = [ [1, 1/√2, 0],
          [1/√2, 1, 1/√2],
          [0, 1/√2, 1] ]

Write the equations:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 = 0 => v1 = - (1/√2) v2

(1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0

(1/√2) v2 + v3 = 0 => v3 = - (1/√2) v2

Substitute into second equation:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = (-1/2 v2) + v2 + (-1/2 v2) = (-1/2 + 1 -1/2)v2 = 0*v2 = 0

So consistent. Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=-1 are of the form (-1/√2 v2, v2, -1/√2 v2) = v2*(-1/√2, 1, -1/√2). Normalizing:

Norm: sqrt( ( -1/√2 )^2 + 1^2 + ( -1/√2 )^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2 ) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

Now, we have three eigenvectors:

For λ=0: (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

For λ=1: (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)

For λ=-1: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)

Now, we can express the state ψ = (-1, 2, 1) as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.

Let me denote the eigenvectors as:

v0 = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))

v1 = (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2)

v-1 = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)

We need to find coefficients a, b, c such that:

a*v0 + b*v1 + c*v-1 = ψ

But since the eigenvectors are orthogonal (because P is Hermitian), we can find the coefficients by taking inner products.

So:

a = <v0|ψ>

b = <v1|ψ>

c = <v-1|ψ>

Compute each:

First, a = <v0|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)

Similarly, b = <v1|ψ> = (1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + (2/sqrt(2)) + (1/2) = ( -1/2 + 1/2 ) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Similarly, c = <v-1|ψ> = (-1/2)*(-1) + (1/sqrt(2))*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + (2/sqrt(2)) + (-1/2) = (1/2 -1/2) + sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Therefore, the coefficients are:

a = -sqrt(2)

b = sqrt(2)

c = sqrt(2)

Now, the probabilities are |a|² / ||ψ||², |b|² / ||ψ||², |c|² / ||ψ||².

Compute ||ψ||² = (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6.

Compute |a|² = ( -sqrt(2) )² = 2

|b|² = ( sqrt(2) )² = 2

|c|² = ( sqrt(2) )² = 2

So total probabilities:

P(0) = 2/6 = 1/3

P(1) = 2/6 = 1/3

P(-1) = 2/6 = 1/3

Therefore, each eigenvalue has equal probability of 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the state is being normalized differently? Let me check.

The state ψ is (-1,2,1). Its norm is sqrt(6). So if we normalize it, we get ψ_normalized = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Then, the inner product with v0 is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3)

Therefore, the probability is | -1/sqrt(3) |² = 1/3.

Same result.

So unless I'm missing some key insight, the probability should be 1/3, not 1.

But the user says the correct answer is 1. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe P is being treated as a measurement operator in a different way, such as rank-1 measurement. But in that case, P would have to be a projection matrix, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the expectation value being 0, but that's different from the probability.

Alternatively, maybe the state is orthogonal to the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalues 1 and -1, making the probability of measuring 0 to be 1. But in reality, the inner products are non-zero.

Wait, let's compute the inner products again.

From earlier:

a = <v0|ψ> = -sqrt(2)

b = <v1|ψ> = sqrt(2)

c = <v-1|ψ> = sqrt(2)

So the state is a combination of all three eigenvectors, each contributing a non-zero component. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

But the user says the correct answer
