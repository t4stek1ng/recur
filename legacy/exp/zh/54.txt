There is a multiple-choice question: Under ideal conditions, the electric and magnetic fields inside a superconductor are zero. Maxwell’s equations imply that which of the following must be true just outside the surface of the superconductor?. The options are: A. B = 0, B. B is perpendicular to the surface., C. B is tangential to the surface., D. B is time independent.. Why the correct answer is: D. B is time independent.?
