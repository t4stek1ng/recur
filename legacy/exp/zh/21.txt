There is a multiple-choice question: Let P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself (i.e., is recursive). If P is guaranteed to terminate, which of the following statements must be true?
I. P has a local variable.
II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.
III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.. The options are: A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. II and III only. Why the correct answer is: A. I only?
