There is a multiple-choice question: Under which of the following situations would bootstrapping be preferred to pure simulation?

i) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment

are the same as those of some actual data


ii) If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment

are known exactly


iii) If the distributional properties of the actual data are unknown


iv) If the sample of actual data available is very small. The options are: A. (ii) and (iv) only, B. (i) and (iii) only, C. (i), (ii), and (iv) only, D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). Why the correct answer is: D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)?
