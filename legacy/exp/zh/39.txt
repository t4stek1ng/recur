There is a multiple-choice question: Consider an object-oriented language in which all entities are objects. Two relationships arise: (1) the instance relationship, between an object and the class of which that object is a member, and (2) the subclass relationship, between a class and the superclass from which that class inherits properties. In such a language, when a message is sent to an object requesting execution of one of its methods (procedures), the method is located by following. The options are: A. one instance link and then zero or more subclass links, B. one or more instance links and then one or more subclass links, C. one or more instance links, D. one subclass link and then one or more instance links. Why the correct answer is: C. one or more instance links?
