There is a multiple-choice question: Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?. The options are: A. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, B. The Pauli exclusion principle, C. The Bohr model of the atom, D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling. Why the correct answer is: D. Nuclear hyperfine coupling?
