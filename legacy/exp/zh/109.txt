Observations of a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum are being carried out. Focusing on the near infrared and optical spectrum, there is a peak at wavelength of about 790 nm, and at shorter wavelengths < 790 nm the flux drops significantly.

If we lived in a universe defined by Lambda-CDM model such that the current Hubble constant is 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy density parameter is 0.7, and universe is flat,
what can be assumed about the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth? Why the correct answer is: 6 Gpc?
