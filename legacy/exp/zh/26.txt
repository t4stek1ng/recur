There is a multiple-choice question: Let M be a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with tape alphabet {blank,0,1}, and let C denote the (possibly infinite) computation of M starting with a blank tape. The input to each problem below is M, together with a positive integer n. Which of the following problems is (are) decidable?
I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.
II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.
III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.. The options are: A. None, B. III only, C. I and II only, D. I and III only. Why the correct answer is: A. None?
