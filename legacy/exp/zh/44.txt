There is a multiple-choice question: White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is. The options are: A. 500 nm, B. 550 nm, C. 600 nm, D. 650 nm. Why the correct answer is: A. 500 nm?
