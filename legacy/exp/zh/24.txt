There is a multiple-choice question: Assume that any assignment statement can be executed in unit time. If as many identical processors as needed are used, what is the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments
A := B + C
B := A - B
C := A * E
D := A/F
E := B - C
F := A + B
with the same result as if the assignments were executed in the order shown?. The options are: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. Why the correct answer is: B. 2?
