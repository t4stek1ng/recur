There is a multiple-choice question: Light of variable frequency shines on the metal surface of a photoelectric tube. Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the. The options are: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency, B. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength, C. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength, D. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. Why the correct answer is: A. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency?
