[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is ψ = 1/√3*(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, find the expectation value of E. The answer is supposedly it's not an eigenstate with an expectation value of (3/4)*A*hbar². Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I recall that for spin systems, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed using the formula S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i + S_j)² - (1/2)S_i² - (1/2)S_j². So, maybe I can use this identity to rewrite the Hamiltonian in a more manageable form.

But before that, let me note that each S_i is a vector operator with components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. For spin 1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of S_i² are (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ², right? So each S_i² has eigenvalue (3/4)ħ².

Wait, but since we're dealing with a system of three particles, maybe I can think about the total spin. Let's define S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, the square of the total spin is S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, I get S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). That means that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, plugging this into the Hamiltonian, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ) = (A/2)*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²).

Hmm, that might be useful. So, H is proportional to S² minus the sum of the squares. Since S² is the total spin squared, which can take on eigenvalues S(S+1)ħ², where S is the total spin.

So, if the state is an eigenstate of S², then it might be an eigenstate of H. But I don't know if ψ is an eigenstate of S². Let me check.

Looking at ψ, it's given as (1/√3)(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃). Each term in the sum has two spin-ups and one spin-down. Let's compute the total spin S² for this state.

But first, perhaps I should figure out the total spin S² and S_z. Each term in ψ is a product state with S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ for each term. So, each term has S_z = 1/2 ħ. Since the state is a symmetric combination of these, the total S_z is (1/3)*(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ.

So, the state ψ has S_z = 1/2 ħ. So, it's a state with total spin projection 1/2.

But is it an eigenstate of S²? For that, the state needs to be a singlet or triplet state with respect to the total spin.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins S can be 3/2 or 1/2. So, for S=3/2, we have multiplets with M_S = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. For S=1/2, we have M_S = 1/2, -1/2.

Given that ψ has S_z = 1/2, it's possible that it's part of the S=1/2 multiplet. Let me check whether it's symmetric under the exchange of particles. The state ψ is symmetric? Let's see.

Looking at ψ, each term is a permutation of the spins, with two up and one down. So, it's symmetric in the sense that swapping any two particles doesn't change the state because all the terms are similar. Wait, actually, each term is a product state with two spins up and one down, but the position of the down spin is different in each term. So, the entire state is symmetric under permutation of particles because all the terms are symmetric. So, it's a symmetric state.

For three spin 1/2 particles, symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2. But our state has M_S=1/2, so it's either the highest weight state of S=3/2 or the lowest weight state of S=1/2. Let me figure out which one.

Wait, the highest weight state for S=3/2 is |3/2, 3/2⟩, which would have all spins up. But our state is more balanced with two up and one down. The state ψ is actually the same as the state |1/2, 1/2⟩ for three spin 1/2 particles. Because |1/2, 1/2⟩ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down.

Yes, in fact, the state ψ is known as the symmetric spin state with S=1/2 and M_S=1/2. So, it is an eigenstate of the total spin S² and Sz.

Therefore, it is an eigenstate of H because H is expressed in terms of S². So, ψ is an eigenstate of H.

Great, so now let's compute the energy. From earlier, H = (A/2)*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²). Since ψ is an eigenstate of S², and each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², as each spin is 1/2.

So, H = (A/2)*(S(S+1)ħ² - 3*(3/4)ħ²). Since S=1/2, S(S+1)= (1/2)(3/2)= 3/4. Therefore,

H = (A/2)*( (3/4)ħ² - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) = (A/2)*( (3/4 - 9/4 ) ħ² ) = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ²) = (A/2)*(-3/2 ħ²) = (-3A/4) ħ².

Wait, that seems contradictory because the expected energy is positive 3/4 A ħ², according to the given answer. Hmm, so I must have messed up the sign somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2 ). So, that's correct.

So, S² is  ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So, substituting:

H = (A/2)*( (3/4)ħ² - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) = (A/2)*( (3/4 - 9/4 ) ħ² ) = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ² ) = (-3A/4) ħ².

Wait, so H is negative? But the expected value is positive 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, perhaps I have a sign error in the way I defined H. Let me check the original problem.

Wait, the problem says H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, that's correct. Hmm, but in my calculation, with S=1/2, I get a negative energy, but maybe I should have considered the eigenvalue as positive.

Wait, but S² is (S(S+1)) ħ². For S=1/2, that's (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So, S² is positive, but when subtracting the sum of S1² + S2² + S3², which is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ², so S² - sum S_i² is 3/4 - 9/4 = -6/4, which is negative. So, H is negative.

But in the given answer, the expectation value is positive. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the state ψ is not the only eigenstate? Or maybe I should compute the expectation value directly.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that S² is (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ². Wait, no, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=3/2 or S=1/2. For S=1/2, the eigenvalue is indeed (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But then H is (A/2)*(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ²) = (-3A/4)ħ². So, eigenvalue is negative, but the expectation value is positive. There must be something wrong here.

Wait, unless I miscalculated the eigenvalue for H.

Wait, another way to compute H is to note that S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is equal to (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. So, H is A*(S² - sum S_i²)/2.

But for each S_i², it's (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So, yes, that part is correct.

Wait, but substituting S²= 3/4 ħ², H = A*( (3/4 ħ² - 3*(3/4 ħ²) ) / 2 ) = A*( (-9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ) = A*(-9/8) ħ². Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, wait, S² is (3/4)ħ², sum S_i² is 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ². So, S² - sum S_i² = (3/4 - 9/4)ħ² = -6/4 ħ² = -3/2 ħ². Then, H = A*(-3/2 ħ²)/2 = (-3A/4) ħ². So, same result.

Hmm, so if H is negative, but the expectation value is positive, that suggests that perhaps I should have considered the opposite sign for H? Or maybe the definition of H is different.

Wait, let's see. The problem says H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, that's positive. Hmm. Maybe I need to compute the expectation value of H instead of Hψ.

Wait, if ψ is an eigenstate, then Hψ = Eψ, so E = (-3A/4)ħ². But the given answer is 3/4 A ħ², so positive. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute it again:

S² = S(S + 1) ħ² = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

sum S_i² = 3*( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² ) = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Thus, S² - sum S_i² = (3/4 - 9/4) ħ² = (-6/4) ħ² = (-3/2) ħ².

Then, H = A*(S² - sum S_i²)/2 = A*(-3/2 ħ²)/2 = A*(-3/4) ħ².

Hmm, that's definitely what I get.

But the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ². So, perhaps I did a miscalculation in defining H.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is that S2 is the sum of the individual S_i operators, so perhaps I should compute H in terms of total spin.

Wait, but no, H is given as the sum of the pairwise dot products. So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Wait, but let me think about the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 in the given state ψ.

Perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly, rather than going through Hψ. That might give me the correct result.

So, let me compute the expectation value <ψ|H|ψ> = A*(<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + <ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + <ψ|S2·S3|ψ>).

Since H is symmetric, all the cross terms should be the same. So, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3>, so the total expectation value is 3*A*<S1·S2>.

Therefore, I can compute <S1·S2> for ψ and multiply by 3A.

Now, S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (1/2)(S1² + S2²). So, the expectation value is (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (1/2)(<S1²> + <S2²>).

Compute each term:

First, compute <(S1 + S2)^2>. Since S1 and S2 are spin operators, (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>.

But wait, we can rearrange this:

Let me denote <S1·S2> = X. Then, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2X.

So, from that equation, 2X = <(S1 + S2)^2> - <S1²> - <S2²>.

So, X = ( <(S1 + S2)^2> - <S1²> - <S2²> ) / 2.

Therefore, if I can compute <(S1 + S2)^2>, then I can find X.

So, let's compute <(S1 + S2)^2> for the state ψ.

First, expand (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>.

But since S1² and S2² are diagonal in the computational basis, their expectation values are just the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues for each particle.

Each spin 1/2 particle has S² = (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So, <S1²> = 3/4 ħ², same for <S2²>.

Thus, <(S1 + S2)^2> = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2X = 3/2 ħ² + 2X.

Wait, but now this seems circular because X is what we're trying to find. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), maybe I can compute the expectation value of each S_i·S_j.

Let me consider S_i·S_j in the state ψ. Each S_i·S_j is (1/2)(S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z).

So, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of each component.

Wait, but perhaps an even better approach is to use the fact that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be computed using the total spin.

Recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i² - S_j² ) / 2.

So, for two particles, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> is [ <(S_i + S_j)^2> - <S_i²> - <S_j²> ] / 2.

Similarly, as before.

But given that I don't know <(S_i + S_j)^2>, perhaps I can compute it directly.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles in the state |↑↑⟩, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is ( (1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)² ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². But for two spin 1/2 particles in a singlet state |↑↓ - ↓↑⟩, the expectation value is negative ( -3/4 ħ² ). Wait, no, actually, for singlet state, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is - (3/4) ħ².

Wait, but in our case, each term in ψ is a product state with two up and one down. So, the state ψ is a symmetric combination of such product states.

Wait, but when considering two particles at a time, for each pair, the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Wait, maybe let's consider the three terms in ψ: |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩, |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩, |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩.

Let me compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in each term and then average.

In the first term, S1·S2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩ is (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ², but actually, S_i·S_j is an operator, so let's compute <↑↑↓ | S1·S2 | ↑↑↓ >.

Wait, S1·S2 = (1/4)(2S1·S2 + S1·S2 ), no, that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each term.

For |↑↑↓⟩, S1·S2 = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ², but actually, wait: S1·S2 is a scalar product, so for |↑↑⟩, S1·S2 is (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Wait, but that's the expectation value for a single term. However, in the state ψ, the state is a symmetric combination of three terms. So, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that when the state is symmetric, the expectation value can be computed using the sum over the terms.

Wait, another approach: compute the total spin singlet for two particles.

Wait, perhaps think about the state ψ as a combination of the triplet and singlet states for two spins.

Wait, each term in ψ is |↑↑↓⟩. So, the state ψ is a combination of three states where each has two up and one down.

Wait, actually, in the space of three particles, ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. So, perhaps it's a symmetric state with well-defined total spin.

Wait, but if it's a state with two up and one down, the total spin is 1/2.

Wait, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 for ψ.

Let me write ψ as (|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩)/√3.

So, ψ is a symmetric combination of these three states.

So, to compute <ψ| S1·S2 |ψ>, we can write it as (1/3) [ <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> + ... etc. ].

But this seems complicated because there are multiple terms. Maybe a better approach is to use the fact that S1·S2 is ( (S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2² ) / 2.

So, compute <(S1 + S2)^2> and subtract <S1²> + <S2²>, then divide by 2.

So, since ψ is a symmetric state, maybe it's an eigenstate of (S1 + S2)^2.

Wait, but I think I need to compute <(S1 + S2)^2> for ψ.

Let me recall that S1 + S2 is a vector operator, so (S1 + S2)^2 is a scalar operator.

Compute <ψ | (S1 + S2)^2 | ψ>.

Expand (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

So, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>.

We know that <S1²> = <S2²> = (3/4) ħ², as each is a spin 1/2.

Therefore, <(S1 + S2)^2> = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> = 3/2 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>.

Thus, <S1·S2> = ( <(S1 + S2)^2> - 3/2 ħ² ) / 2.

So, to compute <S1·S2>, I need to compute <(S1 + S2)^2> in state ψ.

Compute <ψ | (S1 + S2)^2 | ψ>.

Since (S1 + S2)^2 is a scalar, we can compute this expectation value.

Expand it as <ψ | S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2 | ψ> = <ψ | S1² | ψ> + <ψ | S2² | ψ> + 2 <ψ | S1·S2 | ψ> = 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>.

So, <(S1 + S2)^2> = 3/2 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>.

But that's the same as before, so it's circular.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that (S1 + S2)^2 is the operator that measures the total spin squared for particles 1 and 2. Since our state ψ is a symmetric state, which is part of the total spin 1/2 multiplet, the eigenvalue for (S1 + S2)^2 would be (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

Wait, is this true? Because ψ is a state with total spin 1/2, but does (S1 + S2)^2 have eigenvalue 3/4 ħ²?

Wait, (S1 + S2)^2 is part of the total spin for particles 1 and 2. If the state is part of a total spin 1/2, then actually, (S1 + S2)^2 would have an eigenvalue of (S1 + S2)(S1 + S2 +1) ħ², where S1 + S2 is either 1 or 0 for two spin 1/2 particles.

But in our case, ψ is a three-particle state. So, (S1 + S2) is a vector operator, not a scalar. So, perhaps the approach isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe think of ψ as a singlet for three particles. Wait, no, it's a symmetric state with two up and one down.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to note that the state ψ can be rewritten in terms of the total spin basis.

For three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin states are either S=3/2 or S=1/2. The state ψ is the S=1/2, M=1/2 state.

So, if ψ is an eigenstate of S², which is S(S+1) ħ², then we can use that.

So, going back, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = (A/2)*(S² - sum S_i²).

Therefore, since ψ is an eigenstate of S², Hψ = (A/2)*(S² - sum S_i²) ψ = (A/2)*(S(S+1)ħ² - 3*(3/4)ħ² ) ψ.

So, S=1/2, so S(S+1) = 1/2 * 3/2 = 3/4.

Thus, Hψ = (A/2)*( (3/4)ħ² - (9/4)ħ² ) ψ = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ²) ψ = ( -3A/4 ) ħ² ψ.

Wait, so the eigenvalue is negative. But the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, so something's not matching here.

Wait, but the expectation value is positive, so perhaps I should take the absolute value? Or maybe the problem defines H with a negative sign.

Wait, let me re-examine the original problem statement: H is given as A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, it's positive A times that sum.

But when I compute, I get a negative energy. So, possibly, if the state is not an eigenstate, then we have to compute the expectation value, which may not be equal to the eigenvalue.

Wait, but earlier I thought ψ is an eigenstate of S², which would make it an eigenstate of H.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining whether ψ is an eigenstate of S².

Wait, the state ψ is a symmetric state with two spin-ups and one spin-down, which is indeed the state |1/2, 1/2⟩ for three spin 1/2 particles. So, it's an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

So, it should be an eigenstate of H.

But then, why does H have a negative eigenvalue? Or perhaps the problem is in my calculation.

Wait, let me compute Hψ again.

Hψ = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ψ.

If ψ is |1/2, 1/2⟩, then is (S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) proportional to S² - sum S_i².

So, since S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Thus, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

So, Hψ = (A/2)*(S² - sum S_i²) ψ = (A/2)*( (3/4)ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) ψ = (A/2)*(-6/4 ħ²) ψ = (-3A/4) ħ² ψ.

So, it's negative. But in the given answer, it's positive 3/4 A ħ². So, is the given answer incorrect? Or maybe I misapplied the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the definition of H is H = -A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), but the problem says H = A*(...). So, no.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value differently. Maybe I should compute it as:

E = <ψ|H|ψ> = A*( <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> + <ψ|S1·S3|ψ> + <ψ|S2·S3|ψ> )

But since H is symmetric, all three terms are equal, so E = 3*A <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>.

Therefore, compute <S1·S2>. Let's do that.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)( <S1^x S2^x> + <S1^y S2^y> + <S1^z S2^z> ).

Compute each component:

First, <S1^z S2^z>. In the state ψ, each term has two up and one down. So, S1^z is spin-up for some terms, spin-down for others.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value in each term.

Given ψ = (|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩)/√3.

Compute <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (1/3) [ <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↑↓> + <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↑↓↑> + <↑↑↓|S1·S2|↓↑↑> + ... and so on for all cross terms ].

Wait, this seems complicated, but maybe manageable.

First, let's note that S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z).

Let me compute each term.

First, <↑↑↓| S1^z S2^z |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Similarly, <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(1/2) (|↑↑↓> )? Wait, S^x acts as (|↑><↓| + |↓><↑| ) / 2.

Wait, but when acting on |↑↑↓>, S1^x S2^x will flip both spins? No, because S1^x acts on particle 1 and S2^x acts on particle 2.

So, S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> = ( S1^x |↑> ) ⊗ ( S2^x |↑> ) = ( |↓> /√2 ) ⊗ ( |↓> /√2 ) = |↓↓> / 2.

Similarly, <↑↑↓| S1^x S2^x |↑↑↓> = <↑↑↓| ↓↓> / 2 = 0.

Similarly, the same for S1^y S2^y: since it's S1^y S2^y, acting on |↑↑↓> would give zero when sandwiched with <↑↑↓|.

Wait, actually, S1^y |↑> = i |↓>, and S1^y |↓> = -i |↑>, so S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> = (i |↓> ) ⊗ (i |↓> ) = -|↓↓>.

Then, <↑↑↓| S1^y S2^y |↑↑↓> = <↑↑↓| (-|↓↓> ) = 0.

So, the expectation value of S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y in the |↑↑↓> state is zero.

Therefore, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = (1/4) ħ².

Similarly, compute <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑>.

First, S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑> + S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑> + S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑>.

Compute each term:

S1^x S2^x |↑↓↑> = (|↓> /√2 ) ⊗ ( |↑> /√2 ) = |↓↑> / 2.

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |↑↓↑> = (i |↓> ) ⊗ (i |↑> ) = (i)(i) |↓↑> = (-1)|↓↑>.

And S1^z S2^z |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(-1/2) ħ² |↑↓↑> = (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑>.

Thus, S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = (|↓↑> / 2 + (-1)|↓↑> + (-1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑> ).

Therefore, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = <↑↑↓| ( |↓↑> / 2 - |↓↑> - (1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑> ).

Compute each term:

<↑↑↓| |↓↑> = 0, since |↑↑↓> and |↓↑> are orthogonal.

<↑↑↓| ( - (1/2) |↓↑> ) = 0.

<↑↑↓| ( - (1/4) ħ² |↑↓↑> ) = 0, because |↑↑↓> and |↑↓↑> are orthogonal.

Therefore, <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = 0.

Similarly, compute <↑↑↓| S1·S2 |↓↑↑>.

Similarly, S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑> + S1^y S2^y |↓↑↑> + S1^z S2^z |↓↑↑>.

Compute each term:

S1^x S2^x |↓↑↑
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant, and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what the energy is, or if not, what the expectation value of E is.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties of spin-1/2 particles and their Hamiltonians. The spin operators S1, S2, S3 are vectors, and their dot product S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. So, if I can relate H to the total spin squared operator, maybe that can help.

Given that, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ] ). Let me compute that:

H = A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2) + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2) + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2) ] / 2 )

Simplify the numerator:

= A*( [ 3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2 )

So, H = (3A*S_total^2 - 2A*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2.

But wait, since each particle is spin-1/2, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

Thus, plugging that back into H:

H = (3A*S_total^2 - 2A*(9/4)ħ²) / 2

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out the constants.

Let me denote S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, rearranged:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2

Which is what I had earlier.

So, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2 )

So, H = (A/2)*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ² )

So, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8)A ħ².

Interesting. Therefore, H can be written as H = c*S_total^2 + d, where c and d are constants. Thus, if the state is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it will be an eigenstate of H.

So, the key question is: is psi an eigenstate of S_total^2?

If psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it's an eigenstate of H. Otherwise, it's not.

So, let me think about the state psi. It is given as (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). Let me analyze this state.

Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total spin S_z is 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, the state has total spin S_z = 1/2. So, does that mean it's part of the triplet space?

Wait, but wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. Because adding three 1/2 spins: the maximum is 3/2, and the minimum is 1/2.

So, the state psi is in the S=1/2 subspace.

So, is psi an eigenstate of S_total^2? Let's see.

To find out, perhaps it's useful to consider the eigenstates of S_total^2 for S=1/2.

For spin 1/2, the eigenvalues of S_total^2 are S(S+1)ħ² = (1/2)(3/2)ħ² = 3/4 ħ².

But does psi have this eigenvalue?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S_total^2 acting on psi and see if it's proportional to psi.

Alternatively, another approach: note that H can be written as (A/2)(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²). So, the eigenstates of H are the same as the eigenstates of S_total^2, which are the states with definite S and M.

Given that, if the state psi has S=1/2, then it is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 3/4 ħ², so it's an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but wait. Wait, is that correct? Because S_total^2 can have eigenvalues for each state. If psi is in the S=1/2 subspace, then S_total^2 psi = (3/4 ħ²) psi.

Thus, H psi = (A/2)(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²) psi = (A/2)(- 6/4 ħ² ) psi = (-3/4 A ħ²) psi.

So, that would mean psi is an eigenstate of H with energy -3/4 A ħ².

But wait, in the given answer, the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². So, if I'm right, the state is an eigenstate with eigenvalue -3/4 A ħ², but the answer says expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, that suggests maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check.

Wait, H = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²). So, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue (3/4)ħ², then H psi = (A/2)(3/4 - 9/4) ħ² psi = (A/2)(-6/4) ħ² psi = (-3/4 A ħ²) psi. So, the energy is negative.

But in the given answer, the expectation value is positive 3/4 A ħ². So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me check S_total^2. Yes, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, S_total^2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) + 2*(sum of dot products). So, that gives S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2)/2. So, that's correct.

Therefore, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2)/2 ). Since sum S_i^2 is 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ², so H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 ). So that's (A/2)*S_total^2 - (9/8)A ħ². So, that's correct.

Thus, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, say with eigenvalue s(s+1)ħ², then H psi = (A/2)(s(s+1)ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) psi.

So, in our case, the state psi has s=1/2. So, H psi = (A/2)( (1/2)(3/2) - 9/4 ) ħ² psi = (A/2)( (3/4 - 9/4) ) ħ² psi = (A/2)(-6/4) ħ² psi = (-3/4 A ħ² ) psi.

Therefore, the energy is negative 3/4 A ħ². So, if psi is an eigenstate, it's an eigenstate with energy -3/4 A ħ².

But wait, the given correct answer is expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². That suggests that either the state isn't an eigenstate, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps my assumption that psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 is incorrect. Maybe psi is not an eigenstate.

Wait, how can I check that?

Let me compute S_total^2 acting on psi. If it's an eigenstate, it'll just scale psi.

Given that S_total = S1 + S2 + S3, so S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

Let me compute S_total^2 acting on psi.

Given that psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

Let me denote each basis state as |abc⟩ where a, b, c are the spins of particles 1,2,3.

So, S_total^2 |abc⟩ = ( (S1 + S2 + S3) )^2 |abc⟩.

But that's equivalent to (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) ) |abc⟩.

But that might not be straightforward to compute. Alternatively, since each term in psi has two up and one down, maybe I can find the action of S_total^2 on each term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of total spin. Since each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down, the total spin S_z is 1/2. So, M = 1/2. So, perhaps the eigenstates of S_total^2 in the S=1/2 subspace can be written as combinations of states with M=1/2, -1/2.

Wait, but in our case, all terms in psi have M=1/2, so perhaps it's not an eigenstate. Because if it were, it should be a combination of |S, M⟩ states with same M.

Wait, actually, if the state has M=1/2, and it's an eigenstate of S_total^2, then it must be |S, M⟩. But let me recall that for spin-1/2 systems, the states with M=1/2 can only have S=1/2.

Wait, no, wait. For three spin-1/2 particles, the maximum M is 3/2, but the state psi is in the S=1/2 subspace, which has M=1/2 and M=-1/2.

Wait, so for S=1/2, the states are |1/2, 1/2⟩, |1/2, -1/2⟩.

So, if psi is a linear combination of these two, but in our case, psi is a linear combination of three different basis states, all with M=1/2. So, that suggests that psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, because its M is 1/2, but it's a combination of different states within the same M, which aren't necessarily colinear.

Wait, but how can that be? Let me think. If all the terms in psi have M=1/2, but the total spin S is 1/2, then the state should be expressible as |1/2, 1/2⟩. But in reality, |1/2, 1/2⟩ is |↑↑↑⟩. However, our psi is a combination of states with two ups and one down. So, is psi equal to |1/2, 1/2⟩? No, because that would have all spins up.

Wait, maybe I need to find the states |1/2, 1/2⟩ and |1/2, -1/2⟩ for three spins.

Wait, actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states are different. The singlet state is antisymmetric and has S=0, while the triplet states have S=1 with M=1,0,-1.

But wait, we have three particles, so the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Hmm, I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, perhaps the state psi is in the S=1/2 subspace. So, it's a combination of states with S=1/2, M=1/2 and M=-1/2.

Wait, perhaps I can express psi in terms of these states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the action of S_total^2 on psi.

So, let me compute S_total^2 psi.

Given that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, let me compute S_total^2 acting on each term in psi.

First, let me recall that S_i^2 |a b c⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |a b c⟩, since each S_i^2 acts on each spin.

Similarly, S_i·S_j |a b c⟩ = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_total^2) |a b c⟩. Wait, but that's more circular.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for spin-1/2 particles, the dot product operator S_i·S_j can be written as ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

So, S_i·S_j |a b c⟩ = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2 |a b c⟩.

So, let's compute S_i·S_j for each pair.

But let me proceed term by term.

First, take each term in psi: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Let me compute S_total^2 acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = [S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)] |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute each part:

S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩

Similarly, S2^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩

S3^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩

So, sum of squares: 3*(3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ = (9/4) ħ² |↑↑↓⟩.

Now, compute 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩.

First, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

But S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2), where S_total_12 = S1 + S2.

Similarly, S1·S3 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S3^2 - S_total_13^2).

And S2·S3 = (1/2)(S2^2 + S3^2 - S_total_23^2).

Wait, let's compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Since |↑↑↓⟩ is a product state, S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z).

So, S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S1_z S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

For S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y, those are raising and lowering operators.

But in the state |↑↑↓⟩, acting with S1_x on the first spin and S2_x on the second.

Note that S_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|→⟩, which is (1/2)|↓⟩ - (1/2)i|↑⟩? Wait, no, actually, S_x is (ħ/2)(|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|).

Wait, yes, S_x = (ħ/2)( |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ), and similarly for S_y.

So, S1_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)( |↓⟩ ) ⊗ |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, S1_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(i|↓⟩ - i|↑⟩ ) ⊗ |↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(i|↓↑↓⟩ - i|↑↑↓⟩).

Similarly, S2_y |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)(i|↑↓↑⟩ - i|↑↑↓⟩).

So, the cross terms S1_x S2_x and S1_y S2_y acting on |↑↑↓⟩ would produce terms like |↓↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, and so on.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, perhaps we can compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2) |↑↑↓⟩.

But S1^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩, similarly for S2^2.

Thus, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² ) - S_total_12^2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

S_total_12^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

So, S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² ) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/2 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2 S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, rearranged, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( (3/2 ħ² ) - S_total_12^2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

But that's not helpful. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the total spin.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (S=0) is antisymmetric, and the triplet states (S=1) are symmetric.

But in our case, the state psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, it's symmetric under exchange of any two spins, since swapping any two spins doesn't change the state.

Wait, for example, swapping particle 1 and 2: |↑↑↓⟩ becomes |↑↑↓⟩, same as before. Similarly for others.

Thus, psi is symmetric under permutations of spins. Therefore, it's in the S=1 subspace or S=3/2 subspace?

Wait, no. For three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states have S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, because the symmetric states can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2. Let me think.

Yes, for three spin-1/2 particles, symmetric states can have S=3/2 or S=1/2. Because the overall symmetry is symmetric, which can correspond to either S=3/2 (irreducible representation) or S=1/2 (another symmetric representation). So, our state psi is symmetric, so it's in the symmetric subspace, which includes S=3/2 and S=1/2.

But is it in S=3/2 or S=1/2?

Well, let's check the number of states. The symmetric subspace has dimension 6: triplet (S=1) with M=1,0,-1, which is three states, and the S=3/2 subspace with M=3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2, which is four states. So, wait, total symmetric states: 3 + 4 =7? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, for three spins: total Hilbert space is 2^3=8 dimensions.

Symmetric subspace is the set of symmetric states under permutation of spins, which has dimension 4, since the antisymmetric subspace (the singlet state) has dimension 1, so symmetric subspace is 8 - 1 =7? No, wait, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state (S=0) is one state, and the triplets (S=1) are three states, and the quintet (S=3/2) is four states. So, total 1 + 3 + 4=8, which matches 2^3.

But for symmetric states: the singlet is antisymmetric, and the triplet and quintet are symmetric.

So, symmetric states are the triplet (three states) and quintet (four states), total 7 symmetric states, and one antisymmetric state.

So, our state psi is in the symmetric subspace. So, it can be in either S=1 or S=3/2.

Wait, but in our case, psi has all three terms with two up and one down. Let me see if these can be combined into either the triplet or the quintet.

Wait, the triplet states for three spins: the symmetric states with S=1 and M=1,0,-1.

The S=1, M=1 state is |↑↑↑⟩.

S=1, M=0 state: I think it's (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3), which is exactly our psi.

Wait, wait! So, that suggests that psi is the S=1, M=0 state. So, that's in the triplet subspace, which has S=1.

Therefore, psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S(S+1)ħ² = 1*(2)ħ²= 2 ħ². So, S_total^2 |psi⟩ = 2 ħ² |psi⟩.

Thus, H |psi⟩ = (A/2)(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) |psi⟩ = (A/2)( (8/4 - 9/4) ) ħ² |psi⟩ = (A/2)(-1/4) ħ² |psi⟩ = (-A/8) ħ² |psi⟩.

Wait, hold on, that conflicts with my earlier thought. So, wait, S_total^2 |psi⟩ = 2 ħ² |psi⟩.

Wait, so H |psi⟩ = (A/2)(2 ħ² - (9/4) ħ² ) |psi⟩ = (A/2)( (8/4 - 9/4) ) ħ² |psi⟩ = (A/2)(-1/4) ħ² |psi⟩ = (-A/8) ħ² |psi⟩.

So, the energy is -A/8 ħ²? But that's different from the given answer. Hmm.

Wait, but the user says that the correct answer is expectation value of E is 3/4 A ħ².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in associating psi with an eigenstate.

Wait, but according to my calculation, psi is the S=1, M=0 state, so it's an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 2 ħ², so the energy is -A/8 ħ². But the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ², so something is wrong here.

Wait, let me check whether psi is indeed the S=1, M=0 state.

The S=1, M=0 state is constructed as (1/sqrt(3))*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ), which is exactly psi.

So, yes, psi is the S=1, M=0 state, so it is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 2 ħ².

Thus, H psi = (A/2)*(2 ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) psi = (A/2)*(-1/4 ħ²) psi = (-A/8) ħ² psi.

So, the energy is -A/8 ħ².

But the given answer says that the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, that suggests I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps my calculation is correct, but the given answer is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me double-check H.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Expressed in terms of S_total^2, H = A*( [ (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2 ) / 2 ] ).

Sum S_i^2 = 3*(3/4 ħ²) = 9/4 ħ².

Thus, H = A*( (S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ² ) / 2 )

Thus, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9/8) A ħ².

Therefore, if S_total^2 |psi⟩ = 2 ħ² |psi⟩,

H |psi⟩ = (A/2)(2 ħ²) |psi⟩ - (9/8) A ħ² |psi⟩ = (A ħ²) |psi⟩ - (9/8) A ħ² |psi⟩ = (-1/8 A ħ²) |psi⟩.

Thus, H |psi⟩ = (-1/8 A ħ²) |psi⟩, so the energy is -1/8 A ħ².

But the given answer says it's not an eigenstate with expectation value 3/4 A ħ².

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that psi is an eigenstate.

Wait, let me think again: Is psi an eigenstate of S_total^2?

I thought that because psi is the S=1, M=0 state, so it's an eigenstate. But perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: let me compute S_total^2 psi.

Let me write S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, S_total^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²) |↑↑↓⟩ + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, that's 9/4 ħ² |↑↑↓⟩ + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly for the other terms.

So, let me compute S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩.

As I tried earlier, perhaps it's better to compute S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 acting on |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2).

So, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² ) - S_total_12^2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

But S_total_12 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S1 + S2)|↑↑↓⟩ = S1|↑↑↓⟩ + S2|↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1|↑↑↓⟩: acting on the first spin, it's (1/2 ħ)|↓⟩, so (1/2 ħ)|↓↑↓⟩.

Similarly, S2|↑↑↓⟩: acting on the second spin, (1/2 ħ)|↓↑↓⟩.

So, S_total_12 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)|↓↑↓⟩ + (1/2 ħ)|↑↓↓⟩.

Then, S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (S_total_12)^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute (S_total_12)^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = ( (S1 + S2) )^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Which is (S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ² + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

So, S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (3/2 ħ² + 2 S1·S2 ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Thus, from above, S1·S2 |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2)( 3/2 ħ² - (3/2 ħ² + 2 S1·S2 ) ) |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, that seems circular. Alternatively, perhaps compute S_total_12^2 |↑↑↓⟩.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 acting on psi.

Let me consider that H psi = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi.

So, to compute H psi, I need to compute each term S1·S2 psi, S1·S3 psi, S2·S3 psi, then add them up and multiply by A.

Compute S1·S2 psi.

We have:

S1·S2 = (S1_x S2_x + S1_y S2_y + S1_z S2_z )

We can compute each component.

First, S1_z S2_z psi: S1_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)|↑↑↓⟩, S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1/2 ħ)|↑↑↓⟩. So, S1_z S2_z psi = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) psi = (1/4 ħ²) psi.

Similarly, S1_z S2_z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) |↑↓↑⟩ = (1/4 ħ²) |↑↓↑⟩, and same for |↓↑↑⟩.

Thus, S1_z S2_z |↑↑↓⟩ + S1_z S2_z |↑↓↑⟩ + S1_z S2_z |↓↑↑⟩ = (1/4 ħ²)( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ) = (1/4 ħ²) psi.

Now, compute S1_x S2_x psi.

Note that S_x = (ħ/2)(|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|).

So, S1_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓↑↓⟩, and S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑↓↑⟩.

Thus, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↓⟩ |↑↓↑⟩ ? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1_x |↑↑↓⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↑↑↓⟩? No, actually, S1_x and S2_x act on different particles, so S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1_x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↑⟩ ⊗ |↓⟩.

So, S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S2_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩. So, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↓↓⟩.

Similarly, S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = S1_x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↓⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩.

S1_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩, S2_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩.

Thus, S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↓↑↑⟩.

Similarly, S1_x S2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = S1_x |↓⟩ ⊗ S2_x |↑⟩ ⊗ |↑⟩.

S1_x |↓⟩ = (ħ/2)|↑⟩, S2_x |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)|↓⟩.

Thus, S1_x S2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ/2)^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Thus, S1_x S2_x |↑↑↓⟩ + S1_x S2_x |↑↓↑⟩ + S1_x S2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = (ħ²/4)( |↓↓↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ).

But note that |↓↑↑⟩ and |↑↓↑⟩ are different states.

Thus, S1_x S2_x psi = (ħ²/4) ( |↓↓↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ ) = (ħ²/4) ( |↓↓↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ).

Similarly, compute S1_y S2_y psi.

S1_y |↑⟩ = (ħ/2)i
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles and a specific Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H and, if not, what the expectation value of the energy is. The supposed answer is that it's not an eigenstate and the expectation value is (3/4)*A*hbar². I need to figure out why that is the case.

First, let me recall what the dot product of spin operators means. S1·S2 is equal to (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - S1² - S2². So, if I apply this to each term in H, I can rewrite H as a function of the total spin operators squared.

Let me denote S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, rearranging, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Therefore, H can be rewritten as H = A*(S² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Since each Si² is for a spin-1/2 particle, S1² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Similarly for S2² and S3². So, H becomes H = A/2*(S² - 3*(3/4)ħ²).

Simplifying that, H = (A/2)*(S² - (9/4)ħ²) = (A/2)*S² - (9A/8)ħ².

So, H = (A/2) S² - (9A/8)ħ².

Now, since H is expressed in terms of S², the total spin squared, the eigenfunctions of H are the same as the eigenfunctions of S². So, if the state psi is an eigenstate of S², then it will be an eigenstate of H.

So, let's check whether psi is an eigenstate of S².

To compute S², we need to consider (S1 + S2 + S3)². Expanding this, we get S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). But we already did that earlier. However, perhaps we can think in terms of quantum numbers.

Each spin 1/2 particle has spin 1/2, so the possible total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2? Let me verify that.

Yes, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Because adding three spin 1/2's: first two can combine to 1 or 0, then combining with the third gives 2, 1, or 1, 0. But since we have three spin 1/2's, the allowed total spins are 3/2 (all aligned) or 1/2, depending on the combination.

But hold on, is that correct? Let me think about the addition.

If I have three spin-1/2 particles:

First, combine two into a spin 1/2 or 0.

If the first two combine to spin 1/2, then combining with the third spin 1/2 can give 3/2 or 1/2.

If the first two combine to spin 0, then combining with the third spin 1/2 can only give 1/2.

Therefore, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

So, the state psi must be either a 3/2 spin state or a 1/2 spin state.

Wait, let me analyze the state psi given.

It's 1/sqrt(3)*(up up down + up down up + down up up).

Each term is a product of two spins up and one spin down.

So, in terms of spin configurations, each term has exactly two spins up and one spin down.

Therefore, the total spin in each term is 1/2, because we have two spins up (each with spin 1/2) and one spin down.

Wait, no. Wait, the total spin is not just adding the individual spins.

Wait, no. The total spin is a combination of the three spins. If all three spins are up, then the total spin is 3/2. If two are up and one is down, then the total spin could be different.

Wait, no. The total spin is the sum of the individual spins. Since each spin is 1/2, the possible total spins are 3/2 or 1/2.

But in this state, each term has two spins up and one spin down.

So, for each term, the total spin is 2*(1/2) + (-1/2) = 1/2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because adding spins is not just adding the magnitudes, it's adding vectors.

So, for each term in psi, each term is a product state with two spins up and one spin down.

To find the total spin of each term, I need to compute S² acting on each term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the eigenvalue of S² for the state psi.

But perhaps we can find the total spin by counting the number of possible combinations.

Wait, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the state with two spins up and one spin down can be a combination of different total spin states.

Wait, perhaps it's a singlet (total spin 0) or triplet (total spin 1). But wait, for three particles, the total spin can be different.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of generators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S² in the state psi.

If I can compute the expectation value of S², then since H is expressed in terms of S², I can find the expectation value of H.

So, let me try that approach.

First, let's compute <psi|S²|psi>.

But S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, <psi|S²|psi> = <psi|S1²|psi> + <psi|S2²|psi> + <psi|S3²|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S2|psi> + 2<psi|S1·S3|psi> + 2<psi|S2·S3|psi>.

Since S1, S2, S3 are spin operators, their expectation values in the state psi can be computed.

But since each term in psi is a product state, perhaps it's easier to compute each expectation value.

Wait, but S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ².

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

So, maybe we can compute each term.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each of these expectation values.

Let me note that each term in psi is symmetric with respect to permutation of the spins. So, perhaps the expectation values for S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 are all equal. Therefore, I can compute one of them and multiply by 3.

Similarly, the expectation value of S1², S2², S3² are each (3/4)ħ², since each spin is spin 1/2.

So, let me compute <psi|S1²|psi> = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ². Wait, no, each S_i² is (3/4)ħ², and since there are three of them, it's 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Similarly, the sum of <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> = 3*<S1·S2>.

So, let me compute <S1·S2>.

Since S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ², then:

<S1·S2> = (1/2)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4)ħ².

Now, what is <(S1 + S2)^2>?

Expanding (S1 + S2)^2 = S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1²> + <S2²> + 2 <S1·S2>.

But we already know <S1²> = <S2²> = (3/4)ħ².

So, substituting, we have:

<S1 + S2>² = (3/4)ħ² + (3/4)ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> = (3/2)ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>.

Substituting back into <S1·S2>:

<S1·S2> = (1/2)*[(3/2)ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>] - (3/4)ħ².

Simplify:

<S1·S2> = (3/4)ħ² + <S1·S2> - (3/4)ħ².

Wait, that's:

(1/2)*(3/2 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>) - 3/4 ħ²

= (3/4)ħ² + (1/2)*2 <S1·S2> - (3/4)ħ²

= (3/4)ħ² + <S1·S2> - (3/4)ħ²

= <S1·S2>

So, that leads us to <S1·S2> = <S1·S2>. Hmm, that's a tautology. So, that approach doesn't help.

Alternative approach: Let's compute <S1·S2> directly.

Since S1·S2 = (1/2)(σ1 · σ2)ħ², where σi are the Pauli matrices.

So, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of σ1 · σ2 in the state psi.

But ψ is a symmetric state under permutation of particles, but each term is two spins up and one spin down.

Wait, let me write out the state ψ in terms of computational basis.

Each term is a product state with two up and one down.

So, the basis states are |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up>. Each term is one of these, so ψ is symmetric under permutation.

To compute <σ1 · σ2>, we can note that σ1 · σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

So, if I can compute the expectation value of each of these components in the state ψ, then sum them up, I can get <σ1 · σ2>, and then multiply by (1/2)ħ² to get <S1·S2>.

So, let me compute each term separately.

First, let me note that each term in ψ is a product of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Let me define the three terms in ψ as:

ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, the state ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles.

Now, let's compute <σ1_x σ2_x>:

σ1_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, σ1_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Similarly for σ2_x.

So, to compute <σ1_x σ2_x>, we have:

⟨ψ | σ1_x σ2_x | ψ⟩.

Since σ1_x σ2_x is an operator that exchanges the spins of particles 1 and 2 if they are up or down.

So, let's compute each term.

Compute σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩:

σ1_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩

σ2_x |↓↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↓⟩

Wait, no. Wait, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = σ1_x (σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ )

= σ1_x |↑↓↓⟩ (since σ2_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩)

Then, σ1_x |↑↓↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩.

Wait, maybe it's better to write down each step.

Wait, let's compute σ1_x σ2_x acting on |↑↑↓⟩:

First, σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↓↑↓⟩.

Then, σ1_x |↓↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↓⟩.

So, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↓↑⟩:

σ2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↓↓↑⟩.

σ1_x |↓↓↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

So, σ1_x σ2_x |↑↓↑⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩.

Similarly, σ1_x σ2_x |↓↑↑⟩:

σ2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↑↑↑⟩.

σ1_x |↑↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, σ1_x σ2_x |↓↑↑⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, applying σ1_x σ2_x to ψ, we get:

(1/√3)[σ1_x σ2_x |↑↑↓⟩ + σ1_x σ2_x |↑↓↑⟩ + σ1_x σ2_x |↓↑↑⟩]

= (1/√3)[ |↑↓↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Now, to compute ⟨ψ | σ1_x σ2_x | ψ⟩, which is the inner product of ψ with σ1_x σ2_x ψ.

So, ψ is (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

So, the inner product becomes:

(1/√3)(1/√3) [ ⟨↑↑↓ | + ⟨↑↓↑ | + ⟨↓↑↑ | ] [ |↑↓↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Compute each term:

⟨↑↑↓ |↑↓↓⟩ = 0, since the first two spins differ.

⟨↑↑↓ |↑↓↑⟩ = 0, since the third spin is down vs. up.

⟨↑↑↓ |↓↑↑⟩ = 0, same reason.

Now, ⟨↑↓↑ |↑↓↓⟩ = 0.

⟨↑↓↑ |↑↓↑⟩ = 1.

⟨↑↓↑ |↓↑↑⟩ = 0, since the first spin differs.

⟨↓↑↑ |↑↓↓⟩ = 0.

⟨↓↑↑ |↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

⟨↓↑↑ |↓↑↑⟩ = 1.

So, the only non-zero contributions are from the second and third terms in ψ† and the second and third terms in ψ.

Thus, the inner product is (1/3)*(1 + 1) = 2/3.

Therefore, <σ1_x σ2_x> = 2/3.

Similarly, I need to compute <σ1_y σ2_y> and <σ1_z σ2_z>.

Starting with σ1_z σ2_z.

σ1_z σ2_z |↑↑↓⟩ = (1)(1)|↑↑↓⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_z σ2_z |↑↓↑⟩ = (1)(-1)|↑↓↑⟩ = -|↑↓↑⟩.

σ1_z σ2_z |↓↑↑⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓↑↑⟩ = -|↓↑↑⟩.

Thus, σ1_z σ2_z ψ = (1/√3)[ |↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Then, ⟨ψ | σ1_z σ2_z | ψ⟩ = (1/3)[⟨↑↑↓| - ⟨↑↓↑| - ⟨↓↑↑|][ |↑↑↓⟩ - |↑↓↑⟩ - |↓↑↑⟩ ].

Compute the inner product:

⟨↑↑↓|↑↑↓⟩ = 1.

⟨↑↑↓|↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

⟨↑↑↓|↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨↑↓↑|↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

⟨↑↓↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 1.

⟨↑↓↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 0.

⟨↓↑↑|↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

⟨↓↑↑|↑↓↑⟩ = 0.

⟨↓↑↑|↓↑↑⟩ = 1.

So, the inner product is (1/3)(1 - 1 - 1) = (1/3)(-1) = -1/3.

Thus, <σ1_z σ2_z> = -1/3.

Now, moving on to σ1_y σ2_y.

Hmm, σ_y is a bit trickier because it involves imaginary components.

σ1_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and similarly for σ2_y.

So, σ1_y σ2_y is a product of these matrices.

But perhaps instead of working with matrices, I can compute it using spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ1_y σ2_y can be computed using the state.

But maybe it's better to use the identity that for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states have specific expectation values for σ1·σ2.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, and the triplet states are:

|↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, and |↓↓⟩.

The expectation value of σ1·σ2 for the singlet state is (-3/4)ħ², and for the triplet states, it's (1/4)ħ².

Wait, let me recall that:

σ1·σ2 = 2 S1·S2 = (1/2)(σ1 + σ2)^2 - (3/4)I.

Wait, earlier relation, right.

Alternatively, in terms of the total spin S:

σ1·σ2 = 2 S1·S2 = 2 ( (S_total)^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) / 2 = (S_total)^2 - 3/4 I.

So, in the singlet state, which has S_total = 0, σ1·σ2 = 0 - 3/4 I = -3/4 I.

In the triplet states (S_total = 1), σ1·σ2 = (1)(1 + 1) - 3/4 I = (2 - 3/4)I = (5/4)I? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2.

Therefore, S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2.

So, in terms of σ1·σ2, since S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)I.

But S1 + S2 in terms of Pauli matrices is (σ1 + σ2)/2, so (S1 + S2)^2 = (σ1 + σ2)^2 /4.

Thus, S1·S2 = ( (σ1 + σ2)^2 /4 - 3/4 I ) / 1.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the singlet state is:

⟨singlet|σ1·σ2|singlet⟩ = (-3/4)ħ².

In the triplet states, the expectation value is (1/4)ħ².

Wait, let me check:

σ1·σ2 for spin 1/2 particles:

σ1·σ2 = σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z.

For the singlet state, which is |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩, normalized:

⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = (⟨↑↓| - ⟨↓↑|)(σ1_x σ2_x + σ1_y σ2_y + σ1_z σ2_z)(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩).

Compute each term.

First, compute each component:

σ1_x σ2_x |↑↓⟩ = |↓↑⟩, σ1_x σ2_x |↓↑⟩ = |↑↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_z σ2_z |↑↓⟩ = (1)(-1)|↑↓⟩ = -|↑↓⟩, σ1_z σ2_z |↓↑⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓↑⟩ = -|↓↑⟩.

For σ1_y σ2_y, note that σ1_y |↑⟩ = i|↓⟩, σ1_y |↓⟩ = -i|↑⟩.

Thus, σ1_y |↑↓⟩ = i|↓↓⟩, σ1_y |↓↑⟩ = -i|↑↑⟩.

Therefore, σ1_y σ2_y |↑↓⟩ = (i)(-i)|↓↓⟩ = ( -i^2 )|↓↓⟩ = (1)|↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ1_y σ2_y |↓↑⟩ = (-i)(i)|↑↑⟩ = (-i^2)|↑↑⟩ = (1)|↑↑⟩.

So, now, compute each component:

⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = ⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ + ⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ - ⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ - ⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ + ⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩.

That's a lot of terms, but let's compute each:

1. ⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓|↓↑⟩ = 0

2. ⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓|↓↓⟩ = 0

3. ⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ = ⟨↑↓| - |↑↓⟩ = -1

4. - ⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ = - ⟨↓↑|↓↑⟩ = -1

5. - ⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ = - ⟨↓↑|↓↓⟩ = 0

6. - ⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ = - ⟨↓↑| - |↑↓⟩ = 1

7. - ⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ = - ⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩ = -1

8. - ⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ = - ⟨↑↓|↑↑⟩ = 0

9. - ⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩ = - ⟨↑↓| - |↓↑⟩ = 1

10. ⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ = ⟨↓↑|↑↓⟩ = 0

11. ⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ = ⟨↓↑|↑↑⟩ = 0

12. ⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩ = ⟨↓↑| - |↓↑⟩ = -1

Now, summing all these terms:

1. 0

2. 0

3. -1

4. -1

5. 0

6. 1

7. -1

8. 0

9. 1

10. 0

11. 0

12. -1

Adding them up: (-1) + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = (-2) + 0 + 0 + (-1) = -3.

But the state was normalized as 1/√2, so we need to divide by (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So, ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = (-3)/ (1/2) = -6? Wait, that can't be right because σ1·σ2 has units of ħ², and for spin 1/2, the maximum value should be 3/4 ħ².

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no, the state |↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ is already normalized as 1/√2.

Wait, but when I computed the above, I didn't account for normalization.

Wait, actually, in the computation, each term is summed over, but the state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, so in computing the expectation value, the total sum is (sum of inner products) divided by (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

But in the computation above, the total sum was -3, so ⟨σ1·σ2⟩ = (-3)/(1/2) = -6, which is way too big. That must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute:

We have:

⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ = 0

⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ = 0

⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ = -1

Similarly,

-⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↑↓⟩ = -1

-⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↑↓⟩ = 0

-⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↑↓⟩ = 1

-⟨↑↓|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ = -1

-⟨↑↓|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ = 0

-⟨↑↓|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩ = 1

⟨↓↑|σ1_x σ2_x|↓↑⟩ = 0

⟨↓↑|σ1_y σ2_y|↓↑⟩ = 0

⟨↓↑|σ1_z σ2_z|↓↑⟩ = -1

So, adding all these terms:

0 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + (-1) =

Let's add step by step:

Start with 0.

Add 0: 0.

Add (-1): -1.

Add (-1): -2.

Add 0: -2.

Add 1: -1.

Add (-1): -2.

Add 0: -2.

Add 1: -1.

Add 0: -1.

Add 0: -1.

Add (-1): -2.

Wait, that's different. So, the total sum is -2.

But since the state is normalized by 1/√2, the expectation value is (-2)/(1/2) = -4.

That still seems too large because the maximum value for σ1·σ2 is (3/4)ħ².

I think perhaps this approach is getting too messy. Maybe I should use a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ1·σ2 in the singlet state is -3/4 and in the triplet state is +1/4.

Wait, but in our case, the state is two spins up and one spin down, which for three particles. So, it's not a singlet or triplet of two particles, but a state of three particles with two up and one down.

Therefore, perhaps it's a different kind of state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, so it's a symmetric state.

Given that, perhaps the total spin is 1/2, but let me check.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the expectation value of S².

Since ψ is a state with two spins up and one spin down, each term is a product state with two up and one down.

So, to compute <ψ|S²|ψ>, which is the sum over i,j <ψ|S_i^2|ψ> + 2<ψ|S_i · S_j|ψ> for i < j.

Wait, but S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, so S² = sum Si² + 2 sum_{i<j} S_i · S_j.

So, <S²> = <ψ| sum Si² + 2 sum S_i · S_j |ψ> = sum <Si²> + 2 sum <S_i · S_j>.

We know that each <Si²> = (3/4)ħ², so sum <Si²> = 3*(3/4)ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Now, let's compute <S_i · S_j> for each pair (i,j).

Assuming symmetry, all <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, <S2·S3> are equal, so let me compute one and multiply by 3.

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<S1 + S2>² - <S1²> - <S2²>).

But S1 + S2 is an operator whose expectation value is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that S1 + S2 = S_{12}, and the expectation value of S_{12}² in the state.

But to compute that, it's similar to what I was trying earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can write S1 + S2 = √(S1² + S2² + 2 S1·S2).

But maybe I'm going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the state as a combination of different spin states.

Wait, since each term in ψ has two spins up and one spin down, the state is a member of the 3/2 or 1/2 total spin multiplet.

But if the state is symmetric, it's likely part of the higher spin multiplet.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states transform under the 3/2 representation, while the antisymmetric states transform under 1/2.

Since ψ is symmetric, it's in the 3/2 multiplet, which has S = 3/2 and m_s = 1/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Wait, but ψ has two up and one down, so m_s = 1/2.

So, ψ is a state with S=3/2 and m_s=1/2.

Therefore, S² ψ = ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ² ψ = (15/4)ħ² ψ.

Hence, ψ is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue (15/4)ħ².

Wait, so H = (A/2) S² - (9A/8) ħ².

Therefore, if ψ is an eigenstate of S², then it's an eigenstate of H.

So, the energy would be (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) - (9A/8) ħ² = (15A/8) ħ² - (9A/8) ħ² = (6A/8) ħ² = (3A/4) ħ².

Wait, but the supposed answer is 3/4 A ħ², so that matches.

But wait, that would mean ψ is an eigenstate of H, but the initial assertion was that it's not. So, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that ψ is in the 3/2 multiplet is wrong.

Wait, let's think again.

Each term in ψ is two spins up and one spin down. Let's see what is the total spin of each term.

For a single term like |↑↑↓⟩, the total spin S is 1/2, because you have two spins up (each contributing 1/2) and one spin down (-1/2), but that's not how spin addition works.

Actually, when combining three spins, the total spin is not just the sum of the individual spins' magnitudes.

Wait, no. The total spin is the sum of the spin vectors, so each spin is a vector, and the total spin depends on their relative orientations.

So, the state |↑↑↓⟩ is not a singlet or triplet, but a state of three spins. Similarly for the other terms.

But, the state ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, so it's an eigenstate of the total spin squared.

Earlier, I thought that ψ has S = 3/2, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps ψ is in the 1/2 representation.

Wait, to check whether ψ is an eigenstate of S², let's compute S²|ψ>.

If ψ is in the 3/2 multiplet, then S²|ψ> = (15/4)ħ² |ψ>.

But to confirm, perhaps I can compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |ψ>.

Given that ψ is symmetric, perhaps it's easier to use ladder operators or some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write ψ in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, another idea: since ψ has two spins up and one spin down, it's similar to the state |++−⟩, which is part of the 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, but the 3/2 multiplet has four states: 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

But ψ is only part of the 1/2 multiplet or 3/2.

Wait, maybe it's in the 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states form the 3/2 multiplet, which has dimension 2*(3/2) + 1 = 4 states.

The state ψ is a symmetric state with two spins up and one spin down. So, it's a linear combination of these states.

But how does it decompose in terms of the spin states?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the action of S² on ψ.

Let me recall that S² = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

So, S² |ψ> = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^
[overthinking]
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(|↑1↑2↓3⟩ + |↑1↓2↑3⟩ + |↓1↑2↑3⟩). 

First, I need to recall that spin operators S1, S2, S3 are each 3x3 matrices for spin-1/2 particles. The dot product S_i·S_j is equal to (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But maybe there's a better way to handle this without getting bogged down in matrix multiplication.

I remember that for two spins, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z. And more generally, for multiple spins, the dot product of each pair can be expanded similarly. However, calculating S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 might be a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a more manageable form.

Wait, another thought: I recall that the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared operator. Specifically, the identity is:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)

Where S_total is the total spin operator S = S1 + S2 + S3. That seems useful because if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H would act on it in a simple way.

So, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for psi, then I can find the eigenvalue of H.

Let me compute S_total^2. S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). Therefore, rearranged, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. So H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Now, for each spin 1/2 particle, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Since H is a scalar multiple of S_total^2 minus three times (3/4)ħ^2, let's factor that out.

So, H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2.

Wait, hold on, no:

Wait, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, so H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2. But maybe I don't need to compute the constants yet.

Alternatively, I can write H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(S_i^2))/2. Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ^2, H becomes:

H = A*((S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2))/2.

But perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of H in the state psi. Since H can be expressed as A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2, then the expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - 3*(3/4)ħ^2)/2.

So, if I can find ⟨S_total^2⟩ for the state psi, I can compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the total spin S of the state psi. If the state is a singlet or a triplet, that will determine S_total^2's eigenvalue.

Looking at the state psi: it's a symmetric combination of states with two spins up and one spin down. Let me write it out explicitly.

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, the state is symmetric under permutation of the spins. Therefore, it should be a singlet or a triplet? Wait, the total spin S can be S=1 or S=0.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2. Wait, no, wait: when combining three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, no. Let me recall: for two spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=1 (triplet) and S=0 (singlet). For three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=3/2 or S=1/2. Because when combining three spin-1/2, you can have either all three aligned (S=3/2) or two aligned and one opposite, but that might not necessarily give the same total spin. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of coupling two particles first.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So, the state has S_z = (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ.

So S_z is 1/2 ħ.

Wait, is that correct? Let me compute the total z-component of spin for the state psi.

Each term in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So for each term, the z-component is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ħ = (1/2)ħ.

Therefore, the total S_z for the state psi is (1/2)ħ.

Hmm, so S_z = 1/2 ħ.

But what is the total spin S? Since the state has S_z = 1/2 ħ, which is less than the maximum possible for S=3/2 (which would be 3/2 ħ), and for S=1/2, the maximum S_z is 1/2 ħ.

Wait, so the state psi has S_z = 1/2 ħ, which is the same as an S=1/2 spin state.

But could it be a combination of higher spins? Or is it necessarily in an S=1/2 subspace?

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the state is symmetric under permutation of the three spins. So, what are the possible symmetries for three spin-1/2 particles?

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. Let me consider the state as a symmetric combination of two up and one down spins.

In such a case, the state is symmetric under permutation, so it should be a singlet or a triplet?

Wait, in two spin-1/2 particles, a symmetric combination is the triplet (S=1), and an antisymmetric combination is the singlet (S=0). For three spin-1/2 particles, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the state as a combination of symmetric states.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the action of S_total^2 on psi and see if it's an eigenstate. If it is, then I can find the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Another approach: The Hamiltonian H can be written as H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, the expectation value of H is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩).

Therefore, if I compute each of these expectation values, I can sum them and multiply by A to get ⟨H⟩.

So, let me compute ⟨S1·S2⟩, ⟨S1·S3⟩, and ⟨S2·S3⟩ for the state psi.

Since S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Alternatively, S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i^+ S_j^+ + S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+ + S_i^- S_j^-) - (1/4) δ_{ij} I, but wait, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps for spin-1/2 particles, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. So, maybe it's better to compute ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ and the terms involving the ladder operators.

Wait, maybe it's better to express S_i·S_j in terms of the total spin operators.

Wait, another thought: for two spin-1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/4)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

But perhaps we can compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ for the state psi by considering the expectation values of S1^z S2^z, S1^+ S2^-, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S1·S2 in psi.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, let me note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩ + ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩) + ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩.

Similarly for the other terms.

Now, let's compute each of these expectation values.

First, let me compute ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩. For each term in psi, I can compute this.

For each term in psi, which are |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩, the S1^z S2^z expectation is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 for particles 1 and 2, etc.

Wait, let me see.

In the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

So, ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ for this term is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, in |↑↓↑⟩, S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, S3^z = +1/2. So ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ here is (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4.

Wait, but wait, no. The expectation value for S1^z S2^z is (1/2)(1/2) if both are up, (1/2)(-1/2) if one is up and the other down, and (-1/2)(-1/2) if both are down.

But in our state psi, each term has two up and one down. So in each term, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), there are specific possibilities.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ for the entire state.

So, for each basis state in psi, compute S1^z S2^z, S1^z S3^z, etc., and then average.

But maybe that's getting too involved. Alternatively, note that for the entire state psi, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is the same for each term, except that when you sum over all three terms, some terms might cancel out.

Wait, actually, let me consider that each term in psi is (1/sqrt(3)) times a basis state with two ups and one down. Therefore, for ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩, we can compute for each basis state and then average.

But in each of these basis states, for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), we can compute S_i^z S_j^z.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to note that for the entire state psi, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is (1/3) times [ (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(-1/2) + (-1/2)(-1/2) ].

Wait, no. Let me think.

Each of the three basis states in psi has two spins up and one spin down. So for each basis state, the spin configuration is such that two are up and one is down. Therefore, in each basis state, for each pair (i,j), the product S_i^z S_j^z is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 if both are up, (1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4 if one is up and the other is down, and (-1/2)(-1/2) = 1/4 if both are down.

But in each basis state, exactly one of the pairs is both up, one is both down, and one is one up and one down.

Wait, let's see. For the basis state |↑↑↓⟩: pairs (1,2) are both up, (1,3) is up and down, (2,3) is up and down.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩: (1,2) is up and down, (1,3) is both up, (2,3) is down and up.

And for |↓↑↑⟩: (1,2) is down and up, (1,3) is up and up, (2,3) is up and up.

Wait, no. Wait, in |↑↑↓⟩, pairs:

(1,2): ↑↑ → S1^z S2^z = (1/2)(1/2)=1/4

(1,3): ↑↓ → (1/2)(-1/2)= -1/4

(2,3): ↑↓ → same as above, -1/4

Similarly, |↑↓↑⟩:

(1,2): ↑↓ → -1/4

(1,3): ↑↑ → 1/4

(2,3): ↓↑ → -1/4

And |↓↑↑⟩:

(1,2): ↓↑ → -1/4

(1,3): ↓↑ → -1/4

(2,3): ↑↑ → 1/4

So, in each basis state, each pair contributes either 1/4, -1/4, or -1/4.

Now, when we average over all three basis states with equal weight (1/3 each), what's the average of S1^z S2^z?

Looking at the contributions:

For S1^z S2^z:

From |↑↑↓⟩: 1/4

From |↑↓↑⟩: -1/4

From |↓↑↑⟩: -1/4

So, average is (1/4 -1/4 -1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Similarly, for S1^z S3^z:

From |↑↑↓⟩: -1/4

From |↑↓↑⟩: 1/4

From |↓↑↑⟩: -1/4

So, average is (-1/4 +1/4 -1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Same for S2^z S3^z:

From |↑↑↓⟩: -1/4

From |↑↓↑⟩: -1/4

From |↓↑↑⟩: 1/4

Average: (-1/4 -1/4 +1/4)/3 = (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Wait, but that seems odd because S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is symmetric, so perhaps all three expectation values are the same.

But wait, let me check.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each term is different.

Wait, for each basis state, each pair is either 1/4 or -1/4. So across the three basis states, each pair appears in each state once as 1/4 and twice as -1/4? Wait, no.

Wait, looking at S1^z S2^z across the three basis states:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: 1/4

2. |↑↓↑⟩: -1/4

3. |↓↑↑⟩: -1/4

So, sum over all three is 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Average is (-1/4)/3 = -1/12.

Similarly, S1^z S3^z:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: -1/4

2. |↑↓↑⟩: 1/4

3. |↓↑↑⟩: -1/4

Sum: -1/4 +1/4 -1/4 = -1/4.

Average: -1/12.

Same with S2^z S3^z:

1. |↑↑↓⟩: -1/4

2. |↑↓↑⟩: -1/4

3. |↓↑↑⟩: 1/4

Sum: -1/4 -1/4 +1/4 = -1/4.

Average: -1/12.

So, each ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ is -1/12.

Now, moving on to the ladder operator terms: ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ and ⟨S_i^- S_j^+⟩.

Since S_i^+ |↓⟩ = |↑⟩ * (1/2)ħ, and similarly for the inverse.

But wait, I need to compute ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ and ⟨S_i^- S_j^+⟩.

Wait, perhaps I can compute these by considering the matrix elements between the basis states.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that S_i^+ S_j^- is the raising operator for i and lowering for j, which can change the spin state.

But since our state psi is symmetric, maybe certain matrix elements vanish.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ is the average number of transitions from j's down state to i's up state.

Wait, perhaps for each pair (i,j), the expectation value ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ can be computed by considering how often |↑⟩ in i comes after |↓⟩ in j in the state.

But given that the state psi is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, perhaps only certain transitions are non-zero.

But this might get complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Wait, another idea: since the state is symmetric under exchange of the spins, perhaps the expectation value of S_i^+ S_j^- is zero for any i ≠ j. Because S_i^+ S_j^- is not symmetric, but when i and j are exchanged, it becomes S_j^+ S_i^-, which is the conjugate. But in a symmetric state, the expectation value of S_i^+ S_j^- should equal its conjugate, which is the same as ⟨S_j^+ S_i^-⟩. Therefore, 2⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ = ⟨S_i^+ S_j^- + S_j^+ S_i^-⟩, but maybe that doesn't help directly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps for i ≠ j, the state is symmetric, so the ladder operators might have zero expectation value. Because S_i^+ S_j^- would change the spin of i and j, and since the state is symmetric, perhaps such transitions average out to zero.

Wait, for example, consider ⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩ in psi.

In the state |↑↑↓⟩, S1^+ S2^- would act as follows: S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0, because spin-up can't be raised further, and S2^- |↑⟩ = 0. So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↑↓⟩ = 0.

In |↑↓↑⟩, S1^+ S2^- would act on S2^- |↓⟩ = (1/2) |↑⟩. So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑⟩ = S1^+ (1/2) |↑⟩ = (1/2)(0) = 0, because S1 is up.

In |↓↑↑⟩, S1^+ S2^- would act on S2^- |↑⟩ = (1/2) |↓⟩. So, S1^+ S2^- |↓↑↑⟩ = S1^+ |↓⟩ * (1/2) = (1/2) |↑⟩ * (1/2) = (1/4) |↑↑⟩.

But wait, this is getting too involved. Perhaps it's better to note that for i ≠ j, the expectation value ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ is zero for the symmetric state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that since the state is symmetric, the matrix elements of S_i^+ S_j^- will vanish when i ≠ j. Because the state is symmetric, so the exchange of i and j would leave the state invariant, but S_i^+ S_j^- is not symmetric, so its expectation value would be zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the state is symmetric under exchange of i and j, then the expectation value of a non-symmetric operator like S_i^+ S_j^- would be zero.

So, for i ≠ j, ⟨S_i^+ S_j^-⟩ = 0.

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ for i ≠ j is equal to ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩, because the ladder operator terms vanish.

Thus, for each pair (i,j), i ≠ j, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ = -1/12.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ = -1/12 for each pair.

Wait, but that seems odd because if all three pairs have the same expectation value, which is negative, that would affect the total sum.

But let me confirm again.

Yes, from earlier, for each pair (i,j), the average of S_i^z S_j^z is -1/12.

Therefore, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ + (1/2)⟨S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+⟩. But we just determined that the ladder operator terms vanish, so ⟨S1·S2⟩ = -1/12.

Similarly for ⟨S1·S3⟩ = -1/12 and ⟨S2·S3⟩ = -1/12.

Therefore, the total expectation value of H is:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩) = A*(-1/12 -1/12 -1/12) = A*(-1/4) = (-A/4).

Wait, but that contradicts the given answer, which is expectation value 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I missed a factor of ħ² somewhere, because the spin operators S_i have units of ħ.

Wait, right! I forgot that S_i has units of ħ. So, when I compute ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩, each S_i^z is 1/2 ħ or -1/2 ħ. So, each S_i^z S_j^z has units of ħ².

Therefore, I need to correct my previous calculation by including ħ².

So, revisiting ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩.

In each basis state, say |↑↑↓⟩, S1^z S2^z = (1/2 ħ)(1/2 ħ) = (1/4) ħ².

Similarly, for |↑↓↑⟩ and |↓↑↑⟩, in each pair, the product is either (1/4) ħ² or (-1/4) ħ².

Thus, the average ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ for each pair (i,j) is (-1/12) ħ², as before, but now multiplied by ħ².

Wait, no. Wait, when I calculated the average, I had 1/4 and -1/4, but each of those has units of (1/2)^2 (ħ^2). So, when I compute the average, which was (-1/4)/3, that gives (-1/12) ħ².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify:

Each term in the basis state, such as |↑↑↓⟩, contributes (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 in units of (ħ^2). So, each term is (1/4) ħ².

Similarly, when I average over the three basis states, I have:

For ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩, the sum is (1/4 -1/4 -1/4) ħ² = (-1/4) ħ².

Average is (-1/4) /3 ħ² = (-1/12) ħ².

Therefore, each ⟨S_i^z S_j^z⟩ = (-1/12) ħ².

Thus, the expectation value of S_i·S_j for i≠j is (-1/12) ħ².

Now, since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), the expectation value is:

⟨H⟩ = A*( (-1/12) ħ² + (-1/12) ħ² + (-1/12) ħ² ) = A*(-1/4) ħ².

But the given answer is 3/4 A ħ². So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula for S_total^2.

Earlier, I had H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

But perhaps I should re-express H correctly.

Wait, the identity is S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Each S_i^2 = (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2 = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4) ħ²)/2.

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - (9/4) ħ²)/2.

Thus, if I can compute ⟨S_total^2⟩, I can find ⟨H⟩.

Now, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2⟩ + ⟨S2^2⟩ + ⟨S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

We have ⟨S1^2⟩ = ⟨S2^2⟩ = ⟨S3^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ².

We also have ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = (-1/12) ħ² each.

So, sum of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is 3*(-1/12) ħ² = (-1/4) ħ².

Thus, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3*(3/4) ħ² + 2*(-1/4) ħ² = (9/4) ħ² - (1/2) ħ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² = (7/4) ħ².

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*( (7/4) ħ² - (9/4) ħ² ) /2 = A*( (-2/4) ħ² ) /2 = A*(-1/4) ħ² /2 = A*(-1/8) ħ².

Wait, that can't be right because the given answer is 3/4 A ħ².

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in calculating ⟨S_total^2⟩.

Wait, let me re-do the calculation:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = ⟨S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2⟩ + 2⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩.

We have ⟨S1^2⟩ = ⟨S2^2⟩ = ⟨S3^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ². So sum is 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

⟨S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3⟩ = (-1/12) ħ² each, so sum is 3*(-1/12) ħ² = (-1/4) ħ².

Thus, 2*(sum) = 2*(-1/4) ħ² = (-1/2) ħ².

Therefore, ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 9/4 ħ² - 1/2 ħ² = (9/4 - 2/4) ħ² = 7/4 ħ².

Thus, ⟨H⟩ = A*(7/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-2/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-1/4 ħ²)/2 = -A*(1/8) ħ².

Wait, that can't be right because the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ².

I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identity.

Wait, let me double-check the identity:

S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Thus, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ - ⟨S3^2⟩)/2.

Which is A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2.

Given that ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 7/4 ħ².

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(7/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-2/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-1/4 ħ²)/2 = -A*(1/8) ħ².

Wait, that's negative. But the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ². So I must have made a mistake in either the calculation of ⟨S_total^2⟩ or in the earlier steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, so my calculation of ⟨S_total^2⟩ is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the state psi is a singlet or triplet state.

Wait, let me consider that the state psi has S_total = 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, in the state psi, each term has two spins up and one spin down. So, the total S_z is 1/2 ħ.

If the state is a singlet (S=0), then S_z must be zero, which it's not. Therefore, it can't be a singlet.

If it's a triplet (S=1), then S_z can be -1, 0, +1 ħ. Here, S_z is 1/2 ħ, which isn't one of those. Hmm, that suggests it's not a triplet state, but that can't be because triplet states have S=1 with S_z = -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps my assumption that S_total can only be 3/2 or 1/2 is incorrect. Actually, for three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin can be S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, that's correct. Because when you combine three spin-1/2's, you can have either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

So, perhaps the state psi is part of the S=1/2 multiplet.

In that case, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 would be S(S+1) ħ² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

Therefore, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 3/4 ħ², then:

⟨S_total^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ².

Thus, plugging back into ⟨H⟩:

⟨H⟩ = A*( (3/4) ħ² - 9/4 ħ² ) /2 = A*(-6/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-3/2 ħ²)/2 = A*(-3/4) ħ².

But that's negative, which contradicts the given answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the identity wrong.

Wait, no, the identity is correct: S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, rearranged: S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Thus, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S_total^2⟩ - 3*(3/4) ħ²)/2.

If ⟨S_total^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ² (for S=1/2), then:

⟨H⟩ = A*(3/4 ħ² - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-6/4 ħ²)/2 = A*(-3/2 ħ²)/2 = A*(-3/4) ħ².

But the given answer is positive 3/4 A ħ², so perhaps the state is an eigenstate with S_total^2 = 3/4 ħ² + something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is provided as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). The question is whether this state is an eigenfunction of H, and if it is, what its energy is. If not, I need to find the expectation value of E.

First, I need to understand what the state psi looks like. It's a symmetric state where two spins are up and one is down. Each term in the sum has one down spin in a different position. So, up1*up2*down3, up1*down2*up3, and down1*up2*up3. Each term is a product of three spins, two up and one down. The state is normalized by 1/sqrt(3).

Now, the Hamiltonian involves the dot product of spin operators. Remember that S_i are spin operators for each particle. The dot product S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) - (1/4){S_i^+, S_i^-, S_j^+, S_j^-} }, but I think the first form is better for expectation values.

But for spin 1/2 particles, there's a shortcut because S_i·S_j = (1/4)(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)/4. Since S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2.

So S_i·S_j = (1/4)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/4)ħ² - (3/4)ħ²] = (1/4)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (3/2)ħ²]

Thus, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*(1/4)[(S1 + S2)^2 + (S1 + S3)^2 + (S2 + S3)^2 - (9/2)ħ²]

But wait, let me verify that calculation. Let me compute S_i·S_j:

Yes, S_i·S_j = (1/4)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - (S_i^2 + S_j^2)]

So for each term, S1·S2 = (1/4)[(S1+S2)^2 - (3/4 ħ² + 3/4 ħ²)]

So S1·S2 = (1/4)[(S1+S2)^2 - (3/2)ħ²]

Hence, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (1/4)[(S1+S2)^2 + (S1+S3)^2 + (S2+S3)^2 - (9/2)ħ² *3]

Wait, no, hold on. Each of the three terms has S_i·S_j, so each term contributes -3/2 ħ². Wait, no—each term is S_i·S_j = (1/4)[(S_i + S_j)^2 - 3/2 ħ²]. Therefore, each of the three terms S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 contributes a -3/2 ħ² term. So altogether, the sum is (1/4)[(S1+S2)^2 + (S1+S3)^2 + (S2+S3)^2 - 3*(3/2 ħ²)].

Which is (1/4)[sum (S_i + S_j)^2 - (9/2) ħ²].

So H = A*(1/4)[sum (S_i + S_j)^2 - (9/2) ħ²]

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of H in the state psi, rather than dealing with the Hamiltonian in terms of (S_i + S_j)^2. Hmm.

So maybe I can compute <psi| H |psi>, that is, the expectation value, which if the state isn't an eigenstate, will give me the expectation energy.

But to compute the expectation value, I need to compute <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>, multiply by A, and add any constants.

So first, let's recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z.

Thus, the expectation value <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> can be written as the sum of the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

So let me compute each of these expectation values.

First, let's note that the state psi is symmetric in the sense that each term has two up spins and one down spin, but in different positions. So the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles, except for the down spin moving around.

Wait, is it? Let me see: psi = (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). So yes, it's symmetric because each term is a cyclic permutation of the down spin. So the state is symmetric under cyclic permutation, but not entirely symmetric since the down spin can be in any position.

Wait, actually, considering that the total spin state is symmetric under permutation of particles. Because if you permute the particles, the state remains the same. For example, swapping particle 1 and 2 in the first term gives up2 up1 down3, which is the second term. Similarly, permuting 1,2,3 cyclically would take each term to the next. So the state is fully symmetric under permutation of the particles. So that might be helpful.

Given that, perhaps the expectation values will simplify.

Moreover, since the state is symmetric, maybe we can compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for any pair (i,j).

So let's compute <S1·S2>.

First, note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z.

So <S1·S2> = (1/2)<psi| S1^+ S2^- |psi> + (1/2)<psi| S1^- S2^+ |psi> + <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>

But since the state |psi> is symmetric under permutation, what's the expectation value of S1^+ S2^-? Since S1^+ raises the spin of particle 1, and S2^- lowers the spin of particle 2. But in |psi>, each term has exactly one down spin, and the others are up. So if I apply S1^+ to a term where particle 1 is down, it would create a double down, but in |psi>, all terms have only one down spin. Similarly, S2^- would lower a spin that's already up, so it would take it to down.

Wait, let me think. Wait, in |psi>, each term has exactly one down spin. So if I apply S1^+ to a term where particle 1 is up, it can't do anything—it would be zero. If particle 1 is down, S1^+ acting on it would create a spin-up for particle 1 and a spin-up for particle 1, but in the context of the state, that would require the other particles to remain in their state.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the state in terms of the total spin operators.

But let me note that for spin 1/2 particles, the total spin squared, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So that gives us:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2

So H = A*( [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2 )

Therefore, to compute <H>, we can write it as (A/2)( <S_total^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> - <S3^2> )

Since each S_i^2 is (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2.

So, <H> = (A/2)( <S_total^2> - (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ħ² )

So <H> = (A/2)( <S_total^2> - (9/4)ħ² )

So if I can compute <S_total^2>, I can find the expectation value.

But how to compute <S_total^2>? Let's recall that S_total = S1 + S2 + S3.

So S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So that's consistent with earlier.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute <S_total^2> in the state |psi>.

But what is the total spin of |psi>?

Wait, |psi> is a state with two spins up and one spin down. Let me consider the possible total spins.

Each term in |psi> has two spins up and one spin down. The total spin S_z is 1/2 * 2 - 1/2 *1 = 1/2.

So S_z = 1/2.

But what is the total spin S? For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. Since we have S_z = 1/2, which is only possible for S=1/2 or S=3/2.

Wait, if S_z = 1/2, but in our state |psi>, when you have two up and one down spin, what is the multiplicity?

But each term in |psi> is symmetric, so the state is symmetric under permutation. So perhaps it's a triplet state? Or a singlet state.

But wait, in the case of three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states under permutation can have total spin S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be constructed as follows:

- The symmetric state with S=3/2: This is analogous to the triplet state in two particles, but for three particles. It has multiplicity (2S +1)=4, but for three spin 1/2 particles, the maximum S is 3/2.

- The symmetric state with S=1/2: It has multiplicity 2.

Wait, actually, the symmetric states with S=3/2 and S=1/2. So our |psi> has S_z = 1/2, so it must be part of either the S=3/2 or S=1/2 multiplets.

But wait, for S=3/2, the possible m_s are 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2. So in our state |psi>, the m_s is 1/2. So |psi> could be part of the S=3/2 multiplet or the S=1/2 multiplet.

But how can we tell?

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Since |psi> is a symmetric state, perhaps we can express it in terms of the total spin states.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, let's compute <S_total^2> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

Expanding that, we have:

<S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2<S1·S2> + 2<S1·S3> + 2<S2·S3>

But we already know that <S1^2> = <S2^2> = <S3^2> = (3/4) ħ².

So <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>)

Wait, but H = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>), so we can write <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

But also, from the expression above, <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2< H / A >

Wait, let me write that:

From H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), so S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = H / A.

Thus, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = <H> / A.

Then, <S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2*(<H> / A )

But also, from another perspective, what is <S_total^2> for the state |psi>?

Since |psi> has S_z = 1/2.

But wait, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then we can find its eigenvalue.

But is |psi> an eigenstate of S_total^2? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <S_total^2> directly.

Compute <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>.

Which is the same as (9/4) ħ² + 2*(<H>/A).

So we have <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2*(<H>/A).

But we also need another way to compute <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2>.

Wait, the state |psi> has two spins up and one spin down. So let's compute <S1^z>, <S2^z>, <S3^z>.

In |psi>, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So the expectation value of S_i^z is (1/2)(up) * 2/3? Wait, no.

Wait, let's calculate the expectation value <S_i^z>:

Each S_i^z can be either +1/2 or -1/2 in the computational basis.

In |psi>, each term has exactly one down spin, so in each term, the state is |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up>.

So, for each term, the expectation value of S_i^z is:

For the first term: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = -1/2.

Similarly, in the second term: S1^z = +1/2, S2^z = -1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

Third term: S1^z = -1/2, S2^z = +1/2, S3^z = +1/2.

So in each term, each S_i^z is +1/2 twice and -1/2 once. Wait, no:

Wait, in each term, two spins are up (+1/2) and one is down (-1/2). So for each S_i^z:

For each of the three terms, each S_i^z is +1/2 in two terms and -1/2 in one term.

Wait, let's be precise.

Take S1^z. In the first term, S1 is up, in the second term, S1 is up, in the third term, S1 is down.

So <S1^z> = (1/3)[(+1/2) + (+1/2) + (-1/2)] = (1/3)(0) = 0.

Similarly, <S2^z> = 0, and <S3^z> = 0. So the expectation value of each S_i^z is zero.

So the expectation value of S_total^z is zero, which is consistent with S_z = 1/2? Wait, no. Wait, the state |psi> has S_z = 1/2, but the expectation value of S_total^z is zero? That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, |psi> is (up1 up2 down3 + up1 down2 up3 + down1 up2 up3)/sqrt(3). So each term contributes to the expectation value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of S_total^z.

But wait, S_total^z = S1^z + S2^z + S3^z.

In each term of |psi>, two spins are up, so S_i^z = +1/2, and one spin is down, so S_j^z = -1/2.

Therefore, in each term, S_total^z = +1/2 + +1/2 -1/2 = +1/2.

So each of the three terms in |psi> has S_total^z = +1/2.

Therefore, <S_total^z> = (1/3)(+1/2 + +1/2 + +1/2) = (1/3)(3/2) = 1/2.

Which is consistent. So S_z = 1/2.

But for S_total^2, we need to compute <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2>.

Which expands to S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We already know that S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ħ², so their sum is (9/4)ħ².

Thus, <S_total^2> = (9/4)ħ² + 2< S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 >.

But from the Hamiltonian, we have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

Therefore, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = <H>/A.

Thus, plugging back into the expression for <S_total^2>:

<S_total^2> = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(<H>/A)

So we have <S_total^2> = (9/4)ħ² + (2/A)<H>

But also, from the definition, <S_total^2> = <S|S(S+1)ħ²> = S(S+1)ħ².

Therefore, if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then <S_total^2> = S(S+1)ħ².

But is |psi> an eigenstate of S_total^2?

I think it's not necessarily an eigenstate. Let's check.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the value of S(S+1) for |psi>.

Given that |psi> has S_z = 1/2, possible S is 3/2 or 1/2.

If |psi> is part of the S=3/2 multiplet, then S=3/2, so S(S+1)= (3/2)(5/2)=15/4.

If |psi> is part of the S=1/2 multiplet, then S=1/2, so S(S+1)=3/4.

But is |psi> symmetric enough to be in a higher spin multiplet?

Wait, |psi> is symmetric under permutation, but in the S=3/2 multiplet, the states are symmetric as well. The S=3/2 multiplet has four states: m=3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

So |psi> has m=1/2, so it's one of the four states in S=3/2.

Wait, but wait: for three spin-1/2 particles, the S=3/2 states have m_s = 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.

Each of these states is symmetric under permutation. So |psi> is symmetric, so it must be part of the S=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, how about the S=1/2 states? For three spin-1/2 particles, the S=1/2 states have m_s=1/2, -1/2, -3/2, -1/2 (wait, actually, for S=1/2, m_s can be -1/2, +1/2). Wait, no, for spin S, m_s can be from -S to +S in integer steps.

So for S=1/2, m_s= -1/2, +1/2.

But in our case, |psi> has m_s=1/2. So it can be part of either S=3/2 or S=1/2.

But for three spin-1/2 particles, the S=3/2 states are symmetric, while the S=1/2 states are antisymmetric?

Wait, no, symmetric and antisymmetric refers to the permutation symmetry, not the spin multiplets.

Wait, actually, for spin 1/2 particles, the singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1) for two particles are symmetric and antisymmetric respectively.

But for three particles, the situation is more complex.

Wait, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2, and for each total spin, the states can be symmetric or antisymmetric under permutation.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For three spin 1/2 particles, coupling them step by step. First, couple two spins to S=1/2 or 3/2, and then couple that with the third spin.

So, coupling two spins to S=1/2:

Then the total spin S_total can be 1/2 ⊗ 1/2 = 0 or 1.

But wait, no: when you couple S=1/2 and S=1/2, you can get S=1 or S=0.

Similarly, if you have S=3/2 for two spins, then coupling with third spin 1/2 gives S= 3/2 + 1/2 = 2 or 3/2 -1/2 = 1.

Wait, so maybe the possible total spins are 2, 3/2, 1, 0.

But for three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are S=2, 3/2, 1, 0.

Wait, but in our case, the state |psi> has m_s=1/2, so it's not part of S=2 or S=0, because those have m_s=2 or 0, and 0 only.

So it must be part of either S=3/2 or S=1.

But wait, S=1 has m_s=1, 0, -1. So m_s=1/2 is not possible for S=1.

Wait, so |psi> must be part of S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Wait, S=1/2 is possible? Because m_s=1/2 is in S=1/2.

Wait, for S=1/2, m_s can be -1/2, +1/2. So yes, m_s=1/2 is possible.

But for three spin-1/2 particles, the S=1/2 state is a singlet? No, the singlet is S=0. So all the symmetric states under permutation are higher spin.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the states transform under permutation.

The state |psi> is symmetric under permutation of the particles, so it must belong to the symmetric subspace.

Now, for three spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace has dimension 4.

Wait, no: the symmetric subspace is the subspace that is invariant under permutation. Since the total number of states is 8, the symmetric subspace has dimension 4.

The antisymmetric subspace would have dimension 4 as well, but that's for spin 1/2 particles.

Wait, but in our case, all three particles are spin 1/2, so the symmetric subspace has dimension 4.

The total spin state can have S=2, 3/2, 1, 0.

So in the symmetric subspace, S=2 and S=3/2. Because S=0 and S=1 are in the antisymmetric subspace?

Wait, no, S=0 is a singlet, which is symmetric or antisymmetric?

Wait, the singlet S=0 is symmetric under exchange, because swapping two particles gives a state that is (-1)^S times the original. So S=0 would be symmetric (since (-1)^0=1). But actually, swapping two spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state would leave it invariant.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet is symmetric under exchange.

Wait, in two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is (up down - down up)/sqrt(2), which is antisymmetric.

Wait, no, the singlet state is (up down - down up)/sqrt(2), which is antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, then, the triplet states are symmetric under exchange.

So for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet is antisymmetric, and the triplet is symmetric.

So for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet S=0 is not possible because it would require three particles to be in a singlet, which is not possible.

Wait, but the S=0 state would require that all three particles are in a singlet, but for two particles at a time, the singlet is antisymmetric.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the value of S(S+1) for |psi>.

If |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, which I don't know, but let's suppose it is.

Given that, let me try to compute <S_total^2> for |psi> in two different ways.

First, from the expansion:

<S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

But, from the Hamiltonian, we have:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So <H> = A*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

So <S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> = <H>/A

Therefore, plugging back into the expression for <S_total^2>:

<S_total^2> = (9/4) ħ² + 2(<H>/A )

But if |psi> is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then <S_total^2> = S(S+1) ħ²

So,

S(S+1) ħ² = (9/4) ħ² + (2/A)<H>

But I don't know S(S+1) or <H> yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute <S1·S2>.

Since S1·S2 = (1/4)[(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/2) ħ² ]

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/4)<(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/8) ħ²

Similarly for <S1·S3> and <S2·S3>.

So let me compute <(S1 + S2)^2> and similar.

Expanding (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2

So <(S1 + S2)^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + 2 <S1·S2>

But we know <S1^2> = <S2^2> = (3/4) ħ²

So <(S1 + S2)^2> = (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> = (3/2) ħ² + 2 <S1·S2>

Therefore,

< S1·S2 > = [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/2) ħ² ] / 2

Thus, plugging back into the expression for <S1·S2>:

<S1·S2> = [ (3/2 ħ² + 2 <S1·S2> ) - (3/2 ħ²) ] / 2

Wait, that seems circular.

Wait, maybe another approach.

We can use that:

< S1·S2 > = [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - <S1^2> - <S2^2> ] / 2

Which is [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² ] / 2

As we have:

< S1·S2 > = [ <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/2) ħ² ] / 2

Similarly for the others.

But I need to compute <(S1 + S2)^2>.

To compute <(S1 + S2)^2>, perhaps I can relate it to the total spin.

Wait, S1 + S2 = S_total - S3

So (S1 + S2)^2 = (S_total - S3)^2 = S_total^2 - 2 S_total S3 + S3^2

Therefore, <(S1 + S2)^2> = < S_total^2 > - 2 < S_total S3 > + < S3^2 >

But S3^2 = (3/4) ħ², so < S3^2 > = (3/4) ħ².

Also, < S_total S3 > = < S_total^z S3^z + (1/2)(S_total^+ S3^- + S_total^- S3^+ ) >

So to compute < S_total S3 >, I need the expectation value of S_total^z, S_total^+ S3^-, and S_total^- S3^+.

From earlier, we have < S_total^z > = 1/2.

But what about < S_total^+ S3^- > and < S_total^- S3^+ >.

Hmm.

Let me see.

First, S_total^+ is the operator that increases the total spin z-component by 1. S3^- is the operator that decreases the spin of particle 3 by 1.

In our state |psi>, each term has one down spin and two up spins. So in each term, one of the particles is down, two are up.

So, for the term up1 up2 down3, S_total^+ acting on it would give:

S_total^+ = S1^+ + S2^+ + S3^+

So S_total^+ |up up down> = (S1^+ |up> ) |up down> + (S2^+ |up> ) |up down> + (S3^+ |down> ) |up up>

But S1^+ |up> = 0, same for S2^+ |up> = 0, and S3^+ |down> = |up>.

Thus, S_total^+ |up up down> = |up up up>.

Similarly, other terms:

S_total^+ |up down up> = |up up up>,

S_total^+ |down up up> = |up up up>,

So for each term in |psi>, S_total^+ |term> = |up up up>.

So < S_total^+ S3^- > = <psi| S_total^+ S3^- |psi>

But S3^- |...> is |...down>, so S3^- acting on |up up up> is |up up down>.

But in |psi>, each term is |up up down>, |up down up>, |down up up>.

So S3^- |up up up> = |up up down>,

Similarly, S3^- |up down up> = |up down down>,

But |up down down> is not in |psi>, since |psi> only has terms with two up and one down.

Wait, so let me compute < S_total^+ S3^- >.

First, S3^- S_total^+ = S3^- (S1^+ + S2^+ + S3^+ )

So S3^- S_total^+ |psi> = S3^- S1^+ |psi> + S3^- S2^+ |psi> + S3^- S3^+ |psi>

Compute each term:

S3^- S1^+ |psi> = S3^- (S1^+ |psi> )

But in |psi>, each term has S1^z up or down.

Wait, S1^+ |psi> will lower some terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix elements.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute < S_total S3 >.

Since S_total = S1 + S2 + S3,

So S_total S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3) S3 = S1 S3 + S2 S3 + S3^2.

Thus, < S_total S3 > = < S1 S3 > + < S2 S3 > + < S3^2 >

We know that < S3^2 > = (3/4) ħ².

So we need to compute < S1 S3 > and < S2 S3 >.

But S1 S3 = (1/4)[ (S1 + S3)^2 - (3/2) ħ² ]

So, < S1 S3 > = (1/4)<(S1 + S3)^2> - (3/8) ħ²

Similarly, < S2 S3 > = (1/4)<(S2 + S3)^2> - (3/8) ħ²

Therefore, to compute < S_total S3 >, we need <(S1 + S3)^2> and <(S2 + S3)^2>

But as before, (S1 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S3^2 + 2 S1 S3

So <(S1 + S3)^2> = < S1^2 > + < S3^2 > + 2 < S1 S3 >

Which is (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² + 2 < S1 S3 > = (3/2) ħ² + 2 < S
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state psi is given as 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of E.

First, let me recall what eigenfunctions and eigenvalues mean. An eigenfunction of an operator is a function that only changes by a scalar factor when that operator is applied to it. So, if H psi = E psi, then psi is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue E. If not, then I need to compute the expectation value, which is the average energy when the system is in state psi.

The Hamiltonian H is a sum of dot products of spin operators. Each term S_i·S_j is equal to (1/2)(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+) + S_i^z S_j^z. But maybe there's a simpler way to handle this. I remember that for spin systems, S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2). So perhaps I can rewrite H in terms of the total spin squared.

Let me try that. The total spin squared is (S_total)^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding this, we get:

S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

So, plugging this into the Hamiltonian H:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 )

Since S1, S2, S3 are spin 1/2 particles, S1^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Similarly for S2^2 and S3^2. So each S_i^2 is 3/4 ħ².

Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ² = (9/4)ħ².

So plugging this into H:

H = A*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)/2 = (A/2)(S_total^2 - (9/4)ħ²)

Thus, H can be written as (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(9/4)ħ².

So, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8)ħ²

Now, to find if psi is an eigenfunction, I need to see if H psi is proportional to psi. If yes, then it's an eigenfunction. If not, then it isn't.

Alternatively, since H can be rewritten in terms of S_total^2, perhaps it's easier to compute the total spin squared of the state psi.

To do this, I need to determine the total spin S_total squared acting on psi.

First, let me find the total spin S_total^2. For a system of three spin 1/2 particles, the total spin can be either 3/2 or 1/2. The state psi is a symmetric state under permutation of particles, but let me check its symmetry.

Wait, actually, the state psi is given as a combination of three terms: each term has two spins up and one spin down. The coefficients are all 1/sqrt(3). Let me check the permutation symmetry.

If I swap particles 1 and 2, the first term becomes up2*up1*down3, which is the same as the second term. Similarly, swapping 1 and 3, the first term becomes up3*up1*down2, which is the third term. So, the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles. Hmm, but wait, actually, if you swap particles, does the state remain the same?

Wait, let's write the state:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

If I swap particles 1 and 2, the state becomes (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↑↓⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ] which is not the same as psi. Wait, no, swapping 1 and 2 changes |↑↑↓⟩ to |↑↑↓⟩ (since particles 1 and 2 are both up in that term). Wait, actually, no, swapping particles 1 and 2 in |↑↑↓⟩ would result in |↑↑↓⟩ because both are up. Similarly, swapping 1 and 2 in |↑↓↑⟩ would result in |↓↑↑⟩, which is the third term. So, the state psi is actually symmetric under permutation of any two particles.

Therefore, the state psi is symmetric under any permutation of particles. That suggests that the total spin is likely to be higher. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

If a state is symmetric under permutations, it's often part of the higher spin multiplet. Let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states form the triplet state with total spin 3/2, and the antisymmetric states form the singlet state with total spin 0.

Wait, actually, no. For three particles, each with spin 1/2, the symmetric states under permutation can have total spin 3/2 or 1/2.

Let me think. The triplet state for three particles is actually a symmetric state with total spin 3/2, and the singlet state is antisymmetric with total spin 0. So, if our state is symmetric, it must be part of the triplet state with S_total = 3/2.

Is our state psi part of that triplet? Let's try to see.

The triplet state for three spin 1/2 particles is |S=3/2, m_s=3/2⟩, which is |↑↑↑⟩. Wait, but psi has two ups and one down. So, it's not the same as the triplet state.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of constructing the states. The triplet states are all symmetric combinations of the three spins. Let's recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric states are:

1. |↑↑↑⟩ (which is the m_s = 3/2 state)
2. (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3) (which is the m_s = 1/2 state)
3. (|↑↓↓⟩ + |↓↑↓⟩ + |↓↓↑⟩)/sqrt(3) (m_s = -1/2 state)
4. |↓↓↓⟩ (m_s = -3/2 state)

Wait, but psi is exactly the second state: (|↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩)/sqrt(3). So, psi is the m_s = 1/2 state of the triplet with S_total = 3/2.

Therefore, if that's the case, then S_total^2 |psi⟩ = ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ² |psi⟩ = (15/4) ħ² |psi⟩.

Wait, S_total^2 acting on the state gives S_total(S_total +1)ħ² times the state. So, yes, if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ² = 15/4 ħ².

Therefore, going back to the Hamiltonian:

H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8)ħ²

So, H psi = (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) psi - (9A/8)ħ² psi = [ (15A/8) ħ² - (9A/8) ħ² ] psi = (6A/8) ħ² psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi.

Therefore, H psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi.

Thus, psi is an eigenfunction of H with eigenvalue (3A/4) ħ².

Wait, but the user said the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². Hmm, let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Hamiltonian.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps:

We have H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Expressed in terms of S_total^2:

S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2

So, H = A*( [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2]/2 )

Since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4) ħ², as each is spin 1/2.

So, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4) ħ² = 9/4 ħ².

Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - 9/4 ħ²)/2 = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

So, yes, that's correct.

Now, psi is the m_s = 1/2 state in the triplet state with total spin S_total = 3/2.

So, S_total^2 psi = ( (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ) ħ² psi = (15/4) ħ² psi.

Therefore, H psi = (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi.

Compute the coefficients:

15/(4*2) = 15/8, and 9/8 is just 9/8.

So, 15/8 ħ² A - 9/8 ħ² A = (6/8) ħ² A = (3/4) ħ² A.

Therefore, H psi = (3/4) ħ² A psi.

Thus, psi is indeed an eigenfunction of H with eigenvalue (3/4) ħ² A.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ², without the factor of 1/2? Wait, in my calculation, I have (3/4) ħ² A.

But let me double-check.

Wait, let me see:

Compute H psi = (A/2) S_total^2 psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi.

Since S_total^2 psi = (15/4) ħ² psi,

So, (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) = (15A)/(8) ħ².

Then subtract (9A/8) ħ²:

15A/8 - 9A/8 = 6A/8 = 3A/4.

So yes, that's correct. So H psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi.

Therefore, the energy eigenvalue is (3A/4) ħ².

Wait, but the user says the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ². Maybe the user forgot to include the factor of 1/2 somewhere? Or did I miss something?

Wait, let me go back.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the state is an eigenstate.

Wait, another approach is to compute the expectation value directly.

Compute ⟨psi| H |psi⟩.

Given H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, the expectation value is A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩)

Since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩. So, we can compute one and multiply by 3.

So, compute ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(⟨S1^+ S2^-⟩ + ⟨S1^- S2^+⟩ + ⟨S1^z S2^z⟩ )

But maybe using the formula S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)

So, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = [⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S_i^2⟩ - ⟨S_j^2⟩]/2

Compute each term:

⟨S_total^2⟩: Since psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, it's just (15/4) ħ²

⟨S_i^2⟩ = (3/4) ħ² for each i.

Thus,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = [15/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²]/2 = [15/4 - 3/4 - 3/4] ħ² / 2 = [9/4] ħ² / 2 = 9/8 ħ²

Then, the expectation value of H is A*(3*(9/8) ħ² ) = (27/8) A ħ².

Wait, that contradicts my previous result.

Hmm, that can't be, because earlier when I used H psi = E psi, I obtained (3A/4) ħ², but when computing expectation value directly, I get 27/8 A ħ².

So, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in the expression for H.

Wait, let me clarify:

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Expressed in terms of S_total^2, we have S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Therefore, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (A/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 )

Which is what I had before.

Given that, then H psi = (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) psi - (A/2)(9/4 ħ²) psi

So, (15A/8) ħ² psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi = (6A/8) ħ² psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi

Thus, E = 3A/4 ħ²

But when computing expectation value:

⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩ )

Since all ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ are the same, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = [⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ ] / 2

⟨S_total^2⟩ is (15/4) ħ²

⟨S1^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ²

Thus,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (15/4 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 * ħ² = (9/4)/2 * ħ² = 9/8 ħ²

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(3 * 9/8 ħ² ) = 27/8 A ħ²

Wait, but that's different from the eigenvalue. That suggests my earlier conclusion that psi is an eigenfunction must be wrong, because if psi were an eigenfunction, then the expectation value would equal the eigenvalue. But 27/8 ≠ 3/4.

So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that S_total^2 acting on psi gives 15/4 ħ² psi is incorrect.

Wait, no, because S_total^2 acts on the triplet states as I thought. So, if psi is the m_s =1/2 state in the triplet with S_total =3/2, then S_total^2 should have eigenvalue (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ² = (15/4) ħ². So that part seems correct.

But why is there a discrepancy in expectation value?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H is written in terms of S_total^2, but H is only a function of S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3. So, when I express H in terms of S_total^2, I have H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, I get 27/8 A ħ², which is different from (A/2)(15/4) ħ² - 9A/8 ħ² = (15A/8 -9A/8) ħ² = 6A/8 ħ² = 3A/4 ħ².

Wait, so the expectation value according to H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ² is 3A/4 ħ², but when I compute via S1·S2 etc., I get 27/8 A ħ².

Thus, the only conclusion is that my initial assumption that H psi = E psi is wrong. Therefore, psi is not an eigenfunction of H.

But wait, if H is equal to (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ², and S_total^2 psi = 15/4 ħ² psi, then H psi = (A/2)(15/4) ħ² psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi = (15A/8 - 9A/8) ħ² psi = 6A/8 ħ² psi = 3A/4 ħ² psi.

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, I get 27/8 A ħ², which is 3.375 A ħ², whereas 3/4 is 0.75.

Wait, 3A/4 is 0.75 A ħ², but 27/8 is 3.375. So, they can't both be correct.

This suggests that either the state is not an eigenfunction, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute H acting on psi directly, without using S_total^2.

Alternatively, compute the expectation value directly by expanding the action of H on psi.

Let me try that.

First, let me note that H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, H psi = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) psi

I need to compute S1·S2 psi, S1·S3 psi, S2·S3 psi, add them, multiply by A, and see if it's proportional to psi.

Alternatively, compute each term:

Compute S1·S2 psi:

S1·S2 = S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z

Similarly, S1·S3 and S2·S3.

So, H psi is a combination of terms involving these operators acting on psi.

But since S_i^z acting on |↑⟩ gives ±ħ |↑⟩ and on |↓⟩ gives ∓ħ |↓⟩.

So, perhaps I can compute each component.

Let me write psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt(3)) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Let me denote |a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩, |b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩, |c⟩ = |↓↑↑⟩.

So, psi = (|a⟩ + |b⟩ + |c⟩)/sqrt(3)

Now, compute S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 acting on psi.

First, compute S1·S2:

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^+ S2^- + S1^- S2^+) + S1^z S2^z

Similarly for other terms.

But maybe it's easier to compute S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 on each basis state.

Compute S1·S2 |a⟩:

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1^z |a⟩ = +ħ |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S2^z |a⟩ = +ħ |↑↑↓⟩.

Compute S1^+ S2^- |a⟩:

S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0, since it's already up.

So, S1^+ S2^- |a⟩ = 0.

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |a⟩:

S1^- |↑⟩ = 0, so S1^- S2^+ |a⟩ = 0.

Therefore, S1·S2 |a⟩ = (0 + 0 + S1^z S2^z |a⟩ ) = ħ² |a⟩

Similarly, compute S1·S2 |b⟩:

|b⟩ = |↑↓↑⟩

S1^z |b⟩ = +ħ |↑↓↑⟩

S2^z |b⟩ = -ħ |↑↓↑⟩

Now, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑⟩:

S1^+ |↑⟩ = 0

S2^- |↓⟩ = 0

Therefore, S1^+ S2^- |b⟩ = 0

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |b⟩:

S1^- |↑⟩ = 0

S2^+ |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, but since S2 acts on the second particle:

Wait, perhaps it's better to write S1^+ S2^- = S1^+ acting on first spin, S2^- acting on second.

So, S1^+ S2^- |↑↓↑⟩ = S1^+ |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^- |↓↑⟩ = 0 ⊗ 0 = 0

Similarly, S1^- S2^+ |↑↓↑⟩ = S1^- |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^+ |↓↑⟩ = 0 ⊗ |↑↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩ ⊗ something?

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: express S1·S2 in terms of matrices.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that for two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² )

Wait, let me recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2 )

Wait, but S1^2 + S2^2 = (3/4 + 3/4) ħ² = (3/2) ħ².

Wait, no, wait: for two spin 1/2 particles,

S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

But S_total^2 can be 0 or 2 ħ² (since total spin 0 or 1).

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the total spin S_total can be 1 (triplet) or 0 (singlet).

Thus, in the triplet state (S_total=1), S1·S2 = (1/2)(2 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² )? Wait, no.

Wait, S1^2 = (3/4) ħ², same for S2^2.

Thus, S1·S2 = (1/2)( S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 ) = (1/2)( S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ² ) = (1/2)( S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ² )

So, for the triplet state (S_total=1), S1·S2 = (1/2)(2 ħ² - 3/2 ħ² ) = (1/2)(1/2 ħ² ) = 1/4 ħ².

For the singlet state (S_total=0), S1·S2 = (1/2)(0 - 3/2 ħ² ) = -3/4 ħ².

But going back, in our case, for three particles, the state psi is a triplet state with S_total=3/2.

But when we're looking at S1·S2 acting on psi, which is a state where particles 1 and 2 are both up in some cases and one down.

Wait, perhaps it's still tricky.

Alternatively, since I already have two different results, one from H psi = E psi, and another from computing ⟨H⟩, which are conflicting, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think.

If psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H psi should be proportional to psi, but when I compute H psi, it's 3/4 A ħ² psi.

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, it's 27/8 A ħ². So, 3/4 ≈ 0.75 and 27/8 ≈ 3.375.

Thus, the expectation value is not equal to the eigenvalue, implying that the state is not an eigenstate.

Therefore, my initial assumption that S_total^2 psi = 15/4 ħ² psi is wrong.

Wait, but why would that be?

Wait, no, because in the triplet state, S_total^2 is indeed 15/4 ħ².

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let's think again. If I have three spin 1/2 particles in the state psi, which is symmetric, so it's the m_s=1/2 state in the triplet state with S=3/2.

Therefore, S_total^2 psi = (3/2)(3/2 +1) ħ² psi = (15/4) ħ² psi.

Thus, H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ²

So, H psi = (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi

= (15A/8) ħ² psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi

= (6A/8) ħ² psi

= (3A/4) ħ² psi

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, I get 27/8 A ħ², which is different.

Thus, this suggests that H psi is not equal to E psi, meaning that psi is not an eigenstate.

But if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, and H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, then H should act on psi as a multiple of psi.

So, this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expressing H in terms of S_total^2.

Wait, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( [S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2 ] / 2 )

But in our case, H is given as H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, correct, that's the same as (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

But if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, then H should act on psi by scaling it, unless the other term affects it.

Wait, but (9A/8) ħ² is a scalar, so when H acts on psi, it's a linear combination of scaling psi and adding a scalar multiple.

But if H psi is (15A/8) ħ² psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi, which is 6A/8 ħ² psi, that's still proportional to psi.

Therefore, H psi should be proportional to psi, meaning psi is an eigenstate.

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, I get a different value.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing ⟨H⟩.

Wait, let me recompute ⟨H⟩.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So, ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S1·S2⟩ + ⟨S1·S3⟩ + ⟨S2·S3⟩ )

Since the state is symmetric, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = ⟨S1·S3⟩ = ⟨S2·S3⟩ = same value.

So, ⟨H⟩ = 3A*⟨S1·S2⟩

Now, compute ⟨S1·S2⟩.

As before, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 )

So, ⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(⟨S_total^2⟩ - ⟨S1^2⟩ - ⟨S2^2⟩ )

We have ⟨S_total^2⟩ = 15/4 ħ²

⟨S1^2⟩ = 3/4 ħ²

Similarly for S2^2.

Thus,

⟨S1·S2⟩ = (1/2)(15/4 - 3/4 - 3/4) ħ² = (1/2)(9/4) ħ² = 9/8 ħ²

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ = 3A*(9/8) ħ² = 27/8 A ħ²

Which is different from the eigenvalue 3A/4 ħ².

Therefore, the conclusion is that my initial assumption that psi is an eigenstate of H is wrong.

Wait, but why? Because if H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, and psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2, why is H not acting as a multiple on psi?

Wait, perhaps because H is not only a function of S_total^2, but also includes the term - (9A/8) ħ², which is a constant. Therefore, H is not a multiple of S_total^2, but rather H = (A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/8) ħ².

Thus, when H acts on psi, it is (A/2)(15/4 ħ²) psi - (9A/8) ħ² psi.

But this is equal to (15A/8 - 9A/8) ħ² psi = (6A/8) ħ² psi = (3A/4) ħ² psi.

So, H psi is proportional to psi, hence psi is an eigenstate.

But when I compute ⟨H⟩, I get 27/8 A ħ², which is 3.375 A ħ².

But 3A/4 is 0.75 A ħ².

So, why are they different?

Wait, no, the expectation value of H is equal to ⟨H⟩ = ⟨psi| H |psi⟩.

But if H psi = E psi, then ⟨H⟩ = E.

So, if I have H psi = E psi, then E must equal ⟨H⟩.

But in my calculation, I have E = 3A/4 ħ², and ⟨H⟩ = 27/8 A ħ².

Which is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing H psi.

Wait, let me recast psi as a combination of |a⟩, |b⟩, |c⟩.

Compute S1·S2 |a⟩, S1·S3 |a⟩, S2·S3 |a⟩, and same for |b⟩, |c⟩.

But given that S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3 are spin operators, it's complicated. Maybe instead, let me compute each term.

Compute S1·S2 |a⟩:

As before, S1·S2 |a⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z) |a⟩

|a⟩ = |↑↑↓⟩

Compute S1^z |a⟩ = +ħ |↑↑↓⟩

Compute S2^z |a⟩ = +ħ |↑↑↓⟩

Compute S1^x S2^x |a⟩:

S1^x |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2 * ħ ?

Wait, no, wait: S^x = ħ (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/2

So, S1^x |↑⟩ = (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2 * ħ ?

Wait, no, S^x acting on |↑⟩ is (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2 * ħ.

Wait, no, S^x = (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|)/2 * ħ

Therefore, S1^x |↑⟩ = ħ ( |↓⟩ - |↑⟩ ) / 2

Similarly, S2^x |↑⟩ = ħ ( |↓⟩ - |↑⟩ ) / 2

Thus, S1^x S2^x |a⟩ = S1^x |↑↑↓⟩ = S1^x |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^x |↑⟩

= (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2 ⊗ (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2

= (|↓↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩)/4

Similarly, S1^y S2^y |a⟩:

S^y = -i (|↑⟩⟨↓| - |↓⟩⟨↑|)/2

Thus, S1^y |↑⟩ = -i (|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2

Similarly for S2^y |↑⟩.

Thus, S1^y S2^y |a⟩ = S1^y |↑⟩ ⊗ S2^y |↑⟩

= (-i)(|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2 ⊗ (-i)(|↓⟩ - |↑⟩)/2

= (-i)^2 (|↓↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩ ) /4

= (-1)(|↓↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ + |↑↑⟩ ) /4

= (-|↓↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ + |↑↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩ ) /4

Then, S1^z S2^z |a⟩ = (ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩

So, putting it all together:

S1·S2 |a⟩ = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z ) |a⟩

= [ (|↓↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩ +
[overthinking]
Okay, so I have this problem with three spin 1/2 particles, and the Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state ψ is given as 1/√3*(↑1↑2↓3 + ↑1↓2↑3 + ↓1↑2↑3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find its energy; if not, compute the expectation value of E.

First, I remember that for spin systems, especially with multiple particles, the dot product of spin operators S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin squared and individual spins. The formula S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2 comes to mind. So maybe I can rewrite H in terms of the total spin squared.

Let me denote S_total = S1 + S2 + S3. Then, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So, solving for S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 gives (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

Therefore, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. Since each S_i^2 is the square of the spin operator for particle i, which for spin 1/2 particles is (ℏ/2)(ℏ/2 + 1) = (3/4)ℏ^2. So each S_i^2 = (3/4)ℏ^2.

So, S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = (3/4)ℏ^2 each. Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 = (9/4)ℏ^2.

So, H becomes A/2*(S_total^2 - (9/4)ℏ^2). Therefore, H = (A/2)*S_total^2 - (A/2)*(9/4)ℏ^2. That simplifies to H = (A/2)S_total^2 - (9A/8)ℏ^2.

So, if I can figure out the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the given state ψ, I can figure out the expectation value of H.

Now, let's think about the state ψ. It's given as a symmetric combination of three terms where two spins are up and one is down. Let me denote the three possible configurations where two are up and one is down.

Wait, actually, the state ψ is 1/√3*(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑). Let me confirm that. Yes, it's a symmetric combination of all permutations where two spins are up and one is down.

Now, in terms of total spin, this state is likely in the symmetric spin state. Since each term has two up and one down, it's similar to the triplet state. For three spin 1/2 particles, the possible total spin states can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2.

Wait, actually, when you have three spin-1/2 particles, the total spin S can be 3/2 or 1/2. The symmetric combinations are usually the triplet states with S = 3/2, while the antisymmetric are the singlet states with S = 1/2. But in this case, the state ψ is symmetric because it's a sum of all permutations, so it should be a triplet state with S = 3/2.

Wait, hold on. For three spin 1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states are for pairs. But here, it's three particles. For three particles, the possible total spin states are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2, which are determined by the symmetry under permutation of spins.

So, if the state is symmetric under permutation, it should be in the S = 3/2 multiplet. The multiplicity is 2S + 1, so for S = 3/2, we have 4 states, and for S = 1/2, we have 2 states.

But wait, our state ψ is a combination of three terms, each with two up and one down. So, is that a singlet or triplet state?

Wait, perhaps I need to better understand the structure of these states. Let me consider the three possible states where two spins are up and one is down.

Each term in ψ has two up spins and one down spin, so ψ is a symmetric combination of all such terms. However, when dealing with three spin-1/2 particles, such a state would belong to the S=1/2 or S=3/2 representation?

Wait, actually, I think for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has total spin S=1/2, but the triplet states have S=3/2.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. For two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet is S=0 and triplet is S=1. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins can be 3/2 or 1/2.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the total spin squared, S_total^2, for the state ψ. If I can find its eigenvalue, that would help.

The eigenvalues of S_total^2 are S(S+1)ℏ^2, where S is the total spin.

So, if the state is an eigenfunction of S_total^2, then H can be computed easily.

So, how do I compute <S_total^2> for ψ?

Wait, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Therefore, to find <S_total^2>, I can compute the expectation values of S1^2, S2^2, S3^2, and S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

But from earlier, each S_i^2 is (3/4)ℏ^2. So, the expectation value of S1^2 is (3/4)ℏ^2, same for S2^2 and S3^2.

So, <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 = (9/4)ℏ^2.

Now, for the cross terms, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>, which is equal to <(S_total)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)> / 2.

Wait, hold on, that's not helpful because I just have that relationship.

Alternatively, I can compute each <S_i·S_j> separately.

So, let's compute <S1·S2>, <S1·S3>, and <S2·S3>.

Each of these can be computed using the expectation value of the spin operators.

But since the state is a symmetric combination, perhaps each <S_i·S_j> will be the same.

Let me test that.

First, for each pair (i,j), the operator S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, S_i·S_j = 1/2*(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_ij^2), where S_ij is the total spin of particles i and j.

Hmm, but perhaps an easier way is to recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be calculated as (s_i(s_i + 1) - 3/4)ℏ^2, but wait, that seems unclear.

Alternatively, since S_i·S_j = ( (S_i + S_j)^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2 ) / 2.

So, for each pair (i,j), S_i·S_j can be expressed in terms of the total spin of that pair and the individual spins.

Given that, let me focus on a single pair, say particles 1 and 2.

What is the expectation value <ψ|S1·S2|ψ>?

Since ψ is a symmetric combination of three states, each with two up spins and one down spin, let's compute the expectation value.

Wait, perhaps I can write out the action of S1·S2 on ψ.

Wait, S1·S2 is (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2), where S_total_12 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2.

So, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2).

So, the expectation value <S1·S2> = (1/2)(<S1^2> + <S2^2> - <S_total_12^2>).

Since <S1^2> = <S2^2> = (3/4)ℏ^2, this becomes (1/2)*(3/4 + 3/4 - <S_total_12^2>).

So, <S1·S2> = (1/2)*(6/4 - <S_total_12^2>) = (3/4 - (1/2)<S_total_12^2>).

Now, what is <S_total_12^2> for the state ψ?

Well, S_total_12 is the total spin of particles 1 and 2. So, when I have particles 1 and 2 in a state, their total spin can be either S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet).

In the state ψ, particles 1 and 2 are each in a spin-up or spin-down state.

Looking at each term in ψ:

1. ↑↑↓: Here, particles 1 and 2 are both spin-up. So, S_total_12 for this term is 1*(1 + 1)ℏ^2 = 2ℏ^2. Because the spins are aligned, so S=1.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is S(S+1)ℏ^2. So, S=1 gives 2ℏ^2.

Similarly, for the other terms:

2. ↑↓↑: Particle 1 is up, particle 2 is down. So, for particles 1 and 2, their spins are opposite. So, S_total_12 is 0*(0 +1)ℏ^2 = 0.

3. ↓↑↑: Particle 1 is down, particle 2 is up. Again, opposite spins, so S_total_12 is 0*(0 +1)ℏ^2 = 0.

So, in the first term, particles 1 and 2 are in a triplet state (S=1), contributing 2ℏ^2. In the other two terms, they are in a singlet state, contributing 0.

But how does this affect the expectation value? Because the state ψ is a symmetric combination of all three possibilities, so each term in the sum will contribute equally.

Wait, actually, ψ is 1/√3*(term1 + term2 + term3). So, when we compute <S_total_12^2>, we have to compute the expectation over all three terms, each with equal weight.

So, the expectation value <S_total_12^2> is (1/3)*(2ℏ^2 + 0 + 0) = (2/3)ℏ^2.

Therefore, plugging back into <S1·S2>:

< S1·S2 > = (3/4 - (1/2)*(2/3)ℏ^2 ) = (3/4 - (1/3)ℏ^2 )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's see:

Hold on, my confusion is arising because I think I made a mistake in the unit. Let me clarify.

The spin operator S_i has units of ℏ, so S_i·S_j has units of ℏ^2. Therefore, the expectation value <S_i·S_j> has units of ℏ^2.

But in my earlier step, <S1·S2> = (3/4 - (1/2)<S_total_12^2>), but S1·S2 is 1/2*(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2). So, when I take the expectation, I have 1/2*( <S1^2> + <S2^2> - <S_total_12^2> ).

Which is 1/2*( (3/4)ℏ^2 + (3/4)ℏ^2 - <S_total_12^2> )

So, that is 1/2*( (6/4)ℏ^2 - <S_total_12^2> )

Which is (3/4)ℏ^2 - (1/2)<S_total_12^2>.

Then, plugging in <S_total_12^2> = (2/3)ℏ^2.

So, <S1·S2> = (3/4)ℏ^2 - (1/2)*(2/3)ℏ^2.

Compute that: 3/4 - (1/2)*(2/3) = 3/4 - 1/3 = (9/12 - 4/12) = 5/12.

So, <S1·S2> = (5/12)ℏ^2.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, hold on, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, S1·S2 = (S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2)/2.

Hence, <S1·S2> = ( <S1^2> + <S2^2> - <S_total_12^2> ) / 2.

So, plugging in:

( (3/4)ℏ^2 + (3/4)ℏ^2 - (2/3)ℏ^2 ) / 2.

Compute numerator: (6/4 - 2/3)ℏ^2.

Convert to common denominator, which is 12:

(18/12 - 8/12) = 10/12 = 5/6.

So, (5/6)ℏ^2 / 2 = (5/12)ℏ^2.

Yes, so that's correct. So, <S1·S2> = (5/12)ℏ^2.

Similarly, due to the symmetry of the state, <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> should also be equal to (5/12)ℏ^2 each.

Therefore, the sum <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> is 3*(5/12)ℏ^2 = (15/12)ℏ^2 = (5/4)ℏ^2.

Now, going back to the expression for H:

H = (A/2)S_total^2 - (9A/8)ℏ^2.

Therefore, to find <H>, I need <S_total^2>.

Which is equal to <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)>

So, substitute the known values:

<S_total^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> + 2*(<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>)

We already found <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = (9/4)ℏ^2.

And <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = (5/4)ℏ^2.

So, <S_total^2> = (9/4)ℏ^2 + 2*(5/4)ℏ^2 = (9/4 + 10/4)ℏ^2 = (19/4)ℏ^2.

So, <S_total^2> = (19/4)ℏ^2.

Therefore, plugging back into H:

<H> = (A/2)*(19/4)ℏ^2 - (9A/8)ℏ^2.

Compute this:

First term: (19A/8)ℏ^2.

Second term: (9A/8)ℏ^2.

So, <H> = (19A/8 - 9A/8)ℏ^2 = (10A/8)ℏ^2 = (5A/4)ℏ^2.

Wait, but according to the given correct answer, it should be 3A/4 * ℏ^2. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, I might have messed up the computation of <S_total^2>.

Wait, <S_total^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> + 2*<S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>

We had <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 = 9/4 ℏ^2.

And <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> was 5/4 ℏ^2.

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2 + 2*(5/4)ℏ^2 = 9/4 + 10/4 = 19/4 ℏ^2.

So, that part is correct.

Then, H = (A/2) * (19/4) ℏ^2 - (9A/8)ℏ^2.

Compute:

(A/2)*(19/4) = (19A)/8.

So, (19A/8)ℏ^2 - (9A/8)ℏ^2 = (10A/8)ℏ^2 = (5A/4)ℏ^2.

Hmm, so according to this, the expectation value is (5A/4)ℏ^2.

But the given correct answer is 3A/4 ℏ^2. Hmm. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe my calculation of <S_total^2> is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute S_total^2 for the state ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S_total^2 in another way.

The state ψ is symmetric, so it should be in the S = 3/2 representation?

Wait, for three spin 1/2 particles, is ψ an eigenstate of S_total^2? That is, does it have well-defined S_total^2.

Wait, ψ is 1/√3*(↑↑↓ + ↑↓↑ + ↓↑↑). This is the same as the symmetric state with two up and one down spins.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about this state in terms of the total spin.

If I have three spins, each spin 1/2, the singlet state has S=1/2, with total spin 1/2. The triplet states have S=3/2.

Wait, but for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states are different. For two spins, we have singlet (S=0) and triplet (S=1). For three spins, the possible total spins are S=3/2 and S=1/2.

Wait, the singlet for three spins is actually a combination where the total spin is 1/2, and the triplet is 3/2.

But in our case, ψ is a symmetric state with two up and one down. Let me see what the total spin is.

Actually, the state ψ is the same as the state |0,0> in the two-up-one-down system.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can express ψ in terms of the total spin states.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for ψ.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute S_total^2 acting on ψ. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state ψ.

Wait, for S_total^2, the possible eigenvalues are (3/2)(3/2 + 1)ℏ^2 = (15/4)ℏ^2 and (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ^2 = (3/4)ℏ^2.

So, if ψ is an eigenstate, it must be either (15/4)ℏ^2 or (3/4)ℏ^2.

But let me compute <S_total^2> as we did before.

Wait, earlier I got <S_total^2> = (19/4)ℏ^2. But that's not one of the eigenvalues, which suggests that ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, hence not an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if ψ is a symmetric state, and symmetric states with two up and one down spin are in the S=3/2 multiplet, so they should be eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that I didn't compute <S_total^2> correctly.

Wait, so let me try again.

Since ψ is a symmetric state, and for three spin-1/2 particles, symmetric states under permutation of spins are the S=3/2 states. So, ψ should be an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue S=3/2, which is 15/4 ℏ^2.

But according to my previous calculation, <S_total^2> was 19/4 ℏ^2, which isn't 15/4. So, contradiction here.

Therefore, maybe my initial assumption that ψ is symmetric is incorrect.

Wait, no, ψ is given as a symmetric combination. So, it's symmetric under permutation of spins, hence it's in the S=3/2 multiplet.

Therefore, my earlier calculation must be wrong. Let me check.

I think the error is in considering S_total^2 as in the three-particle system, but I might have made a mistake in the computation of the cross terms.

Wait, let me recompute <S_total^2> step by step.

We have S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

So, the expectation value is <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

Now, <S1·S2> was calculated as (5/12)ℏ^2.

So, <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = 3*(5/12)ℏ^2 = (15/12)ℏ^2 = (5/4)ℏ^2.

So, <S_total^2> = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 + 2*(5/4)ℏ^2 = (9/4 + 10/4)ℏ^2 = (19/4)ℏ^2.

But if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total^2, this should equal S(S+1)ℏ^2, which for S=3/2 is 15/4 ℏ^2, or for S=1/2 is 3/4 ℏ^2.

So, my calculation is giving (19/4)ℏ^2, which is not equal to either. Therefore, ψ is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, hence not an eigenstate of H.

Wait, but this contradicts the expectation that symmetric states with two up and one down spin are part of the S=3/2 multiplet.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine whether ψ is indeed an eigenstate.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the action of S_total^2 on ψ.

Compute S_total^2 |ψ>.

Since S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2, we can write it as a combination of S1^2, S2^2, S3^2, and terms like S1·S2, etc.

But applying S_total^2 to ψ would involve applying each component to each term in ψ. That's going to be complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me write out |ψ> as (1/√3)(|↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>).

First, let me compute S1^2 |ψ>.

Since S1^2 is the square of the spin operator of particle 1, which is (ℏ/2)(ℏ/2 + 1) = (3/4)ℏ^2, same for S2^2 and S3^2.

So, S1^2 |ψ> = (3/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

Similarly, S2^2 |ψ> = (3/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>, and S3^2 |ψ> = (3/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

Now, let's compute the cross terms, like S1·S2 |ψ>.

As before, S1·S2 |ψ> = (1/2)(S1^2 + S2^2 - S_total_12^2)|ψ> = (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4)ℏ^2 - S_total_12^2 )|ψ>.

But as before, for each term in |ψ>, S_total_12^2 can be either 2ℏ^2 (when both are up) or 0 (when opposite).

So, for the first term |↑↑↓>, S_total_12^2 is 2ℏ^2.

For the second term |↑↓↑>, S_total_12^2 is 0.

For the third term |↓↑↑>, S_total_12^2 is 0.

So, S1·S2 |ψ> = (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4)ℏ^2 - (1/3)(2ℏ^2 + 0 + 0) ) |ψ>

= (1/2)( (6/4)ℏ^2 - (2/3)ℏ^2 ) |ψ>

= (1/2)( (18/12 - 8/12 )ℏ^2 ) |ψ>

= (1/2)(10/12 ℏ^2 ) |ψ>

= (5/12)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

Similarly, the action of S1·S3 on |ψ> is the same as S1·S2, because of the symmetry of the state.

So, S1·S3 |ψ> = (5/12)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

And S2·S3 |ψ> = (5/12)ℏ^2 |ψ> as well.

Therefore, S_total^2 |ψ> = (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)) |ψ>

= ( (3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4)ℏ^2 + 2*(5/12 + 5/12 + 5/12)ℏ^2 ) |ψ>

Compute the coefficients:

First part: 9/4 ℏ^2.

Second part: 2*(15/12)ℏ^2 = 2*(5/4)ℏ^2 = 10/4 ℏ^2 = 5/2 ℏ^2.

So, total coefficient: 9/4 + 5/2 = 9/4 + 10/4 = 19/4 ℏ^2.

So, S_total^2 |ψ> = (19/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

But earlier, I thought that for symmetric states, |ψ> should be an eigenstate with S=3/2, which would have eigenvalue (15/4)ℏ^2. But we see that S_total^2 |ψ> = (19/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>, which is not a multiple of |ψ>, hence it's not an eigenstate.

Wait, that suggests that |ψ> is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, contradicting my earlier thought that it should be in the S=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the state is in the triplet or singlet state. Wait, in three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state has S=1/2, and the triplet has S=3/2.

But wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the singlet is actually a combination with total spin 1/2, and the triplet has spin 3/2.

But our state |ψ> is a symmetric combination of two up and one down, which is more likely to be in the triplet (S=3/2) state.

But according to our calculation, S_total^2 |ψ> = (19/4)ℏ^2 |ψ>, which is not an eigenvalue of S_total^2 for S=3/2 or S=1/2.

Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is incorrect.

Wait, when I computed S1·S2 |ψ>, I got (5/12)ℏ^2 |ψ>.

But let me think again. Wait, S1·S2 acts on each term in |ψ>, and when S_total_12 is 2ℏ^2, it adds (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4 - 2 ) )ℏ^2.

Wait, S1·S2 |↑↑↓> = (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4 - 2 ) )ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> = (1/2)( (6/4 - 8/4 ))ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> = (1/2)(-2/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> = (-1/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓>.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>, S1·S2 |↑↓↑> = (1/2)( (3/4 + 3/4 - 0 ) )ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> = (1/2)(6/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> = (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑>.

Same for |↓↑↑>, S1·S2 |↓↑↑> = (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑>.

Therefore, the total S1·S2 |ψ> is:

( -1/4 )ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> all multiplied by 1/√3.

So, <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> would be:

(1/√3)( <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ) * ( -1/4 ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + 3/4 ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + 3/4 ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> ) * (1/√3).

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let me compute each term.

Wait, the state |ψ> is (|↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>)/√3.

So, S1·S2 |ψ> is S1·S2 * (|↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑>)/√3.

Which is [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> ] /√3.

Therefore, the inner product <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> is [ (1/√3)(<↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑|) ] * [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> ] * (1/√3).

Multiplying the coefficients:

(1/√3)(-1/4)ℏ^2 * <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> + (1/√3)(3/4)ℏ^2 * <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> + ... Similarly for others.

But <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> = 1, others are zero.

So, first term: (1/√3)(-1/4)ℏ^2 * 1.

Second term: (1/√3)(3/4)ℏ^2 * 0.

Third term: (1/√3)(3/4)ℏ^2 * 0.

Similarly, for the other terms:

Wait, actually, let's compute the entire inner product.

<ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (1/3) [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 <↓↑↑|↑↑↓> + similar terms from the other components ]

But each cross term like <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> is zero because the states are different.

So, only the diagonal terms survive.

Therefore, <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (1/3) [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 * 1 + (3/4)ℏ^2 * 0 + (3/4)ℏ^2 * 0 ] + similar from the other terms.

Wait, no, actually, hold on.

Wait, S1·S2 |ψ> is [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> ] /√3.

Then, <ψ|S1·S2|ψ> = (1/√3)(<↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑|) * [ (-1/4)ℏ^2 |↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↑↓↑> + (3/4)ℏ^2 |↓↑↑> ] /√3.

Multiplying the bra and ket:

= (1/3)[ (-1/4)ℏ^2 <↑↑↓|↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 <↑↓↑|↑↑↓> + (3/4)ℏ^2 <↓↑↑|↑↑↓> + ... ]

But only the terms where the bra and ket are the same survive. So, only the first term in the first bracket and similar terms in other brackets.

So, the total is (1/3)[ (-1/4)ℏ^2 *1 + (3/4)ℏ^2 *0 + (3/4)ℏ^2 *0 ] + same for the other terms.

But wait, actually, in the expansion, each term in the ket is multiplied by the corresponding coefficients.

Wait, it's getting too convoluted. Maybe
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem here about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant and Si are the spin operators for each particle. The state provided is psi = 1/sqrt(3)*(up1*up2*down3 + up1*down2*up3 + down1*up2*up3). I need to figure out if this state is an eigenfunction of H. If it is, find the energy; if not, find the expectation value of H.

First, I remember that spin 1/2 particles have spin operators S_i which are vectors. So S_i = (ħ/2) * σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. The dot product S_i·S_j would be (1/4)ħ^2 times the sum of the products of the Pauli matrices for each component. But I also recall that S_i·S_j can be expressed using the total spin operator S_total. Specifically, S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - S_i^2 - S_j^2)/2. That might be useful here because H is a sum of S_i·S_j terms.

So let me try to rewrite H using that identity. H becomes A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ] ). Let me compute each term:

First term: (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2
Second term: (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2
Third term: (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2

Adding these together:

[ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2) + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2) + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2) ] / 2

Let me compute the numerator:

3*S_total^2 - 2*S1^2 - 2*S2^2 - 2*S3^2

So the entire H becomes A*( [3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2 )

Simplify that:

H = (A/2)*(3*S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))

Now, since each S_i is a spin 1/2 particle, S_i^2 = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ^2 = (3/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

So substituting back:

H = (A/2)*(3*S_total^2 - 2*(9/4)ħ^2)
= (A/2)*(3*S_total^2 - (9/2)ħ^2)
= (3A/2)*S_total^2 - (9A/4)ħ^2

So H can be written as H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4)ħ^2.

Now, I need to compute the expectation value of H, which is <psi|H|psi>. Since H is expressed in terms of S_total^2, maybe I can find the eigenvalue of S_total^2 for the given state psi.

First, let me recall that the total spin S_total^2 is the sum of S1, S2, S3 squared, but in terms of individual spins, but we already used that. Alternatively, the eigenvalues of S_total^2 are s(s+1)ħ^2 where s is the total spin. So perhaps if I can find the total spin s of the state psi, I can find the eigenvalue.

So what is the spin state of psi? Let me write it out:

psi = 1/sqrt(3) [ |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ ]

This is a symmetric state under permutations of the spins. Let's think about the possible total spin multiplets for three spin 1/2 particles. The possible total spins s can be 1/2, 3/2. Since we have three spin 1/2 particles, the overall spin can combine in different ways.

We can have states with s=3/2 or s=1/2.

I need to find the total spin of psi. Let me consider the possible ways to combine spins.

First, for three spin 1/2 particles:

The possible total spins are:

- All three spin up: total spin 3/2.

- Two spin up and one spin down: total spin could be 1/2 or 3/2 depending on how they combine.

But in our case, psi is a symmetric state with two up and one down spins, but each term is a permutation.

Wait, let's consider that each term in psi has two spin-ups and one spin-down. So the state is symmetric under permutation of the particles, and has two up and one down.

So we can think of this state as part of the s=1/2 multiplet or s=3/2 multiplet.

Wait, for three spins, when you have two spin 1/2's and one spin 1/2, the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2. To figure out which one, perhaps we need to look at the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or think about the expectation value of S_total^2.

But maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_total^2 in the state psi.

But wait, another approach is to realize that the given state is symmetric and has two spin-ups and one spin-down. Let me think about the singlet and triplet states.

Wait, for two spin 1/2 particles, the singlet is S=0, and the triplet is S=1.

But for three spin 1/2 particles, it's a bit more complicated, but perhaps we can think of the state as a combination of states with different total spins.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_total^2 directly. Let me recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

Wait, but that's actually the reverse of how the Hamiltonian is given. H is proportional to the sum of S_i·S_j, so H is related to S_total^2.

Indeed, since H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4)ħ^2, then the expectation value of H would be (3A/2) <S_total^2> - (9A/4)ħ^2.

Therefore, if I can compute <S_total^2> for the state psi, I can find the expectation value of H.

So let's compute <S_total^2> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

Expanding S_total^2, we get:

S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Therefore, <S_total^2> = <S1^2> + <S2^2> + <S3^2> + 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>)

We already know that each <S_i^2> is (3/4)ħ^2, so that sum is 3*(3/4)ħ^2 = (9/4)ħ^2.

So now, the remaining term is 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>).

So let me compute each <S_i·S_j> for i ≠ j.

Recall that S_i·S_j = (1/2)(S_i^2 + S_j^2 - S_total^2_{i,j}), but that might not be helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express S_i·S_j in terms of spin operators and compute the expectation value.

But let me recall that for two spin 1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j can be related to their spin correlation. For the singlet state, the expectation value is - (3/4)ħ^2, and for the triplet state, it's (1/4)ħ^2.

Wait, let me verify that:

For two spin 1/2 particles, S·S = (S1·S2) = (1/2)(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)

So S1·S2 = (1/2)(S_total^2 - 3/4 ħ^2 - 3/4 ħ^2) = (1/2)(S_total^2 - 3/2 ħ^2)

So the expectation value <S1·S2> = (1/2)( <S_total^2> - 3/2 ħ^2 )

So if the state is a singlet, with S_total = 0, then <S1·S2> = (1/2)(0 - 3/2 ħ^2) = (-3/4) ħ^2.

If the state is a triplet, with S_total = 1, then <S1·S2> = (1/2)(2 - 3/2) ħ^2 = (1/2)(1/2)ħ^2 = 1/4 ħ^2.

But in our case, the state psi is a combination of three different states where each has two spins up and one spin down. So perhaps we can think about the state psi as a symmetric state with two spin-ups and one spin-down.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to note that the state psi is symmetric and has two spins up and one spin down, so it's similar to a triplet state in a way, but for three particles.

Alternatively, let's think about the total spin of the state. Since each term in psi has two spin-ups and one spin-down, perhaps the total spin is 1/2 or 3/2.

But to figure that out, maybe we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j for each pair.

Wait, let's compute <S1·S2> for the state psi.

Since S_i·S_j = (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z)

So let's compute each component.

First, express the state psi in terms of spin-up and spin-down.

psi = 1/sqrt(3)*( |↑↑↓⟩ + |↑↓↑⟩ + |↓↑↑⟩ )

So let's compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>

Since S1 and S2 are spin operators for particles 1 and 2, let's see how they act on psi.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think of it in terms of the computational basis.

But let me recall that for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 can be related to the sum of their spins.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 separately and then sum them up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expectation value of the dot product for each pair.

So let's first compute <S1·S2>:

Since S1·S2 = (S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z)

So we can compute each term separately.

Let me denote |↑⟩ as spin-up and |↓⟩ as spin-down.

So state |↑↑↓⟩ is |1↑, 2↑, 3↓⟩.

Similarly for the others.

So to compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>, that would be the expectation value of S1^z S2^z.

But since S1^z and S2^z are diagonal in the computational basis, their expectation values can be computed by looking at the states where the corresponding spins are up or down.

Similarly for S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y.

But wait, S1^x and S2^x are not diagonal, so calculating < S1^x S2^x > might be more involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the matrix elements.

But perhaps a smarter approach is to note that S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2)/2

But since S1 and S2 are spin 1/2, S1^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, similarly for S2^2.

So, S1·S2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4 + 3/4)/2 ħ^2 = (1/2)(S1 + S2)^2 - (3/4)ħ^2

Therefore, <S1·S2> = (1/2) <(S1 + S2)^2> - (3/4)ħ^2

But (S1 + S2)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + 2 S1·S2, so that seems circular.

Alternatively, maybe I should just compute < S_i·S_j > for each pair.

Let me focus on <S1·S2>.

Since the state psi is symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2, the expectation value of S1·S2 should be equal to that of S2·S3 and S1·S3.

Wait, is that true? Actually, the state psi is symmetric under permutation of all three particles, so the expectation values of S1·S2, S1·S3, and S2·S3 should all be equal.

Therefore, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = same value.

Therefore, I can compute one of them and it would be the same as the others.

So let's compute <S1·S2> = <psi| S1·S2 |psi>

Expressed in terms of the computational basis, let's consider the possible terms.

The state psi has three components: |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩.

Let me write out |↑↑↓⟩ as a tensor product: |1↑⟩⊗|2↑⟩⊗|3↓⟩.

Similarly, the others.

Now, S1·S2 acts on the first two qubits, so it can be written as S1^x S2^x + S1^y S2^y + S1^z S2^z.

So let's compute the expectation value for each term.

First, let's compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi>.

This is the expectation value of S1^z S2^z.

In the basis states, S1^z |↑⟩ = (1/2)ħ |↑⟩, similarly for S2^z.

So S1^z S2^z acts on a state |a⟩⊗|b⟩⊗|c⟩ as (S1^z a)⊗(S2^z b)⊗|c⟩.

So for each basis state in psi, let's compute S1^z S2^z |a⟩⊗|b⟩⊗|c⟩.

Take the first term: |↑↑↓⟩.

Applying S1^z S2^z to |↑↑↓⟩ gives (1/2 ħ |↑⟩)⊗(1/2 ħ |↑⟩)⊗|↓⟩ = (1/4 ħ^2) |↑↑↓⟩.

Similarly, the second term |↑↓↑⟩: S1^z S2^z gives (1/2 ħ |↑⟩)⊗(-1/2 ħ |↓⟩)⊗|↑⟩ = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩.

Third term |↓↑↑⟩: S1^z S2^z gives (-1/2 ħ |↓⟩)⊗(1/2 ħ |↑⟩)⊗|↑⟩ = (-1/4) ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩.

Therefore, S1^z S2^z |psi⟩ = (1/sqrt(3)) [ (1/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ ) + (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩ + (-1/4) ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Now, compute <psi| S1^z S2^z |psi⟩:

= (1/sqrt(3)) [ <↑↑↓| + <↑↓↑| + <↓↑↑| ] * (1/sqrt(3)) [ (1/4 ħ^2 |↑↑↓⟩ ) + (-1/4) ħ^2 |↑↓↑⟩ + (-1/4) ħ^2 |↓↑↑⟩ ]

Since the states |↑↑↓⟩, |↑↓↑⟩, |↓↑↑⟩ are orthogonal, the cross terms will vanish, and we get:

= (1/3) [ (1/4 ħ^2)^2 + (-1/4 ħ^2)^2 + (-1/4 ħ^2)^2 ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, it's:

= (1/3) [ (1/4 ħ^2)(1/4 ħ^2) + (-1/4 ħ^2)(-1/4 ħ^2) + (-1/4 ħ^2)(-1/4 ħ^2) ]

Wait, hold on, actually:

Wait, more accurately:

<psi| S1^z S2^z |psi> = (1/3) [ (1/4 ħ^2)^2 + ( -1/4 ħ^2 )^2 + ( -1/4 ħ^2 )^2 ]

Wait, no, that's incorrect because |psi> is a sum of three orthogonal states. So it's:

= (1/3) [ (1/4 ħ^2)(1/4 ħ^2) + ( -1/4 ħ^2)( -1/4 ħ^2 ) + ( -1/4 ħ^2)( -1/4 ħ^2 ) ]

Wait, but that would imply the same as:

= (1/3) * ( (1/4)^2 + (1/4)^2 + (1/4)^2 ) ħ^4

But that can't be because S1^z S2^z acting on |↑↑↓⟩ gives a positive term, and on the others gives negative terms. So when we take the inner product, we have:

= (1/3) [ (1/4 ħ^2)(1/4 ħ^2) + ( -1/4 ħ^2)(-1/4 ħ^2) + ( -1/4 ħ^2)(-1/4 ħ^2) ]

Wait, that's not quite right because the coefficients are 1, -1, -1 respectively in the S1^z S2^z |psi⟩, so when taking the inner product, it's 1*(1/4 ħ^2) + (-1)*( -1/4 ħ^2 ) + (-1)*( -1/4 ħ^2 )

So that's 1/4 ħ^2 + 1/4 ħ^2 + 1/4 ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

Then multiply by 1/3 because of the normalization:

So <S1^z S2^z> = (1/3)(3/4 ħ^2) = 1/4 ħ^2.

Similarly, the expectation value of S1^z S2^z is 1/4 ħ^2.

Now, we need to compute the expectation values of S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y.

This might be trickier because S1^x and S2^x don't commute with the states.

I recall that S^x = (S^+ + S^-)/2 and S^y = (S^+ - S^-)/(2i), where S^+ and S^- are the spin raising and lowering operators.

So perhaps I can express S1^x S2^x and S1^y S2^y in terms of S^+ and S^- for each spin.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for the singlet state, the expectation value of S1·S2 is -3/4 ħ^2, and for the triplet state, it's 1/4 ħ^2.

Wait, but our state is a combination of states with two spin-ups and one spin-down, so maybe it's a member of a multiplet where the total spin is 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, let's think about the possible total spin.

If the state has two spin-ups and one spin-down, the total spin can be either 1/2 or 3/2.

To figure this out, perhaps we can compute the expectation value of S_total^2.

If the state is in a spin 1/2 multiplet, then <S_total^2> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ħ^2 = 3/4 ħ^2.

If it's in a spin 3/2 multiplet, then <S_total^2> = (3/2)(3/2 + 1) ħ^2 = (15/4) ħ^2.

But how do we figure out which one it is?

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to note that the state psi is symmetric under permutation of the spins. So, perhaps it's part of the symmetric subspace.

Wait, in three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace under permutation has dimension 3 (since the total dimension is 8, and the symmetric subspace has dimension 4 for even permutations and another for odd, but perhaps I should recall the exact decomposition).

Wait, more accurately, the spin states for three spin 1/2 particles can be decomposed into irreducible representations. The symmetric subspace includes states which are unchanged under permutation. The symmetric subspace has dimension 4 because it includes the triplet states (s=3/2) and the singlet state (s=1/2), but actually, that may not be correct.

Wait, actually, the symmetric subspace includes all states that are symmetric under permutation, which would include the symmetric states of the triplet (which is fully symmetric) and the symmetric states of the singlet, but the singlet is actually anti-symmetric. Wait, no, the singlet is anti-symmetric.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the spin states transform under the permutation group.

Alternatively, maybe it's too time-consuming, so perhaps I can compute the expectation value of S_total^2 directly.

Given that, let me compute <S_total^2> = <psi| (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 |psi>

Expanding S_total^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

So as before, <S_total^2> = 3*(3/4)ħ^2 + 2*(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3>)

We already found <S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2

Similarly, since the state is symmetric, <S1·S2> = <S1·S3> = <S2·S3> = 1/4 ħ^2

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2*(3*(1/4) ħ^2 ) = 9/4 ħ^2 + (6/4) ħ^2 = (15/4) ħ^2

Wait, 9/4 + 6/4 is 15/4, so <S_total^2> = 15/4 ħ^2

But wait, if the state has a total spin s, then <S_total^2> would be s(s+1) ħ^2.

So s(s+1) ħ^2 = 15/4 ħ^2 => s(s+1) = 15/4 => s^2 + s - 15/4 = 0

Solving, s = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 15) ] / 2 = [ -1 ± 4 ] / 2

So s = (3/2) or s = (-5/2). Since spin can't be negative, s = 3/2.

Therefore, the state psi is in the spin 3/2 multiplet.

Thus, the expectation value of S_total^2 is (3/2)(5/2) ħ^2 = 15/4 ħ^2, which matches our previous result.

So now, going back to the Hamiltonian:

H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

We have <H> = (3A/2) <S_total^2> - (9A/4) ħ^2

Substituting <S_total^2> = 15/4 ħ^2:

< H > = (3A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) - (9A/4) ħ^2
= (45A/8) ħ^2 - (18A/8) ħ^2
= (27A/8) ħ^2

Wait, that can't be right because the user said the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S_total^2>.

Wait, let's double-check.

Earlier, I computed <S_total^2> as 15/4 ħ^2, but if the state is in the s=3/2 multiplet, then S_total^2 should be (3/2)(5/2) ħ^2 = 15/4 ħ^2, which is correct.

However, let's check the Hamiltonian expression again.

H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We rewrote this as:

H = (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

But let me verify this:

Starting from H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Express each term as (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2, etc.

So S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2

Similarly for S1·S3 and S2·S3.

Therefore, H = A*( [ (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S3^2)/2 + (S_total^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2 ] )

Which simplifies to:

H = A*( [ 3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 2*(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2

Since S1^2 = S2^2 = S3^2 = 3/4 ħ^2 each, sum is 9/4 ħ^2

Thus, H = A*(3 S_total^2 - 2*(9/4) ħ^2)/2
= A/2*(3 S_total^2 - 9/2 ħ^2)
= (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

So that part is correct.

Then <H> = (3A/2) <S_total^2> - (9A/4) ħ^2

We found <S_total^2> = 15/4 ħ^2

Thus, <H> = (3A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) - (9A/4) ħ^2
= (45A/8) ħ^2 - (18A/8) ħ^2
= (27A/8) ħ^2 ≈ 3.375 A ħ^2

But the user said the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ^2. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of <S_total^2>. Let me recalculate that.

Earlier, I thought that <S_total^2> is 15/4 ħ^2 because the state is in the s=3/2 multiplet, which is correct if the state has total spin 3/2.

But wait, perhaps the state psi is not in the s=3/2 multiplet. Maybe the state is in s=1/2.

Wait, how can that be? Because the state has two spin-ups and one spin-down, which is a symmetric state.

Wait, but the triplet state for three particles is s=1/2? No, triplet for two particles is s=1, but for three particles, the possible spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, another approach: the state psi is a symmetric combination of two spin-ups and one spin-down. Such a state can be part of the spin 1/2 or 3/2 multiplet.

Wait, let's consider that for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace has dimension 4, which includes the spin 3/2 (triplet) and the spin 1/2 (singlet). Wait, no, actually, for three spin 1/2 particles, the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, consisting of the triplet (which is symmetric) and the singlet (which is anti-symmetric, actually). Wait, no, the singlet is anti-symmetric. So symmetric subspace includes the triplet (which has 3 states) and perhaps another symmetric state.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall that for three spins, the decomposition is:

symmetric subspace: s=3/2 (triplet) + s=1/2 (singlet)
antisymmetric subspace: s=1/2 (another set)

Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall that for three spin 1/2 particles, the spin states can be decomposed into:

- s=3/2: 4 states (triplet)
- s=1/2: 3 states (singlet)

Wait, no, that doesn't add up because the total number of spin states is 8.

Wait, actually, the correct decomposition is:

The symmetric subspace under permutation has 4 states: these are the triplet states (s=1/2) and the singlet state (s=1/2 as well, but actually, the singlet is anti-symmetric). Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the spin states for three particles can be decomposed into:

- Spin 3/2: 4 states
- Spin 1/2: 4 states

But perhaps the spin 1/2 states are a combination of symmetric and anti-symmetric states.

Wait, I think I need to look it up or think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the state psi is in the spin 1/2 multiplet.

Wait, but how can I see that?

Wait, the state psi has S_total^2 = 15/4 ħ^2, which implies s=3/2.

Therefore, it's in the spin 3/2 multiplet.

But then, the expectation value of H would be (27A/8) ħ^2, which doesn't match the user's answer.

So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing <S_total^2>.

Let me re-examine the computation of <S_total^2>.

We had H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

We know that S1·S2 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2)/2

Similarly for others.

Therefore, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = [3 S_total^2 - 2(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)] / 2

Therefore, H = A*( [3 S_total^2 - 2*(3*(3/4) ħ^2)] / 2 )

= A*( [3 S_total^2 - (9/2) ħ^2 ] / 2 )

= (3A/2) S_total^2 - (9A/4) ħ^2

Which is correct.

Then, the expectation value is:

< H > = (3A/2) <S_total^2> - (9A/4) ħ^2

We thought <S_total^2> = 15/4 ħ^2, so:

= (3A/2)(15/4 ħ^2) - (9A/4) ħ^2
= (45A/8) ħ^2 - (18A/8) ħ^2
= (27A/8) ħ^2

But the user says the expectation value is 3/4 A ħ^2.

So unless I made a mistake, perhaps the state is not in the spin 3/2 multiplet. Maybe I computed <S_total^2> incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the state psi is in the spin 1/2 multiplet. Let me think again.

Wait, the state psi is symmetric under permutation, so it could be in the symmetric part of the spin 1/2 representation, which is 3-dimensional.

Wait, but the dimension of spin 1/2 is 2, so symmetric part would be 1 state?

Wait, no, the symmetric subspace for spin 1/2 is 1 state, and the antisymmetric is another state.

But for three particles, the symmetric subspace is 4-dimensional, which includes s=3/2 and s=1/2 symmetric states.

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <S_total^2> directly by expanding S_total^2.

So, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)

Thus, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ħ^2 + 2(<S1·S2> + <S1·S3> + <S2·S3> )

Earlier, I computed <S1·S2> = 1/4 ħ^2, and since it's symmetric, <S1·S3> and <S2·S3> are the same, so:

< S_total^2 > = 9/4 + 2*(3*(1/4)) = 9/4 + 6/4 = 15/4

So that part is correct.

But then, if the state is in s=3/2, then the expectation value of H is 27A/8 ħ^2.

But the user says the
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles, and I'm given a specific Hamiltonian and a spin state. The question is whether the spin state is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, and if it's not, what the expectation value of the energy is. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the given information:

- The Hamiltonian is H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃), where A is a constant.
- The spin state ψ is given as ψ = (1/√3)*(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃).
- The task is to determine if ψ is an eigenfunction of H and, if not, find the expectation value of E.

Okay, so the first thing I need to do is understand the structure of the Hamiltonian and the state ψ.

The Hamiltonian is a sum of dot products of the spin operators. Each term like S₁·S₂ is the scalar (dot) product of the spin operators for particles 1 and 2. Since each S_i is a spin-1/2 operator, the dot product will involve the sum of their individual components. So, S₁·S₂ = (S₁x S₂x + S₁y S₂y + S₁z S₂z).

The state ψ is a symmetric combination of three terms, each of which has two spins up and one spin down. Specifically, each term is a product state where two spins are up, and one is down. The coefficients are all 1/√3, so it's an equally weighted combination of the three possible configurations.

I remember that for spin systems, eigenstates can often be symmetric or anti-symmetric states, especially when dealing with total spin or exchange operators. For two particles, the singlet and triplet states are eigenstates of the total spin squared operator, S_total². Maybe something similar can be applied here for three particles.

But here, the Hamiltonian isn't just the total spin squared; it's a sum of pairwise dot products. Let me think about that. The operator S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ can be rewritten in terms of the total spin squared. I recall that S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ = (S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2. Is that right?

Wait, let me check: S_total = S₁ + S₂ + S₃, so S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). So solving for the sum of pairwise dot products: S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ = (S_total² - S₁² - S₂² - S₃²)/2.

Yes, that seems correct. So H can be written as A*(S_total² - S1² - S2² - S3²)/2.

Now, for spin 1/2 particles, each S_i² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². So S1² = S2² = S3² = (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, H = A*(S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2 = A*(S_total² - (9/4)ħ²)/2.

So H is proportional to S_total². Therefore, the eigenstates of H are the same as the eigenstates of S_total², which are the states with definite total spin S.

In this case, since the particles are all spin 1/2, the total spin can be S = 3/2 or S = 1/2. The state ψ is a symmetric combination, so it's likely to be in the symmetric subspace, which for three spin 1/2 particles can have total spin S = 3/2 or maybe split into other states.

Wait, for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are indeed 3/2 and 1/2. The state ψ is symmetric under exchange of any two particles, right? Because swapping any two particles in ψ gives another term in the sum, so the state is symmetric. Therefore, it must lie in the subspace with total spin S = 3/2.

But wait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the possible total spin states for three spin 1/2 particles: the symmetric states can have total spin S = 3/2 or S = 1/2, but the S = 1/2 symmetric states are actually mixed in with the S = 1/2 antisymmetric states? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps to determine the eigenvalues, I can compute the action of S_total² on the state ψ.

Since ψ is symmetric, let's see if S_total² acting on ψ gives an eigenvalue.

But before that, maybe I should compute S_total² for the given state.

Wait, S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)² = S1² + S2² + S3² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). Since we have H expressed in terms of S_total², knowing S_total² will help us find H.

But to find the eigenvalue of S_total² on ψ, perhaps we can compute ⟨ψ|S_total²|ψ⟩. But if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total², then the expectation value will be equal to the eigenvalue. So maybe we can compute this expectation value and see if it matches an eigenvalue, or if it's not an eigenstate, just a regular state with a certain expectation value.

Alternatively, we can note that the given state ψ is a singlet state for three particles? Or not exactly. Wait, in two particles, the singlet state was antisymmetric, but for three particles, the singlet concept is different. Wait, no, for three particles, the singlet state would have total spin S = 0, which is antisymmetric, but our state ψ is symmetric, so it's in the higher spin multiplet.

Wait, maybe it's in the triplet state? But triplet usually refers to two particles. For three particles, the possible total spin states are S = 3/2 and S = 1/2. The S=1/2 states are actually a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric states? Maybe that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, let me try to calculate the expectation value of S_total² on ψ.

But first, I need to compute ⟨ψ|S_total²|ψ⟩. Let's write that out.

Since S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)², expanding this gives Σ S_i² + 2 Σ S_i·S_j.

So ⟨ψ|S_total²|ψ⟩ = ⟨ψ|(Σ S_i²)|ψ⟩ + 2⟨ψ|(Σ S_i·S_j)|ψ⟩.

We already know that each S_i² = (3/4)ħ², so the first term is (3/4)ħ² * 3 = (9/4)ħ².

The second term is 2 times the sum over all i<j of ⟨ψ|S_i·S_j|ψ⟩. Since the Hamiltonian includes the sum S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃, which is only three terms, but the total sum would have six terms for three particles. But in our case, the Hamiltonian only includes three of them.

Wait, but in S_total², we have all the pairwise terms, not just the three. So perhaps for our specific Hamiltonian, we have H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃), so it's not the same as S_total², which includes all six pairwise terms. Hmm. That complicates things.

Wait, but earlier I had H = A*(S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2.

But let me double-check that.

Wait, S_total² = (S₁ + S₂ + S₃)² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + 2(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). Therefore, S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ = (S_total² - S₁² - S₂² - S₃²)/2. So then H = A*(S_total² - 3*(3/4)ħ²)/2.

So H is proportional to S_total². Therefore, if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² on ψ, I can find the eigenvalue of H.

So, going back, ⟨ψ|S_total²|ψ⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*⟨ψ| (sum_{i<j} S_i·S_j) |ψ⟩.

But wait, the sum over i<j S_i·S_j is actually six terms: S₁·S₂, S₁·S₃, S₂·S₃, S₁·S₄, etc., but in our case, we have three particles, so only three distinct pairs: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. So the sum over i<j S_i·S_j for three particles is exactly the sum S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃. Therefore, the second term in ⟨S_total²⟩ is 2 times the expectation value of H/A multiplied by A, but wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, let me try again.

H = A*(S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃). So the sum S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃ is H/A.

So, in the expression for ⟨S_total²⟩, we have:

⟨S_total²⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(⟨S₁·S₂⟩ + ⟨S₁·S₃⟩ + ⟨S₂·S₃⟩).

But H/A = ⟨S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃⟩? Wait, not necessarily, because H is A times that sum, so ⟨H⟩ = A*(⟨S₁·S₂⟩ + ⟨S₁·S₃⟩ + ⟨S₂·S₃⟩).

So, ⟨S₁·S₂ + S₁·S₃ + S₂·S₃⟩ = ⟨H⟩/A.

Therefore, ⟨S_total²⟩ = (9/4)ħ² + 2*(⟨H⟩/A).

But S_total² is also equal to (something related to the total spin S). Let me see, for a system of three spin 1/2 particles, the eigenvalue of S_total² is S(S+1)ħ², where S can be 3/2 or 1/2.

So if I can find the eigenvalue of S_total² on ψ, then I can find ⟨H⟩.

But I don't know if ψ is an eigenstate of S_total². If ψ is an eigenstate, then ⟨S_total²⟩ is equal to the eigenvalue, which would be either (3/2)(3/2 +1)ħ² = (15/4)ħ² or (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².

But if ψ is not an eigenstate, then ⟨S_total²⟩ is not equal to those eigenvalues, but instead is the expectation value from the mixed state.

So perhaps I can compute ⟨S_total²⟩ directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the individual expectation values ⟨S₁·S₂⟩, ⟨S₁·S₃⟩, ⟨S₂·S₃⟩.

Since the state ψ is symmetric, all three of these expectation values should be equal. Because swapping particles 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc., should leave the state invariant.

Therefore, ⟨S₁·S₂⟩ = ⟨S₁·S₃⟩ = ⟨S₂·S₃⟩. Let's denote each of these as ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = x.

Therefore, H = A*(3x) = 3A x.

So, the expectation value of H is 3A x. Therefore, to find the expectation value of H, I need to compute x = ⟨S₁·S₂⟩.

But ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ can be written as (1/4)⟨(σ_i · σ_j)⟩, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, is that right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/4)σ_i·σ_j.

Yes, correct. So ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/4)⟨σ_i · σ_j⟩.

So, if I can compute ⟨σ_i · σ_j⟩ for the state ψ, then I can find x, and hence ⟨H⟩.

So, let's compute ⟨σ_i · σ_j⟩ for each pair (i,j).

First, for particles 1 and 2, σ₁·σ₂.

But since the state ψ is a symmetric combination, perhaps I can write ψ as a combination of product states and compute the expectation value in that basis.

Alternatively, I can note that in the computational basis, each term in ψ is a product of up or down spins for each particle.

So, ψ is (1/√3)(↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃).

Let me compute the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ₁·σ₂|ψ⟩.

First, note that σ₁·σ₂ = σ₁x σ₂x + σ₁y σ₂y + σ₁z σ₂z.

So, we can write the expectation value as ⟨ψ|σ₁x σ₂x |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|σ₁y σ₂y |ψ⟩ + ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩.

Let me compute each term separately.

First, compute ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩.

σ₁z σ₂z is diagonal in the computational basis, so it acts on each particle by multiplying by its z-component spin. Therefore, σ₁z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ₁z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩, similarly for σ₂z.

Therefore, σ₁z σ₂z acts on the tensor product states as follows:

σ₁z σ₂z |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ = (1)(1)|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩,
σ₁z σ₂z |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ = (1)(-1)|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩,
σ₁z σ₂z |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ = (-1)(1)|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩.

Therefore, σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)[σ₁z σ₂z |↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + σ₁z σ₂z |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + σ₁z σ₂z |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩]
= (1/√3)[|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ - |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩].

Then, ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ with this result.

So, ψ = (1/√3)(|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ + |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩).

Therefore, the inner product becomes:

(1/√3)(⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃| + ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃| + ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|) * (1/√3)(|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ - |↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + |↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩).

Multiplying these out:

(1/3)[⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ - ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩
+ ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ - ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩
+ ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ - ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ + ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩].

Now, let's compute each term:

1. ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩ = 1.
2. -⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩: The first two particles are up, but the third is down in the first state, and up in the second. So they are orthogonal, so this term is 0.
3. ⟨↑₁↑₂↓₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩: The first particle is up vs down, others match. So inner product is 0.
4. ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩: The first particle matches, the second is down vs up, third is up vs down. So inner product is 0.
5. -⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩ = -1.
6. ⟨↑₁↓₂↑₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩: First particle down vs up, others match. So inner product is 0.
7. ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↑₁↑₂↓₃⟩: First particle down vs up, others match. So inner product is 0.
8. -⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↑₁↓₂↑₃⟩: First particle down vs up, third particle up vs down. So inner product is 0.
9. ⟨↓₁↑₂↑₃|↓₁↑₂↑₃⟩ = 1.

So adding up all these terms:

1 (from term 1) - 0 + 0 + 0 -1 (from term 5) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 +1 (from term 9) = 1 -1 +1 =1.

Therefore, ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩ = (1/3)(1) = 1/3.

But wait, hold on. Each term in the expansion was multiplied by 1/3, but the result was 1, so ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ = 1/3.

Wait, but this is in terms of the computational basis, so I think the expectation value is 1/3, but we need to be careful about the units. Wait, since σ_i are dimensionless Pauli matrices, their expectation values are dimensionless, and S_i·S_j has units of ħ², because S_i has units of ħ. Since S_i = (1/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (1/4)σ_i·σ_j. Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/4)⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩, so ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ has units of ħ².

So, if ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = 1/3, then ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (1/4)(1/3)ħ² = (1/12)ħ².

Wait, hold on, maybe not. Let's think carefully.

Wait, actually, for spin-1/2 particles, S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (ħ²/4)σ_i·σ_j. Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ħ²/4)⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩.

Therefore, if ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = 1/3, then ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ħ²/4)*(1/3) = ħ²/12.

But wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let me clarify:

Each S_i has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Therefore, ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ can be written as (1/4)⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩, because S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i.

Therefore, if ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ is computed in dimensionless units, then ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ would be (1/4) times that. So if ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ is 1/3, then ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ is (1/4)*(1/3)ħ² = ħ²/12.

But perhaps I should think in terms of actual eigenvalues.

Wait, when computing ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩, I got 1/3. Therefore, ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ = 1/3.

But σ₁z and σ₂z are diagonal, so their expectation value is just the sum over the probabilities of having the same spin in the z-direction.

Wait, let me think about that.

In our state ψ, which is (↑₁↑₂↓₃ + ↑₁↓₂↑₃ + ↓₁↑₂↑₃)/√3, for each term:

- In the first term, σ₁z = +1, σ₂z = +1.
- Second term: σ₁z = +1, σ₂z = -1.
- Third term: σ₁z = -1, σ₂z = +1.

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ is the average of (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(1), divided by 3.

So that's (1 -1 -1)/3 = (-1)/3. Wait, that contradicts what I calculated earlier.

Wait, no, because when you take the inner product, you have to project onto the same state. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that.

Wait, wait, no, that's not the right way to compute ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩. Let me think again.

When I calculated ⟨ψ|σ₁z σ₂z |ψ⟩, I got 1/3. But from the state ψ, each term has different σ₁z and σ₂z.

Wait, but when I applied σ₁z σ₂z, I got the same state when it's |↑↑⟩ and |↓↑⟩ etc. But when I did the inner product, I ended up with 1/3, so that must be correct.

Wait, but let's compute ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ another way.

The expectation value ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ is the expectation value of the product of spins in the z-direction. So it's the probability that σ₁z and σ₂z are both +1, plus the probability that they are both -1. Because σz is +1 for spin up and -1 for spin down.

Looking at ψ, let's compute the probability that both σ₁z and σ₂z are +1: that corresponds to the terms where both 1 and 2 are up. In ψ, the first term is |↑↑↓⟩, which has both 1 and 2 up. The second term is |↑↓↑⟩, which has 1 up, 2 down. The third term is |↓↑↑⟩, which has 1 down, 2 up.

So the only term where both 1 and 2 are up is the first term. So the probability is 1/3.

Similarly, the probability that both σ₁z and σ₂z are -1: that would be if both are down. But in ψ, none of the terms have both 1 and 2 down. So the probability is 0.

Therefore, ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ = (1/3)*1 + (0)*(-1) = 1/3.

So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, ⟨σ₁z σ₂z⟩ = 1/3.

Similarly, I can compute ⟨σ₁x σ₂x⟩ and ⟨σ₁y σ₂y⟩.

Wait, but σx and σy are tricky because they are not diagonal. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute their expectation values.

Alternatively, note that ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ can be expressed in terms of the spin state.

For two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet and triplet states have well-known properties. The singlet state has ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = -3, and the triplet states have ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = 1. Wait, is that right?

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the singlet state is (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, and the triplet states are (|↑↑⟩, (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2, and (|↓↓⟩).

So, for the singlet state, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = ⟨(σ_i·σ_j)⟩ = -3, because (σ_i·σ_j) = 3 for triplet, -1 for singlet? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me compute it.

For the singlet state, |singlet⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Then, (σ₁·σ₂)|singlet⟩ = (σ₁x σ₂x + σ₁y σ₂y + σ₁z σ₂z)|singlet⟩.

Compute each term:

σ₁x σ₂x |↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↑|) ⊗ (|↑⟩⟨↓|) |↑↓⟩ = (|↓⟩⟨↑|↑⟩) ⊗ (|↑⟩⟨↓|↓⟩) = |↓⟩⊗|↓⟩ = |↓↓⟩.

Similarly, σ₁x σ₂x |↓↑⟩ = (|↑⟩⟨↓|) ⊗ (|↓⟩⟨↑|) |↓↑⟩ = |↑↑⟩.

So σ₁x σ₂x |singlet⟩ = (|↓↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩)/√2.

Similarly, σ₁y σ₂y |↑↓⟩ = (i|↓⟩⟨↑|) ⊗ (i|↑⟩⟨↓|) |↑↓⟩ = (i|↓⟩⟨↑|↑⟩) ⊗ (i|↑⟩⟨↓|↓⟩) = i|↓⟩⊗i|↑⟩ = -|↓↑⟩.

Similarly, σ₁y σ₂y |↓↑⟩ = (i|↑⟩⟨↓|) ⊗ (i|↓⟩⟨↑|) |↓↑⟩ = i|↑⟩⊗i|↓⟩ = -|↑↓⟩.

Therefore, σ₁y σ₂y |singlet⟩ = (-|↓↑⟩ - |↑↓⟩)/√2 = -(|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Now, σ₁z σ₂z |↑↓⟩ = (-1)|↑↓⟩, and σ₁z σ₂z |↓↑⟩ = (+1)|↓↑⟩. So:

σ₁z σ₂z |singlet⟩ = (-|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 = (-|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Therefore, putting it all together:

(σ₁·σ₂)|singlet⟩ = (|↓↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩)/√2 - (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 + (-|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

Wait, that seems complicated. But we can compute ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ for the singlet state.

In the singlet state, (σ₁·σ₂) has eigenvalues. I think the expectation value of σ₁·σ₂ for the singlet state is -3. Because for two spins, the total spin S² = (σ₁ + σ₂)² = σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂. The eigenvalues are S(S+1) = 0(0+1) = 0. Therefore, 0 = (3/4 + 3/4) + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩. So 0 = 3/2 + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩. Therefore, ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = -3/4.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, confusion arises between S² and σ².

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S = (σ₁ + σ₂)/2. So S² = (σ₁ + σ₂)² /4 = σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂.

Since σ₁² = 3/4 ħ² for spin-1/2, so S² = (3/4 + 3/4)ħ² + 2σ₁·σ₂.

Therefore, S² = (3/2)ħ² + 2σ₁·σ₂.

For the singlet state, S² = 0, so 0 = (3/2)ħ² + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩.

Thus, 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = - (3/2)ħ², so ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = - (3/4)ħ².

Therefore, for the singlet state, ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = -3/4 (in units of ħ²). Wait, no, hold on: actually, S is in units of ħ, so S² is in units of ħ², and σ is dimensionless, so ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ is a number.

Wait, no, perhaps I need to clarify the units again.

Wait, S = (σ₁ + σ₂)/2, so S² is in units of ħ², and σ_i are dimensionless. Therefore, ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ is a number, as it's the expectation value of a dimensionless operator.

But when we write S² = (σ₁ + σ₂)² /4, that is, S² = (σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂)/4. So, in the singlet state, S² = 0, so 0 = (σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂)/4. Therefore, 0 = (3/4 + 3/4 + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩)/4. Wait, no, because S² is 0, so:

0 = [σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂]/4.

So, 0 = ( (3/4) + (3/4) + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ ) /4, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just directly compute the expectation value in the singlet state.

From earlier, I had:

(σ₁·σ₂)|singlet⟩ = (|↓↓⟩ - |↑↑⟩)/√2 - (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 + (-|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2.

But this seems messy. Alternatively, in the singlet state, the expectation value ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ is -3.

Wait, wait, I think I need to refer back to how the spin operators act on the singlet state.

Wait, in the singlet state, (σ₁ + σ₂)² |singlet⟩ = 0, because S² |singlet⟩ = 0.

Expanding that, (σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂) |singlet⟩ = 0.

Thus, (3/4 + 3/4) |singlet⟩ + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ |singlet⟩ = 0.

So, (3/2) |singlet⟩ + 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ |singlet⟩ = 0.

Therefore, 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ |singlet⟩ = -(3/2)|singlet⟩.

Therefore, ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = -(3/4) * (|singlet⟩ / |singlet⟩ ) = -3/4.

Wait, that can't be. Because 2⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = - (3/2), so ⟨σ₁·σ₂⟩ = -3/4.

Wait, but σ_i·σ_j for two spin-1/2 particles is known to have eigenvalues 3 and -1. So if the state is a triplet, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = 3, and if it's a singlet, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = -1.

Wait, that seems conflicting with what I just calculated. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, for two spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S = (σ₁ + σ₂)/2. So S² = (σ₁ + σ₂)² /4 = σ₁² + σ₂² + 2σ₁·σ₂.

Thus, S² = (3/4 + 3/4) + 2σ₁·σ₂ = (3/2) + 2σ₁·σ₂.

So, 2σ₁·σ₂ = S² - 3/2.

Thus, σ₁·σ₂ = (S² - 3/2)/2.

Therefore, for the singlet state, S² = 0, so σ₁·σ₂ = (0 - 3/2)/2 = -3/4.

Similarly, for the triplet state, S² = 2(2 + 1)ħ² = 6ħ²? Wait, no, S² for triplet is S(S+1)ħ², S=1, so 2ħ².

Wait, hold on, in our case, S is in units of ħ. So S² for the triplet is 1*(1+1) = 2, so S² = 2ħ².

Thus, σ₁·σ₂ = (S² - 3/2)/2 = (2*ħ² - 3/2)/2 = (2ħ² - 3/2)/2 = ħ² - 3/4.

Wait, but this is confusing because we're mixing units. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the expectation value.

Wait, for the triplet state, S² = 2ħ², so plug in:

σ₁·σ₂ = (S² - 3/2)/2 = (2ħ² - 3/2)/2 = (2ħ²)/2 - (3/2)/2 = ħ² - 3/4.

But the expectation value of σ₁·σ₂ in the triplet state would be ħ² - 3/4? That doesn't make sense because σ₁·σ₂ is unitless, but ħ² is not unitless. Maybe I need to factor in the units again.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units earlier. Let me clarify.

Each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, so they are dimensionless. However, for spin operators, S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i. So S_i has units of ħ.

Then, S_i·S_j = (ħ²/4)(σ_i·σ_j). Therefore, S_i·S_j has units of ħ².

Therefore, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_i·S_j is (ħ²/4)⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩.

In the singlet state, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = -1, so ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ħ²/4)(-1) = -ħ²/4.

In the triplet state, ⟨σ_i·σ_j⟩ = 3, so ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = (ħ²/4)(3) = 3ħ²/4.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for two spin-1/2 particles:

- Singlet state: ⟨S_i·S_j⟩ = -ħ²
[overthinking]
Alright, so I have this problem about three spin 1/2 particles. The Hamiltonian is given by H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), where A is a constant. The state provided is psi = (1/sqrt(3))*(|↑1↑2↓3> + |↑1↓2↑3> + |↓1↑2↑3>). The question is whether this state is an eigenstate of H, and if not, what's the expectation value of the energy E.

First, let me recall what spin operators do. Each Si is the spin operator for particle i, which has components S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z. The dot product S_i·S_j would then be S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z. So the Hamiltonian H is a sum of these dot products for each pair of particles.

Since it's about spin 1/2 particles, each spin operator has eigenvalues related to the Pauli matrices. For a spin 1/2 particle, S_i^z has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. The other components, S_i^x and S_i^y, involve the spin raising and lowering operators.

Now, the state psi is a symmetric combination of three terms, each with two spins up and one spin down. Let's analyze the state. It has a total spin of 1/2 each for the first two particles and then one down, but wait, no. Each term has two up spins and one down. So the total spin might be... Let me think. For each term, the total spin z-component is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ℏ = (1/2)ℏ. So the state has a total spin of 1/2. Therefore, it's a spin singlet? No, wait, spin singlet is for two particles. For three particles, the total spin can be 1/2, 3/2, etc. So this is a specific state with total spin 1/2. Hmm.

But how does this relate to the Hamiltonian? The Hamiltonian is a sum of pairwise spin interactions. Since H is symmetric under exchange of particles, the state psi is symmetric in the particles. So maybe it's an eigenstate of H. Or maybe not.

Wait, let me think about how H acts on the state psi. If psi is an eigenstate, then H acting on psi would just scale it by some eigenvalue. Otherwise, the expectation value would involve some sum of expectation values for each term.

Alternatively, maybe we can express the spin dot products in terms of total spin operators. Let me recall that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. Expanding that gives S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3). So that means S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 = (S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2.

So, H = A*(S_total^2 - S1^2 - S2^2 - S3^2)/2. So H is proportional to (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2). Therefore, if we can compute the eigenvalues of S_total^2 and S_i^2 for the state psi, we can find the expectation value of H.

For spin 1/2 particles, each S_i^2 has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ^2 = (3/4)ℏ^2. So sum S_i^2 = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 = 9/4 ℏ^2.

Now, what is S_total^2 for the state psi? Since the state has total spin S = 1/2, the eigenvalue of S_total^2 is S(S+1)ℏ^2 = (1/2)(3/2)ℏ^2 = (3/4)ℏ^2.

So, plugging back into H, we have H = A*( (3/4 ℏ^2) - 9/4 ℏ^2 ) / 2 = A*( -6/4 ℏ^2 ) / 2 = A*(-6/8)ℏ^2 = A*(-3/4)ℏ^2.

Wait, but that suggests the energy is negative. However, perhaps I made a mistake here because the expectation value is a positive quantity. Alternatively, maybe the state has a different total spin. Wait, let's check.

Wait, the state is symmetric, but what is its total spin? Each term in psi has two ups and one down. So the total spin z-component is (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2)ℏ = (1/2)ℏ. So yes, the total spin S^z is 1/2 ℏ.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that the total spin S is 1/2. Because for three particles, the total spin can be 1/2 or 3/2. However, to have S^z = 1/2, the total spin could be S=1/2 or S=3/2. The possible total spin states for three spin-1/2 particles are S=3/2, 1/2.

Wait, actually, the symmetric states can have different total spins. So perhaps the state psi is a combination of different S states.

Wait, but wait, the state psi is given as a combination of three specific terms, each with two up and one down. Let me check whether this is a singlet state or not. For two particles, a singlet state is antisymmetric. But for three particles, a singlet state would have total spin 1/2 and be symmetric under permutation. Hmm, actually, I think for three particles, the spin 1/2 state can be symmetric or antisymmetric?

Wait, no. The spin state for three particles can have total spin S=1/2, 3/2, etc., depending on the configuration. But in this case, the state is symmetric under permutation of particles because swapping particles doesn't change the state (since each term has two ups and one down, swapping any two particles would still give one of the terms in the sum).

So the state is symmetric. So the total spin S can be either 1/2 or 3/2.

Wait, how do we determine whether S=1/2 or 3/2? Let's try to compute the expectation value of S_total^2. If it's (1/2)(1/2 +1)ℏ^2 = 3/4 ℏ^2, then S=1/2. Otherwise, if it's 3/2*(3/2 +1)ℏ^2 = 15/4 ℏ^2, then S=3/2.

So let's compute the expectation value of S_total^2 for the state psi.

The state psi is a symmetric combination of three states, each with two up spins and one down. Let's denote each term as |↑↑↓>, |↑↓↑>, and |↓↑↑>.

To compute <psi|S_total^2|psi>, we can note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already know that S_i^2 for each spin 1/2 particle is 3/4 ℏ^2, so sum S_i^2 = 9/4 ℏ^2. The term S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 is exactly the Hamiltonian part, but since H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3), we can write H = A*(sum S_i·S_j) where the sum is over i<j.

Wait, but in terms of expectation value, the expectation value of H is A times the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j. But perhaps we can compute the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j separately.

Alternatively, since S_total^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j, so sum S_i·S_j = (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2)/2.

Therefore, the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j is ( <S_total^2> - sum <S_i^2> ) / 2.

As we said before, each <S_i^2> is 3/4 ℏ^2, so sum <S_i^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2.

So <sum S_i·S_j> = ( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ℏ^2 ) / 2.

Therefore, <H> = A * ( <sum S_i·S_j> ) = A * ( <S_total^2> - 9/4 ℏ^2 ) / 2.

So to find <H>, we need to find <S_total^2>.

But how do we compute <S_total^2> for the given state psi?

Well, the state psi is symmetric and has total spin z-component S^z = 1/2 ℏ.

So let me think about the possible total spin states. For three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2.

The state psi is symmetric, so it must be part of the symmetric subspace. The symmetric subspace has dimensions 2 + 3 = 5? Wait, no, for three particles, the symmetric states are those with even permutation under exchange, which correspond to the states with total spin 3/2 and 1/2.

Wait, actually, the total symmetric states for three spin-1/2 particles form the basis for the symmetric representation, which has dimension 5 (since the total spin can be 3/2 or 1/2, with dimensions 2 and 3, respectively). So, to find <S_total^2>, we can figure out whether the state psi lies in the S=1/2 subspace or the S=3/2 subspace.

If it lies in the S=1/2 subspace, then <S_total^2> = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ℏ^2 = 3/4 ℏ^2. If it lies in the S=3/2 subspace, then <S_total^2> = (3/2)(5/2)ℏ^2 = 15/4 ℏ^2.

So we need to determine whether psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 3/4 ℏ^2 or 15/4 ℏ^2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the action of S_total^2 on the state psi.

But first, let's note that S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3).

We already know that acting on the state psi, S1^2, S2^2, S3^2 each give 3/4 ℏ^2, so their sum is 9/4 ℏ^2.

So S_total^2 |psi> = 9/4 ℏ^2 |psi> + 2*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3)|psi>.

Therefore, to find S_total^2 |psi>, we can compute 9/4 ℏ^2 |psi> plus twice the sum of the expectations.

But wait, actually, we can think of S_total^2 |psi> = 9/4 ℏ^2 |psi> + 2 sum S_i·S_j |psi>. So let's compute S_i·S_j acting on each term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value <psi|S_total^2|psi> directly.

So <psi| S_total^2 |psi> = <psi| (sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j) |psi> = sum <psi| S_i^2 |psi> + 2 sum <psi| S_i·S_j |psi>.

We already know sum <S_i^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2, as before.

So we need to compute sum <S_i·S_j> over i<j.

Each S_i·S_j = (1/4)(Pauli matrices i and j). So, the expectation value of S_i·S_j for a given pair is (ℏ^2/4) times the expectation value of the dot product of their Pauli matrices.

But since the state is symmetric, perhaps each pair has the same expectation value.

Wait, in the state psi, each term has two up spins and one down spin. So for each pair (i,j), we can compute the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Wait, let's pick two particles, say 1 and 2. What is <S1·S2>?

Since S1·S2 = (ℏ^2/4)( |↑↑><↑↑| + |↑↓><↑↓| + |↓↑><↓↑| + |↓↓><↓↓| ) + ... Wait, actually, the spin operator S1·S2 can be written in terms of the spin singlet and triplet states.

Recall that S1·S2 = (ℏ^2/4)(2 |singlet><singlet| + 3 |triplet><triplet|).

So, S1·S2 acting on a state gives (ℏ^2/4)(2*(-1)|singlet> + 3|triplet>).

Therefore, to compute <S1·S2>, we need to find the projection of psi onto the singlet and triplet states.

But wait, the state psi is a symmetric state with two up and one down spins. Let's see if this state is part of the triplet or singlet subspace.

Wait, the singlet subspace for two particles is antisymmetric, so it's orthogonal to our symmetric state. So, the overlap with the singlet is zero. Therefore, the state psi is entirely in the triplet subspace when considering the first two particles.

But considering all three particles, it's a bit more complicated because the interactions involve all three particles.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about all the pairwise contributions.

Alternatively, since each pair (i,j) in the state psi has certain spin configurations, we can compute <S_i·S_j> for each pair.

Let me pick pair (1,2). In the state psi, what's the expectation value of S1·S2?

In each term of psi, particles 1 and 2 can be |↑↑>, |↑↓> or |↓↑>. For each term, we can compute S1·S2 acting on that part.

So, let's write psi as:

psi = (1/sqrt{3}) [ |↑↑↓> + |↑↓↑> + |↓↑↑> ]

So, to compute <psi| S1·S2 |psi>, which is the same as (1/3) times the sum over each term in psi, of the expectation value of S1·S2 in that term.

So, for each term |a b c>, where a, b, c are spin states for particles 1, 2, 3 respectively, <a b c| S1·S2 |a b c> is equal to (ℏ^2/4) times the expectation value of (sigma1 · sigma2), where sigma are the Pauli matrices.

Since each term is a product state, S1·S2 acting on |a b c> is (ℏ^2/4) times (sigma1 · sigma2) acting on |a b>.

So, for each term, (sigma1 · sigma2)|a b> = |a b> (if a = b) + terms for a ≠ b.

Wait, no. Actually, (sigma1 · sigma2) |a b> = [ (sigma1 · sigma2)_{ab} ] |a b> + ... Wait, it's better to recall that (sigma1 · sigma2) = 2 S1·S2, so the expectation value <a b| sigma1 · sigma2 |a b> = (2 <S1·S2> ) * (ℏ^2/4) ?

Wait, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, the expectation value of S1·S2 in a given spin state |a b> is given by (1/2) [ (1 + a·b) ], but wait, no.

Wait, actually, for two spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S1·S2 in state |↑↑> is ( (ℏ/2)^2 ) * ( (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) )? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no. The operator S1·S2 is given by ( (S1^x S2^x ) + (S1^y S2^y ) + (S1^z S2^z ) ). Each S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z for spin 1/2 particles have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2.

So for a specific pair, say, particle 1 and 2, if they are both up, then S1^z = S2^z = ℏ/2, so S1^z S2^z = (ℏ/2)^2. Similarly, S1^x and S1^y are raising and lowering operators.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the expectation value of S1·S2 in a product state |s1 s2> is ( (s1 · s2) ) * (ℏ^2/4), where s1 and s2 are the Pauli spinors (i.e., their spin directions).

But wait, the inner product s1 · s2 for two spins is the spin-singlet and triplet states. For triplet states, s1 · s2 = +1, and for singlet, it's -1. So perhaps, for each pair (i,j), the expectation value in state |s_i s_j> is ( (s_i · s_j) ) * (ℏ^2/4). Therefore, if the state is a spin-triplet, s_i · s_j = 1, so the expectation value is ℏ^2/4. If it's a singlet, it's -ℏ^2/4.

Wait, so for each term in psi, we can compute the expectation value of S1·S2, S1·S3, S2·S3.

Looking at each term in psi:

1. |↑↑↓>:
   - S1·S2: Both are up, so s1 · s2 = 1 (triplet), expectation value = ℏ^2/4.
   - S1·S3: S1 is up, S3 is down, so s1 · s3 = -1 (singlet), expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.
   - S2·S3: S2 is up, S3 is down, so s2 · s3 = -1 (singlet), expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.

2. |↑↓↑>:
   - S1·S2: S1 up, S2 down, so s1 · s2 = -1 (singlet), expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.
   - S1·S3: S1 up, S3 up, so s1 · s3 = 1, expectation value = ℏ^2/4.
   - S2·S3: S2 down, S3 up, s2 · s3 = -1, expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.

3. |↓↑↑>:
   - S1·S2: S1 down, S2 up, so s1 · s2 = -1, expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.
   - S1·S3: S1 down, S3 up, so s1 · s3 = -1, expectation value = -ℏ^2/4.
   - S2·S3: S2 up, S3 up, so s2 · s3 = 1, expectation value = ℏ^2/4.

So in each term, the sum S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3 has two -ℏ^2/4 terms and one +ℏ^2/4 term, so total per term is (-1 -1 +1) * ℏ^2/4 = -1 * ℏ^2/4.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, for each term, sum of S_i·S_j:

For |↑↑↓>:

S1·S2 = +1, S1·S3 = -1, S2·S3 = -1. So sum is +1 -1 -1 = -1.

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>:

S1·S2 = -1, S1·S3 = +1, S2·S3 = -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Same for |↓↑↑>: S1·S2 = -1, S1·S3 = -1, S2·S3 = +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.

So each term contributes sum S_i·S_j = -ℏ^2/4 * (-1) ? Wait, no, because the expectation value per term is (-1) * (ℏ^2/4). So each term has an expectation value of (-1)*(ℏ^2/4).

But wait, no. Let me clarify:

The expectation value of S_i·S_j for a particular term is (s_i · s_j) * (ℏ^2/4). So if (s_i · s_j) is 1, it's +ℏ^2/4, if -1, it's -ℏ^2/4.

In each term, for each pair (i,j):

In |↑↑↓>:
- S1·S2 = 1 * (ℏ^2/4)
- S1·S3 = -1 * (ℏ^2/4)
- S2·S3 = -1 * (ℏ^2/4)
So sum for this term: (1 -1 -1)*(ℏ^2/4) = (-1) * (ℏ^2/4)

Similarly, for |↑↓↑>:
- S1·S2 = -1
- S1·S3 = +1
- S2·S3 = -1
Sum: (-1 +1 -1) = -1 * (ℏ^2/4)

Same for |↓↑↑>:
- S1·S2 = -1
- S1·S3 = -1
- S2·S3 = +1
Sum: (-1 -1 +1) = -1 * (ℏ^2/4)

Therefore, each term contributes -ℏ^2/4 to the sum. So, for each term, sum S_i·S_j = -ℏ^2/4.

Since psi is a superposition of these three terms, the expectation value of sum S_i·S_j is (1/3) * [ (-ℏ^2/4) + (-ℏ^2/4) + (-ℏ^2/4) ] = (1/3)*(-3ℏ^2/4) = -ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, <sum S_i·S_j> = -ℏ^2/4.

Then, going back to the Hamiltonian, H = A * sum S_i·S_j. So <H> = A*(-ℏ^2/4) = -A ℏ^2 /4.

Wait, but the problem says the expectation value is 3/4 A hbar^2. Hmm, so either I made a mistake here or there is a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, in the initial expansion, S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = sum S_i^2 + 2 sum S_i·S_j.

So, to compute <S_total^2> = <sum S_i^2> + 2 <sum S_i·S_j>.

We have <sum S_i^2> = 3*(3/4)ℏ^2 = 9/4 ℏ^2.

We found <sum S_i·S_j> = -ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, <S_total^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2 + 2*(-ℏ^2/4) = 9/4 ℏ^2 - ℏ^2/2 = (9/4 - 2/4) ℏ^2 = 7/4 ℏ^2.

Wait, but for S=1/2, S_total^2 should be (1/2)(1/2 +1)ℏ^2 = 3/4 ℏ^2. However, here we get 7/4 ℏ^2, which is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is in a different representation.

Wait, but if we compute <S_total^2> as 7/4 ℏ^2, which would correspond to S_total = sqrt( (7/4 - 1) ) ℏ = sqrt(3/4) ℏ, which is not an integer spin. That can't be right because the total spin S must be an integer or half-integer.

Therefore, my previous calculation must have an error.

Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the expectation value of S_i·S_j.

Wait, in each term, the sum S_i·S_j is -ℏ^2/4, as above.

But since psi is a symmetric combination of these three terms, the expectation value is (1/3) of the sum of these three.

So (1/3)*( -ℏ^2/4 - ℏ^2/4 - ℏ^2/4 ) = (1/3)*(-3ℏ^2/4) = -ℏ^2/4. So that seems correct.

But then, the expectation value of S_total^2 is 9/4 ℏ^2 + 2*(-ℏ^2/4) = 9/4 - 2/4 = 7/4 ℏ^2, which is 1.75 ℏ^2.

But for S_total, S_total(S_total +1) = 7/4 => S_total = sqrt(7/4 -1) = sqrt(3/4) = √3 / 2, which is non-integer. That can't be possible because the total spin of three spin-1/2 particles must be either 1/2 or 3/2.

This implies an error in the process.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Hamiltonian is H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2)/2 ). So perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Wait, no, H = A*(S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3) = A*( (S_total^2 - sum S_i^2 ) / 2 )

So, <H> = A/2 * ( <S_total^2> - <sum S_i^2> )

So plugging in, <H> = A/2 * (7/4 ℏ^2 - 9/4 ℏ^2) = A/2 * (-2/4 ℏ^2) = A/2 * (-ℏ^2/2) = -A ℏ^2 /4.

So according to this, the expectation value is -A ℏ^2 /4. But the question says the expectation value is 3/4 A ℏ^2. Hmm, so perhaps I have a sign error.

Wait, let's see. The operator S1·S2 is actually (1/4) of the dot product of Pauli matrices. But perhaps I should have included the factor of ℏ^2 in S_i·S_j.

Wait, no. Each S_i is (ℏ/2) σ_i, so S_i·S_j = (ℏ/2)^2 (σ_i · σ_j).

Therefore, S1·S2 = (ℏ^2/4)(σ1·σ2). Therefore, the operator S1·S2 has eigenvalues ±ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, when I computed <S1·S2> for each pair, it's (s1·s2) * (ℏ^2/4). So if s1·s2 is 1, then it's +ℏ^2/4, if -1, then -ℏ^2/4.

So in the state psi, for each pair, their s_i·s_j is either +1 or -1.

Wait, in the first term |↑↑↓>:

S1·S2: both up, which is triplet, so s1·s2 = 1, so expectation value +ℏ^2/4.

S1·S3: S1 up, S3 down, so s1·s3 = -1, so expectation value -ℏ^2/4.

Similarly, S2·S3: same as S1·S3, -ℏ^2/4.

So sum for that term: ( +1 -1 -1 ) * ℏ^2/4 = (-1) * ℏ^2/4.

Same for each term in psi. So in each term, the sum S_i·S_j is -ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, the expectation value for each term is -ℏ^2/4, and since psi is a symmetric combination, the total expectation is (1/3)( -ℏ^2/4 )*3 = -ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, <H> = A * (-ℏ^2 /4) = -A ℏ^2 /4.

But the given answer is 3/4 A ℏ^2. So either I have a miscalculation or the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value of S_total^2.

Earlier, I thought that <S_total^2> = <sum S_i^2> + 2 <sum S_i·S_j> = 9/4 ℏ^2 + 2*(-ℏ^2/4) = 9/4 - 1/2 = 7/4 ℏ^2.

But for S_total^2, if the state is a combination of S=1/2 and S=3/2, perhaps it's different.

Wait, actually, the state psi is a symmetric state with S^z = 1/2. So maybe it's a singlet state with S=1/2.

But wait, the S=1/2 state would have S_total^2 = (1/2)(1/2 +1) ℏ^2 = 3/4 ℏ^2.

Wait, but if the state is in S=1/2 subspace, then <S_total^2> = 3/4 ℏ^2. Therefore, plugging into <H>:

<H> = (A / 2) ( <S_total^2> - <sum S_i^2> ) = (A / 2) ( 3/4 ℏ^2 - 9/4 ℏ^2 ) = (A / 2)( -6/4 ℏ^2 ) = (A / 2)( -3/2 ℏ^2 ) = - (3/4) A ℏ^2.

But the given answer is 3/4 A ℏ^2. So perhaps I have a sign error.

Wait, another thought: maybe the state is not in the S=1/2 subspace, but in the S=3/2 subspace. If that's the case, then <S_total^2> would be (3/2)(5/2)ℏ^2 = 15/4 ℏ^2.

Then, plugging into <H> = (A / 2)(15/4 ℏ^2 - 9/4 ℏ^2 ) = (A / 2)(6/4 ℏ^2 ) = (A / 2)(3/2 ℏ^2 ) = (3/4) A ℏ^2.

So if psi is in the S=3/2 subspace, then the expectation value would be positive.

But is psi in the S=3/2 subspace?

To check that, we need to see if psi is an eigenstate of S_total^2 with eigenvalue 15/4 ℏ^2.

Alternatively, if I compute <S_total^2> and get 15/4 ℏ^2, then it's in S=3/2.

But earlier, using the pairwise expectation values, I computed <S_total^2> = 7/4 ℏ^2, which is inconsistent.

So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute <S_total^2> correctly.

Wait, another approach: compute <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> + 2 <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3>.

We have <S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2.

We have <S1·S2 + S1·S3 + S2·S3> = -ℏ^2/4.

Therefore, <(S1 + S2 + S3)^2> = 9/4 ℏ^2 + 2*(-ℏ^2/4) = 9/4 - 1/2 = 9/4 - 2/4 = 7/4 ℏ^2.

So <S_total^2> = 7/4 ℏ^2.

But for three spin-1/2 particles, the possible total spins are 3/2 and 1/2. So 7/4 ℏ^2 corresponds to S_total = sqrt(7/4 - 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. But 1 is not a possible spin for three spin-1/2 particles. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalues of S_total^2 are S_total(S_total + 1) ℏ^2. So if <S_total^2> = 7/4 ℏ^2, that would imply that S_total(S_total + 1) = 7/4. But S_total must be an integer or half-integer. 7/4 is 1.75, which is not an integer, so that can't be.

This suggests that the state psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2. Therefore, the state is not an eigenstate of H either, because H is a function of S_total^2.

Therefore, since psi is not an eigenstate of S_total^2, it's not an eigenstate of H. Therefore, the expectation value of H is -A ℏ^2 /4.

But the given answer is 3/4 A ℏ^2. So perhaps I made a sign error.

Wait, let me check the definition of S_total. S_total is the sum of the individual spins, so S_total^2 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2.

When I computed <S_total^2>, I got 7/4 ℏ^2, but that's not an eigenvalue. Therefore, the state is not an eigenstate, so H is not diagonal in this basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to consider that the state is a linear combination of different S_total states.

Wait, so perhaps the state psi is a symmetric combination of states with different total spins.

But to compute the expectation value, we must consider the contributions from all possible total spin states.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the state psi is in the subspace of symmetric states with certain total spin.
