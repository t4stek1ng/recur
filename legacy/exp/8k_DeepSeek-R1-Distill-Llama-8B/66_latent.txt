<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: An ARMA(p,q) (p, q are integers bigger than zero) model will have. The options are: A.

An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags, D. An acf that is zero after p lags and a pacf that is zero after q lags. Why the correct answer is C. An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've got this question about ARMA(p, q) models and their autocorrelation functions (acfs) and partial autocorrelation functions (pacfs). I need to figure out why the correct answer is C. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I recall that an ARMA model is a combination of an AR model and an MA model. Specifically, it's an AR model of order p followed by an MA model of order q. So, ARMA(p, q) = AR(p) + MA(q).

Now, let's think about the acf and pacf for such a model. The acf of an AR model usually decays geometrically, right? Because AR models are stationary and their autocorrelations don't die out quickly; instead, they follow a specific pattern, often decaying geometrically as the lag increases.

On the other hand, the MA model's acf is zero after q lags because the moving average model assumes that the past errors (or observations) have no impact after a certain point—in this case, q lags. So, for an MA(q) model, the acf is zero for lags greater than q.

But wait, when we combine AR and MA models, what happens to the acf? I think the overall acf is a combination of the AR and MA acfs. So, the acf of ARMA(p, q) should retain the decaying geometric nature of the AR part and have the zeros of the MA part beyond lag q. Is that right?

Hold on, no, maybe I got that mixed up. The acf of the ARMA model is a combination of the AR and MA effects. Actually, the ARMA model is a linear combination of an AR(p) and an MA(q), so the acf is the sum of the acfs of the AR(p) and MA(q). 

So, for AR(p), the acf decays geometrically. For MA(q), beyond lag q, the acf is zero. Therefore, when we add these two, the resulting acf should have the geometric decay from the AR part and the zeros from the MA part. Wait, but actually, the MA(q) will affect the autocorrelation function beyond its own order q, right?

Hold on, no, Maybe I should compute the PACF for ARMA(1 got that mixed up. The acf of the ARMA model is a combination of the AR and MA effects. Actually, the ARMA model is a linear combination of an AR(p) and an MA(q), so the acf is the sum of the acfs of the AR(p) and MA(q). 

So, for AR(p), the acf decays geometrically. For MA(q), beyond lag q, the acf is zero. Therefore, when we add these two, the resulting acf should have the geometric decay from the AR part and the zeros from the MA part. Wait, but actually, the MA(q) will affect the autocorrelation function beyond its own order q, right?

Hold on, no, maybe it's considering only the minimum of p and q? got that mixed up. The acf of the ARMA model is a combination of the AR and MA effects. Actually, the ARMA model is a linear combination of an AR(p) and an MA(q), so the acf is the sum of the acfs of the AR(p) and MA(q). 

So, for AR(p), the acf decays geometrically. For MA(q), beyond lag q, the acf is zero. Therefore, when we add these two, the resulting acf should have the geometric decay from the AR part and the zeros from the MA part. Wait, but actually, the MA(q) will affect the autocorrelation function beyond its own order q, right?
