<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: At 20°C, a pipe open at both ends resonates at a frequency of 440 hertz. At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20°C ?. The options are: A. 414 Hz, B. 427 Hz, C. 433 Hz, D. 440 Hz. Why the correct answer is A. 414 Hz?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a pipe resonating at a certain frequency, and I need to figure out what happens when the temperature changes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that at 20°C, the pipe resonates at 440 Hz. Then, on a cold day, the speed of sound is 3% lower, and I need to find the new frequency. The options are A. 414 Hz, B. 427 Hz, C. 433 Hz, D. 440 Hz. The answer is supposed to be A, 414 Hz, but I want to understand why.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when you have a pipe open at both ends, it's like a open-pipe resonance problem. The resonance frequency depends on the dimensions of the pipe and the speed of sound in the medium. The formula for the frequency is something like:

f = v / (2L)

Wait, is that right? Or is it a different formula? Let me think. For a pipe open at both ends, the resonance frequency is given by:

f = v / (2L)

where v is the speed of sound in the medium, and L is the length of the pipe. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound and inversely proportional to the length.

So, if the speed of sound decreases, the frequency should also decrease because frequency is directly proportional to v. Conversely, if the speed increases, the frequency increases. So, in this problem, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20°C, so the frequency should be 3% lower as well.

Alright, is that right? Or is it a different formula? Let me see. For a pipe open at both ends, the resonance frequency is given by:

f = v / (2L)

where v is the speed of sound in the medium, and L is the length of the pipe. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound and inversely proportional to the length.

So, if the speed of sound decreases, the frequency should also decrease because frequency is directly proportional to v. Conversely, if the speed increases, the frequency increases. So, in this problem, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20°C, so the frequency should be 3% lower as well.

Then, is that right? Or is it a different formula? Let me try again. For a pipe open at both ends, the resonance frequency is given by:

f = v / (2L)

where v is the speed of sound in the medium, and L is the length of the pipe. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound and inversely proportional to the length.

So, if the speed of sound decreases, the frequency should also decrease because frequency is directly proportional to v. Conversely, if the speed increases, the frequency increases. So, in this problem, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20°C, so the frequency should be 3% lower as well.
