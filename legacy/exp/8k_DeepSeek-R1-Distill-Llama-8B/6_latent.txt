Okay, so the local firefighters are doing a fill the boot fundraiser, right? Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first three hours, they've already made $2100. Now, they want to know how many more hours they need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming they raise an equal amount every hour. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this.

First off, they have a total goal of $6300. They've already raised $2100 in the first three hours. So, I guess I need to find out how much more money they need to raise after the first three hours. That would be the goal minus what they've already made. Let me write that down.

Total goal: $6300

Money raised in 3 hours: $2100

So, money needed after 3 hours: 6300 - 2100 = $4200

Okay, so they need an additional $4200. Now, they want to know how many more hours they need to work, assuming they raise the same amount each hour. That means each hour they raise $4200 divided by the number of hours. Hmm, let me think about the division here.

Let’s denote the number of additional hours needed as 'h'. Since they raise the same amount each hour, each hour they raise $4200/h. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. If they need $4200 and they raise, let's say, $x each hour, then the number of hours needed would be 4200 divided by x, right? But in this case, since the amount per hour is equal, we can actually find the amount per hour by dividing the total needed by the number of hours.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider the rate at which they're fundraising. If they've already raised $2100 in 3 hours, that means their rate is $2100 divided by 3 hours, which is $700 per hour. So, each hour, they raise $700. Therefore, if they need $4200 more, they can divide 4200 by 700 to find out how many hours that will take.

Calculating that: 4200 divided by 700. Let me do that division. 700 goes into 4200 six times because 700 times 6 is 4200. So, that would mean they need 6 more hours.

But wait, the question says "for how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal." So, does that include the first three hours or is it just the additional hours? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

"After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100. For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?"

No wait, the question says "for how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal." So, does that include the first three hours or is it just the additional hours? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to compute the rate at which they are raising funds.

"After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100. For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?"

Therefore wait, the question says "for how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal." So, does that include the first three hours or is it just the additional hours? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think.
