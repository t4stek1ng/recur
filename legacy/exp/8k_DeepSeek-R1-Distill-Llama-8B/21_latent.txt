<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Let P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself (i.e., is recursive). If P is guaranteed to terminate, which of the following statements must be true?
I. P has a local variable.
II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.
III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.. The options are: A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. II and III only. Why the correct answer is A. I only?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this question about a recursive procedure P. It says that P is guaranteed to terminate. Then, I need to figure out which statements must be true: I, II, or III. The options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, D. II and III only. The correct answer is supposed to be A, which is I only. Hmm, I need to understand why that is.

First, let me go through each statement one by one. 

Statement I: P has a local variable. Hmm, so for a recursive procedure, does it necessarily have a local variable? Well, in recursive functions, typically you have some variables that are used for the recursive calls. For example, in a function like P(n), each call has its own copy or uses some variables in its scope. But wait, the base case—what does it do? If the base case is reached, does it even need a local variable? Maybe not. Let me think. Suppose P is a simple recursive function that doesn't use any variables besides the parameters. Wait, in that case, maybe it doesn't have any local variables. Or does the base case not needing a variable make it have no local variables? Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, no, the base case is just a condition. So, if P is a recursive procedure, even in the base case, unless it uses a local variable for some computation, it doesn't need one. So, for example, if P(n) is defined as P(n-1) + n, then it has a local variable n, but maybe if it's defined as just returning something without using any variables besides parameters, maybe it doesn't have a local variable. So, is it necessary that a recursive procedure must have a local variable?

Wait, I think it depends on whether the procedure does something besides just calling itself. If a recursive procedure only has one statement, like P(n) { return P(n-1); }, then it doesn't have any local variables because it's just making recursive calls. So, that's a problem for Statement I because in such a case, P doesn't have a local variable. So, Statement I is not necessarily true.

Therefore, I think it depends on whether the procedure does something besides just calling itself. If a recursive procedure only has one statement, like P(n) { return P(n-1); }, then it doesn't have any local variables because it's just making recursive calls. So, that's a problem for Statement I because in such a case, P doesn't have a local variable. So, Statement I is not necessarily true.

However, I think it depends on whether the procedure does something besides just calling itself. If a recursive procedure only has one statement, like P(n) { return P(n-1); }, then it doesn't have any local variables because it's just making recursive calls. So, that's a problem for Statement I because in such a case, P doesn't have a local variable. So, Statement I is not necessarily true.
