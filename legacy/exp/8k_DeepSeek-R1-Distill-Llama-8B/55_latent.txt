<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was. The options are: A. mc^2, B. 2mc^2, C. 3mc^2, D. 4mc^2. Why the correct answer is C. 3mc^2?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I came across this physics problem, and I want to figure out why the correct answer is 3mc². Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem goes like this: A photon strikes an electron of mass m that's initially at rest. This creates an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed in the process, and the positron and the two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. We need to find the energy of the photon, and the options are A. mc², B. 2mc², C. 3mc², D. 4mc².

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about energy and momentum conservation here because when a photon interacts with matter, both energy and momentum should be conserved.

First, the initial setup: an electron at rest, so its energy is just its rest energy, which is mc². The photon comes in with some energy, let's call that E_photon. When the photon hits the electron, it creates an electron-positron pair. So now, instead of just an electron, we have two electrons and a positron moving off.

Wait, actually, the problem says the photon is destroyed, so its energy is transferred to the particles. The positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, the total number of electrons is two because one electron was originally there, and one was created as a positron, but actually, no. Wait, the original electron is hit by the photon, and it creates an electron-positron pair. So, that means we have three particles moving off: the original electron, the positron, and the second electron? Wait, no, wait—the original electron is at rest, and when the photon hits it, it creates an electron-positron pair. So, actually, it's the original electron, plus an electron and a positron. But wait, but the problem says the positron and two electrons move off. So, does that mean that the original electron is still there? Or does it mean that the original electron is split into two electrons and a positron?

Alternatively, actually, the problem says the photon is destroyed, so its energy is transferred to the particles. The positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds. So, the total number of electrons is two because one electron was originally there, and one was created as a positron, but actually, no. Wait, the original electron is hit by the photon, and it creates an electron-positron pair.
