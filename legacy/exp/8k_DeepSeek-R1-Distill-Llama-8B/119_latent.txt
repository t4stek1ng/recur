<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).
Why the correct answer is A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I have this question about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about two parts: part A and part B. For part A, we're looking for the compound that does not show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, we need to determine which between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Starting with part A: tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the migration of a hydrogen and a pair of electrons, leading to a different structural arrangement but maintaining the same molecular formula. Common types include keto-enol tautomerism, where a carbonyl group can tautomerize into an enol form.

Looking at the two compounds given: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It can exist in two forms: para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone, which are diastereomers. However, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Since it's a fully conjugated aromatic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other, it doesn't have the same hydrogen arrangement that would allow for enolization. Unlike compounds like acetone or acetaldehyde, which can tautomerize, benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups) in positions that would allow for such a shift without disrupting the aromaticity. So, benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a cyclic triketone. Each carbonyl group is at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of a cyclohexane ring. Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is adjacent to two other carbonyls. In such a structure, there are no hydrogen atoms on the carbonyl carbons, but are there any alpha hydrogens? Wait, in this case, the carbonyl groups are part of a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl is between two CH2 groups. Let me visualize the structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, but wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups at every other carbon. So, each carbon with a carbonyl group is connected to two other carbonyls and a CH2 group. So, the alpha position is the adjacent carbon, which is a CH2 group. Each CH2 is connected to a carbonyl. So, each of those carbonyl carbons is attached to two CH2 groups.

Do the CH2 groups have any hydrogens that can participate in tautomerism? Tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl (alpha carbon). So, if there's a hydrogen on the alpha carbon, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the carbonyl groups is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbonyls and two CH2 groups. So, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl group is attached to two CH2 groups. Now, the CH2 groups are attached to two other atoms (the carbonyl and another CH2). Wait, that's not quite the case. Let me think again.

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So, for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, positions 1, 3, and 5 have carbonyl groups. Each of these carbonyl carbons is connected to two -CH2- groups. Wait, actually, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So, position 1 is connected to 6 and 2; if position 1 is a carbonyl, then position 2 is a CH2 connected to position 1. But if position 3 is a carbonyl, then position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. So, position 2 is adjacent to two carbonyls (positions 1 and 3), making it an alpha position. So, position 2 has a CH2 group, which is an alpha carbon.

Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (carbonyl) and position 3 (another carbonyl). Therefore, position 2 is an alpha position because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group. Similarly, positions 4, 6, and so on, but let's focus on position 2. Position 2 is a CH2 group attached to two carbonyls. So, the CH2 at position 2 is connected to two carbonyls. So, the hydrogen atoms on position 2's CH2 group are alpha hydrogens, because they are attached to an alpha carbon (adjacent to a carbonyl). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism.

However, no, in a cyclohexane ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (carbonyl) and position 3 (another carbonyl). Therefore, position 2 is an alpha position because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group. Similarly, positions 4, 6, and so on, but let's focus on position 2. Position 2 is a CH2 group attached to two carbonyls. So, the CH2 at position 2 is connected to two carbonyls. So, the hydrogen atoms on position 2's CH2 group are alpha hydrogens, because they are attached to an alpha carbon (adjacent to a carbonyl). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism.

Yes, no, in a cyclohexane ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (carbonyl) and position 3 (another carbonyl). Therefore, position 2 is an alpha position because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group. Similarly, positions 4, 6, and so on, but let's focus on position 2. Position 2 is a CH2 group attached to two carbonyls. So, the CH2 at position 2 is connected to two carbonyls. So, the hydrogen atoms on position 2's CH2 group are alpha hydrogens, because they are attached to an alpha carbon (adjacent to a carbonyl). Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism.
