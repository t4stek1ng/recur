<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>You want to quantify the upregulation of a transcript from the mouse hypertrophic muscles and compare it to the levels in the wild-type using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. You isolate the tissues and carefully prepare the RNA for the cDNA synthesis. You proceed with the qPCR in a two-step process. For the second step, you need to design a pair of primers that would allow for the specific detection of the transcript in question. You identified the transcript's genomic sequence that is 23.7 kb long. The ATG is at 6867 bp, following a 128 bp 5'UTR that stretches over an intron. The second exon ends at 8272 bp. There are three more exons; the last exon contains the stop at 23276 bp and is around 500 bp long. Between the second and the third is the gene's largest intron of 7367bp in length. The third is the largest exon, 2126 bp long.
Considering their length of 20 bp and an appropriate annealing temperature, how do you position your primer pair for optimal transcript quantification?
Why the correct answer is forward around 1 bp and reverse around 6900 bp on the genomic DNA?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how to design a primer pair for a quantitative PCR (qPCR) to detect a specific transcript in mouse hypertrophic muscles. The goal is to compare the transcript levels between the experimental muscles and wild-type using this qPCR. 

First, let me understand the structure of the gene based on the information provided. The transcript is 23.7 kb long, which is pretty large, so designing primers could be a bit challenging. The genomic sequence is 23.7 kb, which is quite long, so introns must be present. The ATG starts at 6867 bp, following a 128 bp 5'UTR that spans an intron. That's interesting because the 5'UTR is split between exons. 

The second exon ends at 8272 bp. Then, there are three more exons. The largest intron is between the second and third exons, which is 7367 bp. The third exon is the largest, being 2126 bp long. The last exon contains the stop at 23276 bp and is about 500 bp long. 

So, the gene structure is something like this:

1. 5'UTR (128 bp) - split by an intron
2. Exon 1 (from 6867 to 8272)
3. Intron of 7367 bp (so from 8273 to 8272 + 7367 = 15639?)
Wait, let me make sure. The second exon ends at 8272, so the intron after that is 7367 bp long. Therefore, the next exon (third exon) starts at 8272 + 7367 + 1 = 15640? Wait, no, because the intron starts right after the second exon. So the intron goes from 8273 to 8272 + 7367 = 15639. So the third exon starts at 15640.

Then, the third exon is 2126 bp long, so it ends at 15640 + 2126 - 1 = 17765. Then, there's another intron, but the length isn't provided for that. The fourth exon ends at 23276, which is the stop codon, and is 500 bp long. So from 23276 - 500 + 1 = 22777 to 23276.

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try again.

The transcript is 23.7 kb long, so from 1 to 23700 bp (since 23.7 kb = 23700 bp). The ATG is at 6867 bp. So, the transcript starts at 1, but the coding sequence starts at 6867.

But the 5'UTR is 128 bp, which spans an intron. So, the 5'UTR is split: part is in exon 1 and part is in exon 2? Or is it that the 5'UTR is before exon 1? Wait, the ATG is in exon 1, and the 5'UTR precedes it. So, the 5'UTR is 128 bp, but it's split by an intron. So, the 5'UTR is not continuous. So, exon 1 starts after the 5'UTR? Or the 5'UTR is part of exon 1 and another exon?

However the 5'UTR is 128 bp, which spans an intron. So, the 5'UTR is split: part is in exon 1 and part is in exon 2? Or is it that the 5'UTR is before exon 1? Wait, the ATG is in exon 1, and the 5'UTR precedes it. So, the 5'UTR is 128 bp, but it's split by an intron. So, the 5'UTR is not continuous. So, exon 1 starts after the 5'UTR? Or the 5'UTR is part of exon 1 and another exon?

So the 5'UTR is 128 bp, which spans an intron. So, the 5'UTR is split: part is in exon 1 and part is in exon 2? Or is it that the 5'UTR is before exon 1? Wait, the ATG is in exon 1, and the 5'UTR precedes it. So, the 5'UTR is 128 bp, but it's split by an intron. So, the 5'UTR is not continuous. So, exon 1 starts after the 5'UTR? Or the 5'UTR is part of exon 1 and another exon?
