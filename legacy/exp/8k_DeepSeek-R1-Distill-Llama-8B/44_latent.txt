Okay, so I have this question about light reflection and refraction. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: White light is normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an index of refraction of 1.33. There's a thin layer of oil, 500 nm thick, floating on top of the water. The oil has a higher index of refraction, 1.5. The options are four wavelengths, and the correct answer is supposedly D, 650 nm. I need to understand why.

First, I remember something about thin film interference. When light hits a thin film, some of it reflects off the top surface, and some goes through and reflects off the bottom surface. These two reflected waves can interfere with each other, creating either constructive or destructive interference.

Since the question is about the "most strongly reflected wavelength," I think this refers to the wavelength that results in constructive interference, which would be the one that reflects the most, or is brightest. So, we need to find the wavelength that causes constructive interference.

I recall that constructive interference happens when the path difference between the two reflected waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength. The formula for the path difference is:

Path difference = 2 * n * t

Here, n is the index of refraction of the film, and t is the thickness of the film. But wait, I think that's only for the case where the light reflects off both surfaces. But also, there's a phase change that happens when light reflects off a medium with a higher index of refraction. So, if the light goes from air (n=1) to a medium (n > 1), the reflection causes a phase shift of π (or 180 degrees). If it reflects off a medium with lower n, there's no phase shift.

In this case, the oil has a higher index of refraction than water? Wait, no. The oil's n is 1.5, and the water's n is 1.33. So, oil has a higher n than water. So, when light first hits the oil, it reflects off the oil-water interface. Since oil has a higher n than water, that reflection (from air to oil) will have a phase shift of π. Then, the light goes through the oil, reflects off the water (which is a lower n than oil), so that reflection will not have a phase shift. So, the two reflections: one has a phase shift, the other doesn't.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify:

1. First reflection: air to oil. Since oil has a higher n than air, reflection causes a phase shift of π.

2. Second reflection: oil to water. Since oil has higher n than water, reflection here also has a phase shift of π.

Wait, that's a problem. So, both reflections cause a phase shift. But each reflection's phase shift depends on the medium they're reflecting off.

Actually, that's a problem. So, both reflections cause a phase shift. But each reflection's phase shift depends on the medium they're reflecting off.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, both reflections cause a phase shift. But each reflection's phase shift depends on the medium they're reflecting off.
