<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Which of the following statements are true concerning information criteria?

(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion

(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall

(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion

(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent. The options are: A. (ii) and (iv) only, B. (i) and (iii) only, C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only, D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). Why the correct answer is A. (ii) and (iv) only?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this question about information criteria, and I need to figure out which statements are true. There are four statements, (i) through (iv), and then four options about which ones are correct. The options are A to D, each listing a combination of statements. The answer is given as A, which is (ii) and (iv) only, but I need to understand why.

First, let me recall what information criteria are. I remember that information criteria are used in statistics to compare models. They are based on the idea of maximizing the information gain, which is similar to minimizing the Akaike information. The main ones I know are AIC (Akaike's information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion, also known as Schwarz's information criterion). I think BIC is sometimes called Schwarz's because of the different penalty terms.

So, let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement (i): "Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion."

Hmm. Adjusted R-squared is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the data. It’s R-squared adjusted for overfitting by the number of predictors. But is it considered an information criterion? I think information criteria like AIC and BIC are based on the likelihood function and have a different penalty structure. Adjusted R-squared is more of a goodness-of-fit measure. So, I don't think adjusted R-squared is an information criterion. Therefore, statement (i) is false.

Statement (ii): "If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall."

Wait, residual sum of squares refers to the sum of squared errors (SSE). If adding a term reduces SSE, that means the model fits the data better, right? But how does that affect information criteria? For AIC, the value is computed as -2*log(likelihood) + a constant. So, adding a term that reduces the residual sum of squares would increase the log-likelihood because log of a smaller number is negative, but the negative of that would be more. Wait, let me think.
