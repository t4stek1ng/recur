Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is about figuring out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options provided are not listed, but it's mentioned that the correct answer is 10^-11 eV. Hmm, I need to understand why that is the case.

First off, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are often very close together, especially in systems like atoms or molecules where fine structure arises from various effects like the Lamb shift. When we talk about distinguishing two energy levels, it probably has to do with their spectral lines or something related to how we can detect the difference in their energies.

The lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the states, which are related to their energy widths due to the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the energy and the lifetime of a state are related by ΔEΔt ≈ ħ/2. So, the energy width ( ΔE ) of each state is inversely proportional to their lifetimes.

Let me write that down:

ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt)

Where ΔE is the energy width, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and Δt is the lifetime of the state.

So, for E1 with lifetime 10^-9 seconds, the energy width is:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 * 10^-9 s)

Similarly, for E2 with lifetime 10^-8 seconds, the energy width is:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (2 * 10^-8 s)

Calculating these, but I think the exact values might not be necessary right now. The main point is that the lifetimes are directly related to the energy widths.

Now, to distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the uncertainty principle limit, otherwise, their spectral lines would overlap, making it impossible to resolve them. So, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths, right?

Wait, actually, if two states are too close in energy, their spectral lines will overlap, making them indistinguishable. So, to resolve them, the energy difference should be at least larger than the sum of their linewidths.

But wait, is it the sum or the difference? Hmm.

If we have two states, E1 and E2, with energy widths ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the condition for resolving them would be that the energy difference Δ should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. So:

ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2

So, Δ > ΔE_total

Therefore, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But wait, is it the sum or the difference? Hmm.

If we have two states, E1 and E2, with energy widths ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the condition for resolving them would be that the energy difference Δ should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. So:

ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2

So, Δ > ΔE_total

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So wait, is it the sum or the difference? Hmm.

If we have two states, E1 and E2, with energy widths ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the condition for resolving them would be that the energy difference Δ should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. So:

ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2

So, Δ > ΔE_total

Ah, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.
