<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Consider an electron in the n = 4, l = 1 state in hydrogen. Which of the following final states can NOT be reached by an allowed transition?. The options are: A. n = 3, l = 2, B. n = 3, l = 1, C. n = 3, l = 0, D. n = 2, l = 0. Why the correct answer is C. n = 3, l = 0?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I've got this question about electrons and allowed transitions in hydrogen. The question is asking which final state can't be reached from an electron initially in the n=4, l=1 state. The options are A through D, with option C being the correct answer, n=3, l=0. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, let me recall some basics about atomic orbitals and transitions. Electrons in atoms are described by their quantum numbers n, l, and m_l. The n is the principal quantum number, which defines the energy level; l is the azimuthal or angular momentum quantum number, and m_l is the magnetic quantum number.

For a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1. So for n=4, l can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The initial state is n=4, l=1, so the electron is in a state with l=1. Now, when an electron undergoes a transition, it can change its l value, but only by certain amounts due to the selection rules.

I remember the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1, which means the electron can only transition between states where the angular momentum quantum number changes by one. Also, Δn can be 0, ±1, but I think for allowed electric dipole transitions, Δn can be 0, ±1, but not necessarily all of those are allowed for every transition.

Wait, actually, the selection rules for hydrogen are Δn = ±1 and Δl = ±1 for electric dipole transitions. But I also need to remember that m_l can change by 0, ±1, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

So, starting from n=4, l=1, possible transitions are limited to Δn = ±1 and Δl = ±1.

Let me list out the possible final states. Each option has a specific n and l. Let's check each one.

Option A: n=3, l=2. So, n changes by -1 (from 4 to 3), and l changes by +1 (from 1 to 2). That's Δn = -1 and Δl = +1. Both changes are allowed because Δn can be ±1 and Δl can be ±1. So, A is possible.

Option B: n=3, l=1. Here, n changes by -1 and l remains the same (since l=1 to l=1 is a change of 0). Wait, but Δl must be ±1. So, if l doesn't change, is that allowed? Hmm, no. The selection rule for electric dipole transitions requires that the angular momentum changes, so Δl must be ±1. Therefore, l cannot stay the same. So, this transition is not allowed? But wait, in the question, they're asking which final state cannot be reached by an allowed transition. So, does that mean that B can't be reached?

But hold on, I'm confused because if Δl can only be ±1, then in option B, l doesn't change, so that's not allowed. So, B is impossible. But the correct answer is C. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.

Alternatively hold on, I'm confused because if Δl can only be ±1, then in option B, l doesn't change, so that's not allowed. So, B is impossible. But the correct answer is C. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.

Here hold on, I'm confused because if Δl can only be ±1, then in option B, l doesn't change, so that's not allowed. So, B is impossible. But the correct answer is C. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.
