First, I'll define the number of silver and gold pesos Axel has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so that's 2 multiplied by 50, which is 100 silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so that's 80 plus 40, totaling 120 gold pesos.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together by adding Axel's and Anna's amounts.

The total silver pesos are 50 plus 100, which equals 150.

The total gold pesos are 80 plus 120, which equals 200.

Finally, I'll add these totals together to find the combined number of pesos.

150 silver pesos plus 200 gold pesos equals 350 pesos in total.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together.

**Step 1: Define the Variables**

- **Axel's Silver Pesos (S₁):** 50
- **Axel's Gold Pesos (G₁):** 80

**Step 2: Determine Anna's Silver Pesos**

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel:
\[ S₂ = 2 \times S₁ = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Determine Anna's Gold Pesos**

Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ G₂ = G₁ + 40 = 80 + 40 = 120 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Total Silver Pesos Together**

\[ \text{Total Silver} = S₁ + S₂ = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the Total Gold Pesos Together**

\[ \text{Total Gold} = G₁ + G₂ = 80 + 120 = 200 \]

**Step 6: Find the Combined Total Number of Pesos**

\[ \text{Total Pesos} = \text{Total Silver} + \text{Total Gold} = 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Wait, that doesn't add up to 175. Let me check my calculations again.

Oops, I think I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me revisit the steps.

**Revised Step 2: Determine Anna's Silver Pesos**

Anna has twice as many **silver** pesos as Axel:
\[ S₂ = 2 \times S₁ = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
**But this step is correct.**

**Revised Step 3: Determine Anna's Gold Pesos**

Anna has **40 more** gold pesos than Axel:
\[ G₂ = G₁ + 40 = 80 + 40 = 120 \]
**This is also correct.**

**Combined Total:**
\[ 150 \text{ (Silver)} + 200 \text{ (Gold)} = 350 \text{ Pesos} \]

Wait, 350 is the correct total, not 175. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the original problem statement or the provided answer. Let me double-check the original problem.

**Original Problem:**
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together? Why the correct answer is 175?"

It appears there's a discrepancy here. According to my calculations, the total should be 350, not 175. Perhaps the original problem statement was misinterpreted.

**Final Answer:**

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\).

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, totaling 130 pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 100 silver pesos, and 40 more gold pesos than Axel, making it 120 gold pesos.

Together, they have 100 silver pesos and 200 gold pesos, summing up to 300 silver and 200 gold pesos.

Converting silver pesos to their value, 300 silver pesos equal \$3,000, and 200 gold pesos are worth \$20,000, totaling \$23,000.

Adding this to their paper money, the combined total is \$23,000 plus \$130, which equals \$23,130.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together.

1. **Axel's Pesos:**
   - **Silver Pesos:** 50
   - **Gold Pesos:** 80

   **Total:** \(50 + 80 = 130\) pesos

2. **Anna's Pesos:**
   - According to the problem, Anna has **twice as many silver pesos** as Axel and **40 more gold pesos** than Axel.
   
   - **Silver Pesos:** \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - **Gold Pesos:** \(80 + 40 = 120\)

   **Total:** \(100 + 120 = 220\) pesos

3. **Combined Total:**
   - **Silver Pesos:** \(50 + 100 = 150\)
   - **Gold Pesos:** \(80 + 120 = 200\)
   
   **Total Pesos:** \(150 + 200 = 350\) silver and gold pesos.

If we consider the value of silver and gold pesos in their respective monetary values (assuming 1 silver peso = \$1 and 1 gold peso = \$20):

- **Silver Pesos Value:** \(150 \times 1 = \$150\)
- **Gold Pesos Value:** \(200 \times 20 = \$4,000\)

**Total Value Together:** \$150 + \$4,000 = \$4,150

However, if we only consider the total number of pesos without their value, the combined total is:

\[50 + 80 + 100 + 120 = 350\ \text{pesos}\]

But since the problem mentions "the total number of pesos," it likely refers to the count of each type of coin, not their monetary value.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{350}\)
