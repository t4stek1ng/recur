Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Bera-Jarque test and the distribution under the null hypothesis. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is D: skewness of one and kurtosis of three. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I know regarding the Bera-Jarque test.

First off, I recall that the Bera-Jarque test is used to detect the presence of skewness and excess kurtosis in a data set. It's a two-tailed test where the null hypothesis is that the data comes from a normally distributed distribution, and the alternative hypothesis is that there's either a skewness or kurtosis or both.

So, under the null hypothesis, the distribution should have zero skewness and zero kurtosis, right? That makes sense because a normal distribution is symmetric and has no excess kurtosis; it's just a standard bell curve. So, if the data is normally distributed, skewness (which measures asymmetry) and kurtosis (which measures the "tailedness") should both be zero.

But wait, the question is phrased as, "Under the null hypothesis of a Bera-Jarque test, the distribution has..." So, the null hypothesis is that the distribution is normal. But then, the options are giving combinations of skewness and kurtosis. So, is the question asking about the properties of the distribution under the null hypothesis? Or is it referring to some kind of transformation or something else?

Hold on, maybe I should think about how the Bera-Jarque test works. It involves transforming the data. Let me remember. The Bera-Jarque test uses the idea that if the data is normal, then certain transformations should lead to a chi-squared distribution. Specifically, the test applies a transformation to the data to assess both skewness and kurtosis.

I think the transformation involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to standardize the data, and then applying a function that captures both skewness and kurtosis. Maybe something like taking the logarithm or some other function? Hmm, not exactly sure. Wait, perhaps it's about the Jarque-Bera score.

Yes, the Jarque-Bera statistic is used in the Bera-Jarque test. The statistic is calculated as ( (max - min)(n - 1) )^{-1/2} times the sum of ( (X_i - mean)^2 - standard deviation squared )^{3/2} for each observation. This combines a test for kurtosis with a test for skewness.

Hold on, maybe it's about the test statistic's distribution should think about how the Bera-Jarque test works. It involves transforming the data. Let me try to recall the formula for the Jarque-Bera statistic. The Bera-Jarque test uses the idea that if the data is normal, then certain transformations should lead to a chi-squared distribution. Specifically, the test applies a transformation to the data to assess both skewness and kurtosis.
