Okay, so I need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed for 9 kids and 6 adults having smores. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores. Hmm, okay, so each sleeve can make 8 smores. Now, how many sleeves are in a box? It says there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, each box has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores. That means each box can make 3 times 8 smores. Let me calculate that: 3 x 8 = 24 smores per box. So, one box can make 24 smores.

Now, let's figure out how many smores all the kids and adults will eat. There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 smores. So, 9 kids x 2 smores each = 18 smores for the kids. Then, there are 6 adults, and each adult will eat 1 s'more. So, 6 adults x 1 s'more each = 6 smores for the adults. Adding those together, total smores needed are 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Wait a minute, so the total number of smores needed is 24, and each box can make 24 smores. So, that would mean they need exactly 1 box, right? That makes sense because the kids and adults together want exactly the amount that one box can provide. So, 1 box is the correct answer.

But let me just double-check my calculations to be sure. Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, 3 x 8 = 24. The kids need 9 x 2 = 18, and adults need 6 x 1 = 6. 18 + 6 = 24. Yep, that's correct. So, 24 smores needed, and each box gives 24, so 1 box is sufficient. They don't need more than that because 24 is exactly the number needed.

Is there a chance I could have misread the problem? Let me check again. Each sleeve makes 8 smores, 3 sleeves per box. 9 kids, 2 each, 6 adults, 1 each. Total smores: 18 + 6 = 24. Yes, that seems right. So, 24 smores needed, 24 per box. So, 1 box is the correct answer. I think that is solid.

Alternatively, someone might think, what if they need more? But no, the numbers match up perfectly. So, it's not like we need 2 boxes or 3 boxes because 24 is exactly what one box can supply. So, no need for extra boxes, which makes the answer 1 box.

Wait, another thought. Is it possible that each box contains 3 sleeves, but maybe there's some waste or something? But the problem doesn't mention anything about waste or extra needed. It's just asking for how many boxes they need to have enough. So, since 24 is exactly what they need, and each box can supply 24, it's just 1 box. So, that should do it.

I was also thinking, sometimes with these problems, they can trick you by changing numbers or making you think in terms of people per box or something, but in this case, it seems straightforward. It tells us the conversion from sleeves to smores, and the number of people and how much each eats. So, just converting each part step by step.

So, to recap: each box has 3 sleeves, each sleeve can make 8 smores, so 3x8=24 smores per box. The kids need 9x2=18 smores, adults need 6x1=6 smores. Total is 18+6=24. So, 24 smores needed, 24 per box, so 1 box. That makes sense. I don't see a reason to think otherwise.

Therefore, the answer is 1 box.

**Final Answer**
The number of boxes needed is \boxed{1}.
</think>

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. There are 3 sleeves in a box, so each box can make:
\[ 3 \text{ sleeves} \times 8 \text{ smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

The total number of smores needed is calculated as follows:
- 9 kids each wanting 2 smores: 
  \[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]
- 6 adults each wanting 1 s'more:
  \[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ s'more per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Since each box can make 24 smores, they need:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{24 \text{ smores per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Thus, the number of boxes needed is \boxed{1}.

Alright, let me try to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers the kids and adults will need. Hmm, okay, so each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores. There are 3 sleeves in a box. I need to calculate the total number of smores required for all the kids and adults and then see how many boxes are needed.

First, let me break down the information:

- Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
- 3 sleeves are in a box.
- 9 kids each want 2 smores.
- 6 adults will eat 1 smore each.

So, starting with the kids. If each kid wants 2 smores, then 9 kids would need 9 multiplied by 2 smores. Let me do that multiplication: 9 times 2 equals 18 smores for the kids.

Now, moving on to the adults. There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore. So, 6 adults would need 6 smores.

To find the total number of smores needed, I should add the smores for kids and adults together. That's 18 smores plus 6 smores, which equals 24 smores in total.

Okay, now I need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. Since each box has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores, I should first find out how many smores are in a box.

Each box has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, 3 sleeves times 8 smores per sleeve equals 24 smores per box. Hmm, that's interesting. So each box can make 24 smores.

Wait a second, that would mean each box makes exactly the amount needed for 24 smores. Since the total number of smores needed is also 24, then they would only need 1 box.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 9 kids with 2 smores each: 9*2=18. 6 adults with 1 smore each: 6*1=6. 18+6=24 smores. Each box has 3 sleeves, each sleeve makes 8 smores: 3*8=24. So, yeah, 24 smores needed, and each box can make 24 smores. Therefore, 1 box is sufficient.

Is there a chance that I misread the question? Let me see. It says "Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores." So, each sleeve is for 8 smores. "There are 3 sleeves in a box." So, yeah, 3 sleeves per box, each makes 8 smores, so 24 per box.

Total needed: 24. So, 24 divided by 24 is 1 box. No need for any extra boxes because 1 box is exactly enough.

Wait, but maybe I should consider if the smores require more than just the graham crackers. Do they need marshmallows and chocolate as well? Hmm, but the question only mentions the graham crackers, so maybe we don't need to factor in the other parts. It just says the base for smores, so maybe the base is the graham crackers. So, that's the only component we need to calculate.

Therefore, considering only the graham crackers, each smore needs one base, which is a sleeve. So, each smore requires one sleeve, and each sleeve makes 8 smores. Therefore, each box with 3 sleeves makes 24 smores.

So, with 24 smores needed, 1 box is enough.

I think that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 1 box.

**Final Answer**
They will need \boxed{1} box of graham crackers.
</think>

First, we calculate the number of smores needed for the kids and adults separately:

- 9 kids each want 2 smores: 
  \[
  9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
  \]

- 6 adults will each eat 1 smore:
  \[
  6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:
  \[
  18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
  \]

Next, we determine how many boxes are required. Each box contains 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores:
  \[
  3 \text{ sleeves} \times 8 \text{ smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores per box}
  \]

Since 24 smores are needed and each box can make 24 smores, they will need 1 box.

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Okay, so I need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers the group will need. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. I know that a box has 3 sleeves, so I should calculate how many smores one box can make. 

Let me write that down: Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, 1 box = 3 sleeves * 8 smores per sleeve. That would be 24 smores per box. Okay, so one box can make 24 smores.

Now, let's figure out how many smores the kids and adults will eat. 

There are 9 kids who want 2 smores each. So, 9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores for the kids.

Then, there are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore each. So, 6 adults * 1 smore = 6 smores for the adults.

Adding those together, total smores needed are 18 (kids) + 6 (adults) = 24 smores.

Wait a minute, that's exactly the same as one box can make. So, they need 24 smores, and one box provides 24 smores. That must mean they only need 1 box.

Hmm, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Each sleeve is 8 smores, 3 sleeves make 24. Each kid has 2, so 9*2 is 18. Each adult has 1, so 6*1 is 6. 18+6 is 24. Yep, that adds up. So, 24 smores needed, and one box makes 24. Therefore, they need 1 box.

I don't think I missed anything here. It seems straightforward: calculating total smores required and then seeing how many boxes are needed based on how many smores each box makes.

So, the correct answer is 1 box.
</think>

To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of smores each box can make:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box.
   - Therefore, one box makes \(3 \text{ sleeves} \times 8 \text{ smores/sleeve} = 24 \text{ smores}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - 9 kids each wanting 2 smores: \(9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} = 18 \text{ smores}\).
   - 6 adults each wanting 1 smore: \(6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore/adult} = 6 \text{ smores}\).
   - Total smores needed: \(18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}\).

3. **Determine the number of boxes required:**
   - Each box makes 24 smores.
   - Total smores needed are also 24.
   - Therefore, they need \( \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{24 \text{ smores/box}} = 1 \text{ box}\).

**Answer:** 1 box of graham crackers is needed.
