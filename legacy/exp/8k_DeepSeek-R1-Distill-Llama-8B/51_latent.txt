Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Louis De Broglie's hypothesis. The question is asking which constant relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle. The options are Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, Rydberg constant, or the speed of light. The correct answer is supposed to be D, the speed of light. Hmm, I need to figure out why that is.

First, I remember that De Broglie proposed that every particle, like an electron or a proton, has a wavelength associated with it. This is known as the wave-particle duality. The formula he came up with is something like momentum equals h over wavelength. So, mathematically, it's p = h / λ, where p is momentum, h is Planck's constant, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, so if that's the case, then the relationship is directly between momentum and wavelength with Planck's constant. But the question is asking which constant is involved in relating them. So, according to this, Planck's constant is the key here. So why is the correct answer the speed of light?

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. De Broglie's equation is p = h / λ. So, if we rearrange that, we get λ = h / p. So, the wavelength is Planck's constant divided by momentum. But the question is asking which constant relates momentum and wavelength—that is, it's the bridge between them.

Momentum, maybe in natural units where c = 1. Let me think about the units. De Broglie's equation is p = h / λ. So, if we rearrange that, we get λ = h / p. So, the wavelength is Planck's constant divided by momentum. But the question is asking which constant relates momentum and wavelength—that is, it's the bridge between them.

Then, maybe I'm forgetting that in some formulations. Let me think about why the speed of light might be the correct answer. De Broglie's equation is p = h / λ. So, if we rearrange that, we get λ = h / p. So, the wavelength is Planck's constant divided by momentum. But the question is asking which constant relates momentum and wavelength—that is, it's the bridge between them.
