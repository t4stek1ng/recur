<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>A nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day? Why the correct answer is 28?<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a nurses’ station ordering bandages, and I need to figure out how many bandages they started with on the first day. The answer is supposed to be 28, but I want to understand why. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again and list out all the information given:

- They order bandages in bulk packs of 50.
- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack.
- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs and used half a pack.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, the goal is to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day. Let's denote the number of bandages they started with as \( x \).

Wait, actually, hold on. They started with some number of bandages, but they also ordered more on the first and third days. So, the initial stock isn't just \( x \), but they also have the bandages they ordered. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the total number of bandages they have, including what they ordered each day.

Let me think about each day separately.

**First Day:**
- Used 38 bandages.
- Ordered 1 bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.

So, at the end of the first day, they have:

Bandages used: 38
Bandages remaining: \( x - 38 \)
But they also ordered 50 new bandages, so total bandages at the end of day 1: \( (x - 38) + 50 = x + 12 \)

Wait, so they started with \( x \) bandages, used 38, so they have \( x - 38 \) left, then they ordered 50, so in total, they have \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages at the end of day 1.

**Second Day:**
- They used ten fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- They didn't order any bandages on the second day, right? Wait, no, the problem says they only ordered on the first and third days. So, on the second day, they just used 28 bandages.

Therefore, at the end of the second day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x + 12) - 28 = x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \)

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \( 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \) bandages.

So, at the end of the third day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x - 16 - 25 + 100 = x + 59 \)

Wait, so they started with \( x \) bandages, used 38, so they have \( x - 38 \) left, then they ordered 50, so in total, they have \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages at the end of day 1.

**Second Day:**
- They used ten fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- They didn't order any bandages on the second day, right? Wait, no, the problem says they only ordered on the first and third days. So, on the second day, they just used 28 bandages.

Therefore, at the end of the second day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x + 12) - 28 = x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \)

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \( 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \) bandages.

So, at the end of the third day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x - 16 - 25 + 100 = x + 59 \)

First, so they started with \( x \) bandages, used 38, so they have \( x - 38 \) left, then they ordered 50, so in total, they have \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages at the end of day 1.

**Second Day:**
- They used ten fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- They didn't order any bandages on the second day, right? Wait, no, the problem says they only ordered on the first and third days. So, on the second day, they just used 28 bandages.

However, at the end of the second day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x + 12) - 28 = x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \)

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \( 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \) bandages.

So, at the end of the third day, they have:

Bandages remaining: \( (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x - 16 - 25 + 100 = x + 59 \)
