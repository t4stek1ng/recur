Okay, so I have this question about the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. Hmm, let me see. The question is about what happens when light of variable frequency shines on a metal surface of a photoelectric tube. The options are about the work function, current, and potential difference related to frequency or wavelength.

First, I need to recall Einstein's photoelectric equation. From what I remember, the equation is:

\( \phi = hf - \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)

Where \( \phi \) is the work function of the metal, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( f \) is the frequency of the light, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, and \( v \) is the velocity of the emitted electron.

So, the equation relates the work function to the frequency of the light above the threshold frequency. That makes me think that the work function is proportional to the frequency, right? Because if you rearrange the equation, you get \( \phi = hf - \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), but when the light is above the threshold, the kinetic energy \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \) becomes a constant, so \( \phi = hf \). So, \( \phi \) is proportional to \( f \).

Looking at the options, option A says the work function is proportional to the frequency, which seems correct based on my notes. But the question says why the correct answer is C, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "The options are: A. work function... B. work function... C. current... D. potential difference necessary..." So, the question is giving four options, and it's asking why the correct answer is C.

But why is C the correct answer? Let me think about the current in the tube. In the photoelectric effect, when the light frequency is above the threshold, electrons are emitted from the metal surface with kinetic energy. These electrons then move through the tube towards the anode, creating a current.

So, the current depends on the number of electrons emitted per second and their velocity. If the frequency increases, more photons hit the surface, potentially emitting more electrons. So, the current might increase with frequency. But the question is about the relationship between the current and wavelength.

Earlier why is C the correct answer? Let me use different notation about the current in the tube. In the photoelectric effect, when the light frequency is above the threshold, electrons are emitted from the metal surface with kinetic energy. These electrons then move through the tube towards the anode, creating a current.

So, the current depends on the number of electrons emitted per second and their velocity. If the frequency increases, more photons hit the surface, potentially emitting more electrons. So, the current might increase with frequency. But the question is about the relationship between the current and wavelength.
