<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: A researcher tests for structural stability in the following regression model:

$y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_{2t} + \beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t$

The total sample of 200 observations is split exactly in half for the sub-sample regressions. Which would be the unrestricted residual sum of squares?. The options are: A. The RSS for the whole sample, B. The RSS for the first sub-sample, C. The RSS for the second sub-sample, D. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples. Why the correct answer is A.

Okay, so I've got this question about regression analysis, specifically about residual sum of squares (RSS). Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll go step by step.

First, the model given is:

$y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_{2t} + \beta_3 x_{3t} + u_t$

It's a simple linear regression model with three predictors, right? So, we have three independent variables, $x_{2t}$, $x_{3t}$, and the intercept $\beta_1$. The error term is $u_t$.

The total sample is 200 observations, which is split exactly in half. So, each sub-sample has 100 observations. The question is asking about the unrestricted residual sum of squares (RSS). The options are:

A. The RSS for the whole sample.

B. The RSS for the first sub-sample.

C. The RSS for the second sub-sample.

D. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples.

The correct answer is supposed to be A, the RSS for the whole sample. Hmm, why is that?

Let me recall what RSS is. RSS is the sum of the squared residuals, which is the difference between the actual value and the predicted value for each observation. It's used to measure the dispersion of the data points around the regression line.

In the context of regression analysis, when we split the data into sub-samples, we can estimate the model separately for each sub-sample. Each sub-sample will have its own estimated regression coefficients, right? So, each sub-sample will have its own RSS.

But wait, the question is about the "unrestricted" residual sum of squares. I think "unrestricted" here means that we're not imposing any restrictions on the model—so, it's the standard OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimation without any constraints.

Now, if we split the sample into two equal parts, each with 100 observations, and compute the RSS for each part, what would that represent? Each RSS is the sum of squared errors for that particular sub-sample.

But why would the RSS for the whole sample be the correct answer? Let me think.

In the whole sample, we have 200 observations. If we compute the RSS for the entire dataset, that's just the sum of the squared residuals for all 200 observations. But if we split the data into two halves, why would the RSS for the whole sample be equal to the sum of the RSS for the two halves?

So why would the RSS for the whole sample be the correct answer? Let me consider that.

In the whole sample, we have 200 observations. If we compute the RSS for the entire dataset, that's just the sum of the squared residuals for all 200 observations. But if we split the data into two halves, why would the RSS for the whole sample be equal to the sum of the RSS for the two halves?

Alright why would the RSS for the whole sample be the correct answer? Let me write it down.

In the whole sample, we have 200 observations. If we compute the RSS for the entire dataset, that's just the sum of the squared residuals for all 200 observations. But if we split the data into two halves, why would the RSS for the whole sample be equal to the sum of the RSS for the two halves?
