Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about different ways to represent numbers using 8-bit words, and I need to figure out in which of these representations the addition of 109 and -42 stays within range. The options are One's complement, Two's complement, and Sign and magnitude. The answer is supposed to be B, which is II only, meaning only Two's complement works. Hmm, let me try to understand why that is.

First, I need to recall what each of these representations is. So, let's start by breaking down each term.

**1. One's complement:**
I remember that One's complement is a method to represent negative numbers in binary. The way it works is by taking the complement of all the bits of the number. The complement is found by flipping each bit (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) and then adding 1. This effectively gives the negative of the number in two's complement form. However, One's complement alone doesn't allow for easy addition because the addition of two numbers in One's complement requires handling carries differently. Also, One's complement is more of a subtraction method rather than an addition method because it's related to two's complement.

Wait, actually, thinking again, to add two numbers in One's complement, you would still have to manage the carry-out bits, but the key point is that in One's complement, the range is limited. Each number, whether positive or negative, is represented as a one's complement. But in terms of addition, the result might not wrap around correctly or might not be within a standard range like in two's complement.

**2. Two's complement:**
Two's complement is similar to One's complement but with an added step. After taking the One's complement of a number, you add 1 to get the two's complement. This allows two's complement to not only represent negative numbers but also to have a fixed range. Specifically, for an 8-bit number, the two's complement can represent numbers from -128 to 127. This is because the most significant bit (MSB) acts as the sign bit, where 0 is positive and 1 is negative. Adding two numbers in two's complement allows the carry to propagate correctly, and when you add beyond the maximum positive value, it wraps around to the minimum negative value, and vice versa.

So, if we're adding 109 and -42, we should check if their sum is within the two's complement range.

**3. Sign and magnitude:**
Sign and magnitude is another method of representing numbers, where the number is split into its sign (either positive or negative) and its magnitude (the absolute value). In this case, when adding numbers, you would add their magnitudes and then adjust the sign based on the original numbers. For example, adding 109 (positive) and -42 (negative), you would add 109 + 42 = 151, and then the sign would be negative because one of the numbers is negative. But wait, is this correct? Or does the sign and magnitude method consider the direction of the numbers differently?

Wait, no. Actually, in sign and magnitude, the sign is separate from the magnitude. So when adding two numbers, you add their magnitudes and then set the sign based on whether the original numbers had a positive or negative sign. So in this case, since one is positive and one is negative, the result would be negative. But the magnitude would be 109 + 42 = 151. Therefore, the number would be -151.

Alternatively, no. Actually, in sign and magnitude, the sign is separate from the magnitude. So when adding two numbers, you add their magnitudes and then set the sign based on whether the original numbers had a positive or negative sign. So in this case, since one is positive and one is negative, the result would be negative. But the magnitude would be 109 + 42 = 151. Therefore, the number would be -151.

So, no. Actually, in sign and magnitude, the sign is separate from the magnitude. So when adding two numbers, you add their magnitudes and then set the sign based on whether the original numbers had a positive or negative sign. So in this case, since one is positive and one is negative, the result would be negative. But the magnitude would be 109 + 42 = 151. Therefore, the number would be -151.
