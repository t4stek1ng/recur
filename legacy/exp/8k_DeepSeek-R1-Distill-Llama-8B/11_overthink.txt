[overthinking]
First, identify the weekly production amounts based on the given information.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.

In the second week, he produces half of the first week's production, which is 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times the first week's production, amounting to 24,000 bars.

Next, calculate the total production over the first three weeks:

8,000 (Week 1) + 4,000 (Week 2) + 24,000 (Week 3) = 36,000 bars.

Determine the fourth week's production by dividing the total production by 3:

36,000 ÷ 3 = 12,000 bars.

However, this calculation leads to an inconsistency because the total production for the first three weeks is 36,000 bars, and dividing by 3 would imply the fourth week's production is 12,000 bars. But since the total production is actually 50,000 bars, the correct approach is to find the difference between 50,000 and 36,000, which is 14,000 bars. This 14,000 bars must be produced in the fourth week to reach the total monthly production of 50,000 bars.

Let's break down Boris's chocolate production over the four weeks to determine how much he produces in the fourth week.

1. **First Week's Production:**
   - Boris produces **8,000 bars** in the first week.

2. **Second Week's Production:**
   - He produces **half** of the first week's production.
   - \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.

3. **Third Week's Production:**
   - He produces **three times** the first week's production.
   - \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars.

4. **Total Production in the First Three Weeks:**
   - \( 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \) bars.

5. **Fourth Week's Production:**
   - Boris's total monthly production is **50,000 bars**.
   - The production in the first three weeks is **36,000 bars**.
   - To find the fourth week's production:
     \[
     50,000 \text{ total} - 36,000 \text{ (first three weeks)} = 14,000 \text{ bars (fourth week)}
     \]

However, there seems to be a confusion in the reasoning. Let's clarify:

- If Boris's **average weekly production** over the four weeks is:
  \[
  \frac{50,000}{4} = 12,500 \text{ bars per week}
  \]
  
- **This suggests** that the fourth week's production should be **12,500 bars** to reach the total monthly production of **50,000 bars**.

But based on the provided numbers, the correct answer should be **12,500 bars**.

\[
\boxed{12000}
\]
