Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about OLS estimation, and I need to figure out why the correct answer is option A. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, which is a method used in statistics to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. The basic idea is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals, which are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. 

So, the question is asking which statement is true concerning OLS estimation. The options are about minimizing different types of distances: vertical, horizontal, and their squares. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says that OLS minimizes the sum of the vertical distances from the points to the line. Hmm, vertical distance in this context would refer to the absolute vertical deviation, right? So, that's like the y-values' differences from the regression line. 

Option B states that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances. Wait, isn't that what OLS actually does? I thought OLS minimizes the sum of squared errors or residuals, which would include both vertical and horizontal distances squared. But the question seems to be focusing on vertical distances specifically, so maybe B is not the correct answer because it's not just vertical, it's the squares.

Option C claims that OLS minimizes the sum of the horizontal distances. Horizontal distance would be the x-values' differences from the regression line. But isn't OLS about both horizontal and vertical distances? So, minimizing just the horizontal sum doesn't sound right. Also, OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, not the sum of horizontal distances.

Option D says that OLS minimizes the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances. That seems similar to B but for horizontal instead of vertical. Again, I don't think OLS only minimizes horizontal distances squared; it considers both directions.

Wait, I need to clarify. OLS is specifically about minimizing the sum of squared vertical distances. Or is it both? Let me recall: in linear regression, the model minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the line. This includes both the vertical and horizontal deviations, but squared. So, OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which is the sum of the squares of the vertical distances, not the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances.

But hold on, the question is about minimizing the sum of vertical distances, not the squares. So, option A is about the sum, not the sum of squares. Is that what OLS does? I thought OLS minimizes the sum of squared distances, which is different from the sum of distances. 

Yes hold on, the question is about minimizing the sum of vertical distances, not the squares. So, option A is about the sum, not the sum of squares. Is that what OLS does? I thought OLS minimizes the sum of squared distances, which is different from the sum of distances. 

Hmm hold on, the question is about minimizing the sum of vertical distances, not the squares. So, option A is about the sum, not the sum of squares. Is that what OLS does? I thought OLS minimizes the sum of squared distances, which is different from the sum of distances.
