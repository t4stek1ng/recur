Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It says that bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. The question is about the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 2. And it's mentioned that the correct answer is a doublet of doublets, but I need to figure out why.

First, let me try to visualize the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a norbornane-like structure, but actually, it's a more rigid structure with three bridges each of two carbons. So, it's like two rings connected together with three bridges. The "octan-2-one" part means there's a ketone group at carbon 2.

Now, when this compound is irradiated with UV light, it probably undergoes some kind of photochemical reaction. I remember that ketones can undergo Norrish Type I or II reactions upon irradiation. Let me recall: Norrish Type I is cleavage of the carbonyl group, producing two radicals that can recombine or form other products. Norrish Type II involves hydrogen abstraction from an alpha carbon, leading to the formation of a conjugated diradical, which can rearrange.

In bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the ketone. So, the carbons adjacent to carbon 2 are the bridgehead carbons. Let me think, in a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridge is two carbons, so the structure is like a cube with three bridges, each of two carbons. Carbon 2 is one of the bridgehead carbons, so it's connected to three other carbons. The structure is quite rigid.

When the ketone is irradiated, it can undergo either Norrish I or Norrish II. Let me consider both possibilities. Norrish I would cleave the ketone into two fragments, but given the bridge structure, maybe that's not feasible because the molecule is too rigid. Alternatively, Norrish II would involve hydrogen abstraction from an alpha position, leading to a diradical.

Wait, but wait. In bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, the alpha carbons are the bridgehead carbons. So, if a hydrogen is abstracted from one of them, we get a diradical. But where does that lead? Maybe a ring opening? Alternatively, maybe an electrocyclic ring opening or something else.

But the product 1 has the same molecular weight as the starting material. So, it can't be a ring opening that leads to a straight chain, because that would change molecular weight. Wait, no, the molecular weight is the same, so it's probably a rearrangement without losing any atoms.

Another possibility is a retro-aldol reaction, but that's not under UV. Or maybe it's a [2+2] photocycloaddition. Hmm. Wait, or perhaps a [1,3]-shift or some kind of hydride shift.

Alright the product 1 has the same molecular weight as the starting material. So, it can't be a ring opening that leads to a straight chain, because that would change molecular weight. Wait, no, the molecular weight is the same, so it's probably a rearrangement without losing any atoms.

Well the product 1 has the same molecular weight as the starting material. So, it can't be a ring opening that leads to a straight chain, because that would change molecular weight. Wait, no, the molecular weight is the same, so it's probably a rearrangement without losing any atoms.
