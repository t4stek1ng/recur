[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product is the strongest evidence for a β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism. Let me break this down step by step.

First, what's happening in the reaction? The dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. That means it's a protected peptide with a phenylalanine (Phe) linked to an alanine derivative where the side chain on the β-carbon is an azido group (-N3). The reaction involves substituting the azido group with a nucleophilic base, specifically attacking the β-carbon.

The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. Let me recall what those steps involve. β-elimination usually involves the removal of a small group (like a leaving group) along with a hydrogen, forming a double bond. In this case, the azido group is a good leaving group because it's substituted with a nitrogen, which can leave as N3- after some assistance, perhaps from a base. So, when the azido group is eliminated, it would form an imine or some sort of nitrile intermediate? Wait, or maybe a keto group because the azide is attached to the β-carbon. So, the elimination would form a double bond between the α and β carbons, creating an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system. That makes sense because Phe is already part of a peptide, so the carbonyl is from the peptide bond.

Once the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is formed, the nucleophile can perform a Michael addition, which is a conjugate addition. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated system because it's more electrophilic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. So, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, forming a new single bond, and thus replaces the azido group.

Now, why does the optical rotation change? Optical rotation is a property that arises from the chiral centers in a molecule. Each chiral center contributes to the overall rotation. In the starting dipeptide, the alanine residue has an azido group on its β-carbon. But wait, in alanine, the β-carbon is the chiral center (the α-carbon is attached to the amino group, the β-carbon to the side chain, and so on). However, in this case, the azido group is on the β-carbon of alanine. Does that change the configuration?

Wait, alanine's structure: the α-carbon is the central chiral carbon. The side chain is on the β-carbon, but the configuration at the α-carbon is determined by the substituents around it. So, if the β-carbon has an azido group, that's a substituent, but it's on the next carbon. So, does the presence of the azido group affect the configuration at the α-carbon? Hmm.

Alternatively, if the β-elimination occurs, the α and β carbons become conjugated, forming a double bond. This process might change the stereochemistry because the elimination could lead to either retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the mechanism. But wait, β-elimination is often an E2 mechanism, which involves a concerted process with a hydrogen and the leaving group leaving, leading to the formation of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the double bond depends on the geometry of the starting material. So, if the starting material has an R or S configuration at the α-carbon, after elimination, the double bond will have a certain geometry (E or Z), which in turn affects the planar structure around the double bond.

However, the Michael addition step would then add a new nucleophile across this conjugated system. The addition could be either syn or anti, depending on the mechanism. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, and the proton might come from the α-carbon or elsewhere. So, the stereochemistry of the addition could lead to a new chiral center or affect the existing one.

Wait, but in the starting dipeptide, the alanine's β-carbon has an azido group. So, when the nucleophile replaces the azido group, it's adding to the same β-carbon. But in the process, the stereochemistry at the α-carbon might change if the elimination and addition steps cause some inversion or retention.

In the original molecule, the configuration at the α-carbon of alanine (let's say it's L-alanine, so the α-carbon is R configuration). After elimination, the double bond forms, and during the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon in a way that could either retain or invert the configuration. But wait, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is planar after elimination. So, the addition could lead to a new stereocenter at the β-carbon, but the α-carbon remains as the chiral center.

Wait, no. The β-elimination leads to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, and the Michael addition adds to the β-carbon, which was previously attached to the azido group. If the nucleophile adds in a way that affects the configuration at the α-carbon, maybe there's some stereochemical change.

But perhaps the key point is that during the β-elimination, the original chiral center (at the α-carbon) is transformed into a double bond, which is planar, losing the stereochemistry. Then, during the Michael addition, a new stereocenter is formed at the β-carbon, which may or may not have the same configuration as before.

Wait, but in the starting material, the azido group is on the β-carbon. So, when it's eliminated, the α-carbon's chiral center is involved in the elimination. Let me sketch this out mentally.

The alanine residue is:

NH2-CH(R)-CO-NH-Ome, where R is the side chain. Wait, no, in alanine, the structure is CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH. But in this case, the alanine is modified as Ala(3-N3), meaning the side chain is azido. So, the structure is CH3-CH(NH2)-CO-NH-Phe-Ome, but the side chain is on the β-carbon, which is the CH2 in alanine normally. So, the β-carbon has an azido group attached.

Wait, no, in alanine, the side chain is on the β-carbon. So, the structure is CH2(NH2)-CH(R)-COOH, but here R is the azido group. So, the β-carbon is attached to the azido group.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: in amino acids, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino group (NH2) and the carboxyl group (in the peptide bond). The β-carbon is the next one, so in alanine, the structure is NH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the β-carbon is the CH3 group.

In this case, it's modified as Ala(3-N3), so the β-carbon has an azido group (-N3) instead of a methyl group. So, the structure is NH2-CH(azido)-COOH. So, the azido group is directly attached to the β-carbon.

So, when β-elimination occurs, the azido group is eliminated, along with a hydrogen from the α-carbon, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This would convert the structure into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system, specifically an α,β-unsaturated amide.

The elimination step would result in a double bond, which is planar. Then, the nucleophile (base) would perform a Michael addition, adding to the β-carbon. The addition could be either from the top or bottom face, leading to different configurations at the β-carbon.

But how does this affect the optical rotation? The starting dipeptide has a certain configuration at the α-carbon of alanine (R or S, depending on the specific amino acid). After elimination and addition, the configuration at the α-carbon might remain the same, but a new chiral center is formed at the β-carbon.

Wait, but in the starting dipeptide, the β-carbon is a chiral center because it has four different substituents: the α-carbon (which is the chiral center), the azido group, a hydrogen, and a peptide bond. So, the β-carbon is also a chiral center. After elimination, the β-carbon becomes part of the double bond, so it's no longer a chiral center. Then, during the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, forming a new single bond, thus re-creating a chiral center there.

The configuration at the new β-carbon could be R or S, depending on the addition's stereochemistry. If the addition is stereospecific, the product would have a different configuration than the starting material, leading to a change in optical rotation.

But in the question, it's stated that the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon, so the product would have the nucleophile attached there, replacing the azido group.

So, if the mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon is altered because the addition can occur from either face of the planar double bond. This would change the configuration, leading to a different optical rotation.

In contrast, if the substitution were a simple SN2 reaction, the configuration at the β-carbon would invert, but since it's a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition, the configuration might not just be a simple inversion but could involve a change in configuration due to the formation of a double bond and then a new chiral center.

Wait, no. In SN2 substitution, the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side, leading to inversion. But in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is conjugated with the carbonyl group. The addition can proceed with either syn or anti addition. If it's a conjugate addition, the stereochemistry of the addition depends on the approach of the nucleophile.

In the case of a β-elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, the double bond's geometry (E or Z) would influence the approach of the nucleophile. If the double bond is E, the nucleophile might approach from one face, whereas for Z, it might approach from the opposite.

But perhaps the key point is that in the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, creating a new stereocenter. If the addition is stereoselective, the product's configuration will differ from the starting material, leading to a different optical rotation. However, in a simple SN2 substitution, the configuration at the β-carbon would invert, but the α-carbon's configuration remains the same. So, the overall optical rotation would change but perhaps in a different way.

Wait, but in the starting dipeptide, the azido group is on the β-carbon, which is a chiral center. If the nucleophile replaces it via a β-elimination-Michael addition, the new group is added in such a way that the configuration at the β-carbon is determined by the addition's stereochemistry, which could be different from the original.

Alternatively, perhaps the α-carbon's configuration is retained, but the new group's configuration leads to a different overall rotation. Or maybe the process involves a racemization because the elimination step could lead to a loss of stereochemistry, resulting in a mixture of configurations.

Wait, but in the question, it's stated that the product has a different optical rotation. So, the mechanism involves a change in the stereochemistry that affects the overall rotation. If the mechanism were a simple SN2 substitution, the configuration at the β-carbon would invert, but the α-carbon remains. However, in the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism, the process changes the configuration in a way that's different from a simple inversion, perhaps leading to a different optical rotation.

Alternatively, the β-elimination-Michael addition could lead to a new stereocenter with opposite configuration, but I'm not entirely sure. I might need to think about the specific steps.

Let me consider the dipeptide: Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The alanine has the azido group on the β-carbon. When β-elimination occurs, the azido group leaves, and a double bond forms between the α and β carbons. This makes the α-carbon part of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

During the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon from either the top or bottom face, leading to a new stereocenter. If the nucleophile approaches from the opposite face relative to the original substituents, the configuration at the β-carbon would change.

In the starting material, the β-carbon has the azido group in a specific configuration (R or S). After elimination, the β-carbon becomes a double bond, so no chirality there. Then, the nucleophile adds, creating a new chiral center. If the addition is stereoselective, the new group's configuration will differ from the original, leading to a different optical rotation.

In contrast, in a simple substitution (e.g., SN2), the configuration at the β-carbon would invert, but the α-carbon's configuration remains, leading to a different rotation. However, the question is about the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism, so the key is that the process involves a change in the stereochemistry beyond a simple inversion.

But wait, in the starting dipeptide, the β-carbon's configuration is determined by the substituents around it. If the nucleophile adds in a different configuration, the overall molecule's optical rotation would differ.

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism would be that the process leads to a change in the configuration of the molecule, as indicated by the optical rotation, which is a direct result of the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, if the substitution were a simple SN2, the product would have inverted configuration at the β-carbon, leading to a change in rotation. However, the question is why the β-elimination-Michael addition is the likely mechanism, and the difference in rotation supports this.

Wait, perhaps the β-elimination-Michael addition leads to a new stereocenter at the β-carbon that is different from the original, while a substitution would just invert the configuration without creating a new stereocenter. Or maybe the process involves more than just substitution.

Alternatively, in the β-elimination-Michael addition, the α-carbon's configuration might also change, whereas in substitution, it remains the same. So, the overall rotation would differ more significantly.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to summarize:

- Starting dipeptide: Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. Azido group on β-carbon of alanine, which is a chiral center.

- Reaction: Nucleophile replaces azido group at β-carbon.

- Proposed mechanism: β-elimination forms α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, followed by Michael addition, creating a new stereocenter at β-carbon.

- If the mechanism involves a change in stereochemistry, the product's optical rotation would differ from the starting material.

- If the substitution were SN2, the product would have inverted configuration, but the α-carbon's configuration remains, leading to a different rotation.

- However, the question is about the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism, so the evidence would be that the substitution leads to a change in configuration that can't be explained by a simple SN2 mechanism, perhaps involving a planar transition state or loss of stereochemistry followed by addition.

Wait, but in the β-elimination, the α-carbon becomes part of a double bond, so its configuration might change. Then, during Michael addition, a new stereocenter is formed. So, maybe the α-carbon's configuration is altered, leading to a more significant change in rotation.

Alternatively, the β-elimination-Michael addition could lead to a racemic mixture if the addition is not stereoselective, but the question states that the nucleophile forms a bond, implying a single product.

I think the key point is that the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism involves the formation of a planar intermediate (the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl), which allows for the nucleophile to add from either face, leading to a change in configuration. This would result in a different optical rotation compared to the starting material, whereas a simple substitution (like SN2) would only invert the configuration, which might not be as significant in terms of rotation magnitude.

Thus, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is evidence that the mechanism involves a change in stereochemistry that isn't just a simple inversion, but a more complex process involving elimination and addition, leading to a different configuration.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. This change in optical rotation indicates a alteration in the molecule's stereochemistry, which cannot be fully explained by a simple substitution mechanism like SN2. Instead, the β-elimination step forms an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate, which is planar, allowing the nucleophile to add to the β-carbon from either face. This stereoselective addition leads to a new configuration at the β-carbon, resulting in a different optical rotation. This mechanism differs from a simple substitution, where the stereochemistry at the β-carbon would only invert without involving a planar intermediate or a new stereocenter. Therefore, the observed change in optical rotation supports the β-elimination-Michael addition pathway as the likely mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the reaction mechanism involving a dipeptide. Let me start by recalling what I know about β-elimination and Michael addition reactions.

First, β-elimination is a reaction where a leaving group, like a nitro group or something similar, is removed along with a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon, forming a double bond. This often happens in organic molecules to create conjugated systems or to form alkenes.

Michael addition is the reverse process, where a nucleophile attacks a Michael acceptor, which is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile adds across the double bond, typically at the beta position relative to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a new bond.

The question mentions that when treating Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe with a nucleophilic base, the azido group is replaced by the nucleophile, specifically at the β-carbon of the amino acid. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition.

So, the user is asking what evidence would support this mechanism. The given reason is a difference in the magnitude of optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product.

Hmm, optical rotation, or optical activity, refers to the rotation of plane-polarized light by a chiral substance. Each amino acid has a specific configuration (R or S) at its chiral centers. When the azido group is replaced, the configuration at that carbon might change, affecting the overall optical rotation.

Let me think about the mechanism step by step. In β-elimination, the azido group (N3-) would leave, taking a hydrogen from the adjacent α-carbon, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This would create an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is the Michael acceptor.

Then, the nucleophile would perform a Michael addition, attacking the β-carbon of this acceptor, adding across the double bond. Since the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon, the configuration at that carbon might invert or undergo some change.

Wait, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, but depending on the mechanism, the stereochemistry could be affected. For example, in a concerted addition, the nucleophile approaches from the opposite side of the leaving group, leading to inversion of configuration.

But in this case, the leaving group is the azido group, which is on the same carbon as the chiral center. So when it leaves, it might change the configuration at that center. Then, when the nucleophile adds, it could either retain or invert the configuration, depending on the mechanism.

Wait, actually, the azido group is on the β-carbon. So in the starting dipeptide, the Ala(3-N3) has the N3 group on the beta carbon. So when the β-elimination occurs, that's removing the N3 group, forming a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.

So the Ala residue would go from Ala(3-N3) to an α,β-unsaturated Ala derivative. Then, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, adding across the double bond.

Now, considering the stereochemistry, during β-elimination, the hydrogen is abstracted from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of the double bond. The stereochemistry of that elimination would determine the geometry of the double bond.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon from the opposite side of the carbonyl group, following the conjugated system. This could lead to a change in the configuration of the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

But wait, the original azido group is on the beta carbon, which is a chiral center. When it's removed, the double bond is formed, and that carbon becomes part of the double bond. So, the configuration at the original position might not directly affect the product's configuration because it's now a double bond.

But the product is a dipeptide where the Ala has been modified. The nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, which, in the starting material, was the same beta carbon as the azido group. So, the position of addition is at a different carbon, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize the dipeptide structure. Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So, the Ala has a N3 group on its beta carbon (position 3). After β-elimination, that N3 leaves, taking a hydrogen from the alpha carbon (position 2), forming a double bond between C2 and C3.

So, after elimination, we have Boc-Phe-CH2-CH2-OMe with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, the double bond would be between the alpha and beta carbons of the Ala residue, so it would be Boc-Phe-CH2-C=CH-OMe? No, that doesn't make sense because the Ala is at position 3.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Ala has three carbons: alpha (connected to the peptide bond), beta, and gamma. The N3 is on the beta carbon. So, when β-elimination occurs, the N3 leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted from the alpha carbon, leading to a double bond between alpha and beta.

That would convert Ala(3-N3) into an α,β-unsaturated Ala. So, the structure becomes Boc-Phe-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OMe, but with a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. So, Boc-Phe-CH2-C=CH-OMe? No, that's not right. The Ala has three carbons, so the double bond would be between C2 and C3, making it Boc-Phe-CH2-CH2-OMe with a double bond between the middle carbons.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent it as Boc-Phe-CH2-CH2-OMe becoming Boc-Phe-CH2=CH-OMe after elimination. But that's not quite accurate because the N3 is on the beta carbon, so elimination would form a double bond between alpha and beta.

Now, when the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon in the Michael addition, it adds across the double bond. So, the product would have a new substituent on the beta carbon.

In terms of stereochemistry, the original azido group is on the beta carbon, which is a chiral center. After elimination, that carbon becomes part of a double bond, so it's no longer a chiral center. Then, during Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, which was previously part of the double bond.

Wait, but if the double bond is between alpha and beta, then the beta carbon is involved in the double bond and wouldn't have four substituents anymore, so it's not a chiral center. However, when the nucleophile adds, it would add to the beta carbon, which was part of the double bond.

The configuration at the original alpha carbon (where the amino group is attached) might remain unchanged, but the addition at the beta carbon could lead to a new stereocenter.

Wait, but the nucleophile is attacking the beta carbon, which was previously part of the double bond, so it's adding across the double bond. So, the beta carbon in the product would now have a new substituent.

In the starting material, the Ala(3-N3) has a specific configuration (R or S) at the beta carbon. After the reaction, that configuration is gone because it's part of a double bond. But the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, which might create a new stereocenter depending on the geometry of the addition.

So, if the Michael addition is stereoselective, the configuration at the new stereocenter would depend on the mechanism, perhaps leading to an opposite configuration compared to the starting material.

Now, considering optical rotation, each stereocenter contributes to the overall rotation. If the configuration at the beta carbon changes, the product's optical rotation would differ from the starting material.

But wait, in the starting material, the azido group is on the beta carbon. After elimination, that's gone. Then, the nucleophile adds to the same beta carbon, creating a new substituent. So, the product would have a new group at the beta carbon, which might have a different configuration than the starting material.

So, if the mechanism involves a change in configuration (like inversion), then the product would have a different optical rotation. Alternatively, if the configuration remains the same, the rotation might be similar.

But why would the rotation be different? Let me think about the actual process. In β-elimination, the azido group leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted from the adjacent carbon. This forms a double bond, so the configuration at the beta carbon (where the azido group was) is lost because it's now a double bond.

Then, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group (if it's an E2 mechanism for elimination and then a conjugate addition). So, the attack would be from the opposite side, leading to a new substituent with opposite configuration.

Wait, but the original configuration is at the alpha carbon (where the amino group is). So, perhaps the configuration at the beta carbon is not the same as the starting material.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the mechanism involves a change in stereochemistry. If the product has a different configuration at the site of substitution, it would have a different optical rotation.

So, comparing the specific rotation (like [α]) of the starting material and the product, if there's a significant difference, it suggests that the stereochemistry has changed, which would support the proposed mechanism involving a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition, which could alter the configuration.

Alternatively, without a change in configuration, the optical rotation would be similar, suggesting a different mechanism like an SN2 substitution, which doesn't involve such a stereochemical change.

But wait, the nucleophile is a base, so it's likely deprotonating something. In β-elimination, a base might abstract a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of the double bond.

Then, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (base) would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, adding to the beta carbon. Depending on the mechanism (concerted vs. stepwise), the stereochemistry could differ.

In a stepwise mechanism, the addition could involve a planar intermediate, leading to racemization or some loss of stereochemistry. But in a concerted mechanism, the stereochemistry would be retained.

Wait, but the question is about the magnitude of optical rotation. If the configuration changes, the rotation changes. If it doesn't, it stays the same.

But the question says that there's a difference in the magnitude of optical rotation between the starting material and the product. So, this difference would indicate a change in configuration, supporting the idea that the substitution occurred with a change in stereochemistry, which would be consistent with a Michael addition that forms a new stereocenter with opposite configuration.

Alternatively, if the substitution were SN2, the configuration might invert, but since it's a β-elimination, followed by a Michael addition, the stereochemistry could involve more than just inversion.

Wait, but in the case of β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the original configuration at the alpha carbon (where the amino group is attached) might remain the same, but the new substituent added at the beta carbon could have a different configuration.

So, the product would have a new stereocenter at the beta carbon, which wasn't present before. Therefore, the specific rotation would reflect this new stereocenter, leading to a different optical rotation compared to the starting material.

Alternatively, if the mechanism didn't involve a change in configuration, the rotation would be similar, suggesting a different pathway like direct substitution.

Therefore, the difference in optical rotation is strong evidence for the proposed mechanism because it indicates that a stereoselective process occurred, which aligns with the β-elimination followed by Michael addition.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is the observed difference in the magnitude of optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. This change in optical rotation indicates a change in stereochemistry, which aligns with the proposed mechanism.

In the β-elimination step, the azido group on the beta carbon is removed, forming a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. This step eliminates the stereochemistry at the beta carbon, as it becomes part of a double bond. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, creating a new stereocenter. Depending on the mechanism (concerted vs. stepwise), the stereochemistry at this new center can be influenced, potentially leading to a configuration different from the original.

A significant difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product suggests that the reaction involved a stereoselective process, such as the formation of a new stereocenter or a change in the configuration of an existing stereocenter. This is consistent with the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism, as opposed to a non-stereoselective process like a direct substitution reaction, which would not cause such a change in optical rotation.

**Answer:** The difference in optical rotation is strong evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism because it indicates a stereoselective process that alters the stereochemistry of the product, supporting the proposed pathway.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product is the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in this reaction. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the reaction involved. The starting material is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So, this is a dipeptide where the alanine residue has an azido group attached to its β-carbon. The nucleophilic base used in this reaction will replace the azido group by attacking the β-carbon. 

The mechanism proposed is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. β-elimination typically involves the removal of a small molecule, like a leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond. In this case, the azido group is a good leaving group, so the β-elimination step would likely form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Then, the nucleophile would undergo a Michael addition by attacking the β-carbon of this unsaturated carbonyl.

Now, optical rotation, or optical activity, refers to a molecule's ability to rotate plane-polarized light. Different configurations of chiral centers lead to different optical rotations. If the starting dipeptide and the product have the same configuration at the α-carbon of alanine, they might not show a significant difference in optical rotation. However, if the mechanism involves a change in configuration, that would alter the optical rotation.

In the starting material, the alanine residue has an azido group on the β-carbon. The configuration at the α-carbon is L-alanine. If the reaction proceeds through a β-elimination, the azido group is removed, and a double bond forms between the α and β carbons. This would result in a conjugated α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, making the α-carbon a new site for nucleophilic attack.

The nucleophile, perhaps a hydroxide or an amine, would attack the β-carbon in a Michael addition. This addition could occur with either retention or inversion of configuration. If the addition is stereospecific and leads to a different configuration at the α-carbon, the optical rotation would change.

Wait, no, actually, after elimination, the α-carbon becomes part of a double bond, so the configuration at the α-carbon might not directly affect the product. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, so the new bond formed is at the β-position. Therefore, the α-carbon's configuration remains unchanged, but the substitution occurs at the β-carbon. Hmm, but then why would there be a change in optical rotation?

Ah, perhaps the elimination step leads to the formation of a conjugated system, which can influence the electron distribution in the molecule. This might affect the stereochemistry of the Michael addition. If the addition is stereospecific, it could lead to a different stereochemistry at the β-carbon, changing the molecule's overall configuration.

Wait, but the starting material has the azido group on the β-carbon. After elimination, the double bond is between α and β, so the structure becomes an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. Then, when the nucleophile adds, it adds across the double bond, potentially at the β-carbon. If the addition is stereoselective, the configuration at the β-carbon could change.

But how does this relate to optical rotation? The starting material has a certain configuration, and if the product has a different configuration at the β-carbon, the overall molecule's optical rotation would differ. Or, perhaps, the conjugated system affects the molecule's overall shape, leading to a different optical rotation.

Alternatively, maybe the β-elimination step creates a new chiral center or changes the existing one. Wait, no, elimination would remove a leaving group and form a double bond, which is planar, so any stereogenic centers would remain or be transformed.

Wait, let me reconsider. The alanine residue in the starting material is 3-azido-L-alanine. The α-carbon is chiral (as it is L-alanine). After β-elimination, the azide leaves, and a double bond forms between the α and β carbons. So, the α-carbon is now part of a carbonyl group and a double bond, making it a conjugated system. Then, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is part of the double bond. Depending on the mechanism, this attack could be either from the same face (leading to retention) or the opposite face (leading to inversion), affecting the stereochemistry of the β-carbon.

But in this case, the product is a substitution at the β-carbon, so the configuration at the β-carbon would change. If the starting material had an azide group on the β-carbon with a specific configuration, the substitution by the nucleophile would lead to a different configuration, thus altering the molecule's optical rotation.

However, the question specifies that the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon. So, perhaps the starting material has a certain configuration, and after substitution, the configuration at the β-carbon is different, leading to a different optical rotation.

Wait, but in the starting dipeptide, the azide is a substituent on the β-carbon. The configuration of the α-carbon is L, which is a chiral center. If the substitution occurs at the β-carbon, which is not a chiral center in alanine, then maybe the substitution doesn't affect the α-carbon's configuration, but the new bond at the β-carbon could create a new chiral center.

Ah, so if the β-carbon becomes a chiral center after substitution, the product would have a different configuration there compared to the starting material. Since the starting material had an azide on the β-carbon, which is not a chiral center, the configuration of the β-carbon was not chiral. After substitution, it becomes a chiral center, leading to a different optical rotation.

Wait, but in the starting material, the β-carbon is attached to an azide, an CH2 group (from the dipeptide), and two other carbons from the peptide bonds. Is the β-carbon a chiral center in the starting material? Let me think about the structure.

The alanine residue in the dipeptide is Ala(3-N3). So, the structure is:

- α-carbon: attached to NH2 (from the peptide bond), CO (from another peptide bond), CH2 (from the side chain), and the β-carbon.
- β-carbon: attached to N3, CH2, and two carbons from the peptide bonds.

Wait, no, the alanine has an azide group at the β position. So, the β-carbon is connected to the α-carbon, the azide group (N3), a methyl group (from the original alanine's side chain, which is CH3), and another carbon, which is part of the peptide chain.

Wait, no, alanine's structure is CH(NH2)CH(CH3)COOH. In this case, it's modified to Ala(3-N3), meaning the β-carbon (the CH3 in alanine) is replaced with an azide group, so the β-carbon is now connected to N3, the α-carbon, and two other carbons (from the peptide bonds). So, the β-carbon is connected to N3, the α-carbon, a CH2 (from the peptide), and another CH2 (from the peptide). Wait, no, in a peptide, each amino acid is connected via the carboxy and amino groups. So, the β-carbon of alanine is the CH2 group, but in this case, it's replaced with N3.

Wait, no, alanine's structure is:

α: NH2-CH(CH3)-COOH

In the dipeptide, it's Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So, the Ala(3-N3) would have its β-carbon (the CH3 in alanine) replaced with an azide. So, the Ala(3-N3) is:

α: NH-CH2-N3-CO-Ome

Wait, no, that's not right. The β-carbon in alanine is the CH3, but when substituted with N3, it becomes CH2-N3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me draw the alanine structure:

- The α-carbon is the central carbon connected to:
  - NH (from the peptide bond),
  - CO (to the next amino acid),
  - CH3 (side chain),
  - β-carbon (which is the CH3 in alanine).

But in Ala(3-N3), the CH3 is replaced with an azide group. So the β-carbon (originally CH3) is now connected to N3, the α-carbon, and two other groups from the peptide bonds. So the β-carbon would have four substituents: N3, α-C, and two CH2 groups (from the peptide chain). Therefore, the β-carbon becomes a chiral center in the starting material.

Wait, no, in the starting material, the β-carbon is connected to N3, the α-carbon, and two more CH2 groups. If those two CH2 groups are on opposite sides, then the β-carbon would be chiral. But if they're on the same side, it wouldn't be. However, in the dipeptide, the Ala(3-N3) is part of a peptide chain, so the substituents would be arranged in a specific way.

But regardless, after the substitution, the β-carbon is replaced by a nucleophile. If the nucleophile adds in a specific stereoselective manner, it can change the configuration at the β-carbon, making it a new chiral center with a different configuration, thereby changing the optical rotation.

Alternatively, the elimination step could lead to a different configuration at the α-carbon, but I think the substitution is occurring at the β-carbon, so the configuration at the α-carbon remains the same, but the substitution at the β-carbon creates a new chiral center.

So, the key point is that the substitution leads to a change in the configuration either at the β-carbon or possibly elsewhere, which affects the optical rotation. If the mechanism involves a stereospecific addition, the product would have a different optical rotation than the starting material.

Therefore, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is evidence that the substitution occurred with a specific stereochemistry, which would only happen if a stereoselective mechanism like the β-elimination–Michael addition took place. If the substitution were non-stereoselective, the optical rotation might not show a significant difference, especially if multiple stereoisomers are formed. But since there's a difference in optical rotation, it suggests a stereoselective process, which aligns with the proposed mechanism involving a Michael addition (which is stereoselective).

Wait, but optical rotation can also be influenced by the overall structure, not just stereogenic centers. However, a significant difference is more likely due to a stereogenic change rather than just a subtle structural change. So, the presence of a new chiral center or a change in the configuration of an existing one would lead to a noticeable change in optical rotation.

Therefore, the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product, as this indicates a stereoselective substitution process that aligns with the proposed steps of the mechanism.
</think>

The difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product is the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism. This reaction involves the removal of the azido group from the β-carbon of alanine via β-elimination, forming an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate. The nucleophile then undergoes a stereoselective Michael addition at the β-carbon, potentially creating a new chiral center or altering the configuration of an existing one.

The observed difference in optical rotation suggests that the substitution process is stereoselective. If the substitution were non-stereoselective or if multiple stereoisomers were formed, the optical rotation might not show a significant change. However, the specific stereochemical outcome implied by the optical rotation difference aligns with the stereospecific nature of the Michael addition step in the proposed mechanism. Thus, the optical rotation data provides direct evidence for the stereoselective substitution process characteristic of the β-elimination–Michael addition pathway.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product would be the strongest evidence for a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction is. From what I remember, β-elimination typically involves the removal of a β-hydrogen, often forming a double bond. In the context of an amino acid like Ala(3-N3), which is 3-azido-L-alanine, the azide group is attached to the β-carbon. So, if a base removes a hydrogen from the β-carbon, it could cause an elimination reaction, maybe forming an imine or something similar.

Then, the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks a Michael acceptor, which is typically an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, if after the elimination, a double bond is formed, the next step would be the nucleophile adding to this double bond in a conjugate fashion.

Now, the dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Boc group is a protecting group for the amino terminus, Phe is phenylalanine, Ala(3-N3) is the modified alanine with the azide on the β-carbon, and OMe is a methyl ester protecting the carboxylic acid.

The nucleophile replaces the azido group by attacking the β-carbon, suggesting that the azide is leaving, possibly through a β-elimination mechanism. So, the process would involve two steps: first, elimination of the azide and a hydrogen to form a double bond, and then the nucleophile adds in a Michael addition to the β-carbon.

Now, why would the optical rotation differ between the starting material and the product? Optical rotation, or optical activity, is a property that indicates the presence of chiral centers. The starting dipeptide has L-alanine (Ala(3-N3)) as a chiral center. After the reaction, the product would have a different group at that β-carbon. If the reaction proceeds via β-elimination and Michael addition, the configuration at the β-carbon might change.

In the starting material, the azide group is on the β-carbon, which is a chiral center. After β-elimination, the double bond forms, and the stereochemistry might get inverted or changed. Then, during the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon, which could result in a different stereochemistry than the original.

Wait, but the Michael addition itself can have different stereochemical outcomes depending on the structure of the Michael acceptor and the nucleophile. If the addition is stereoselective, the configuration could change, leading to a different optical rotation.

Alternatively, if the reaction proceeds through a different mechanism, like a substitution, the stereochemistry might not change, or it might change depending on the substitution's stereochemistry.

So, if the starting dipeptide has a specific optical rotation due to the Ala(3-N3) being in a certain configuration, and the product has a different group (the nucleophile added) at the β-carbon, the optical rotation would change. This change would indicate that the configuration has altered, which could be due to the mechanism involving elimination and addition (β-elimination–Michael addition).

But wait, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl at the β-position. So, if the original configuration at the β-carbon was R, after elimination, the double bond is formed, and then the nucleophile adds either syn or anti to the existing groups. Depending on that, the stereochemistry can change.

If the Michael addition is not stereospecific or if the reaction creates a new stereocenter, the product's optical rotation would differ from the starting material, regardless of whether the mechanism is substitution, elimination, or Michael addition. So, just a change in optical rotation might not specifically point to the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that in a substitution reaction (like SN2), the stereochemistry at the β-carbon would invert. But in the β-elimination–Michael addition, the initial step removes a hydrogen and the leaving group (azide) via a planar transition state, leading to a double bond. Then, the Michael addition could create a new stereocenter with a specific configuration.

Wait, but if the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the product is also a single enantiomer but with a different configuration, the optical rotation would definitely change. However, in a substitution reaction, the stereochemistry might invert or retain based on the mechanism.

Alternatively, if the substitution were SN2, the stereochemistry would invert. If it's SN1, it might racemize. But in the case of a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the configuration at the β-carbon could be determined by the Michael addition step, potentially leading to a different stereochemistry than the original.

So, comparing the optical rotations would show if the configuration has changed. If the product has a different optical rotation, it suggests that the configuration has changed, which would support the idea that a β-elimination occurred, followed by a Michael addition that created a new stereocenter with a different configuration.

But why isn't a change in the NMR or another technique a better indicator? Well, optical rotation is a direct measure of chirality, so a noticeable difference would indicate a change in the molecule's stereochemistry. The magnitude of the difference would depend on how much the configuration has changed. If it's a small change, the rotation might not be very different, but a large change would result in a more pronounced difference.

In the case of a substitution reaction, the optical rotation might either stay the same (if the configuration is retained) or invert (if SN2), but in either case, it would likely be a smaller change because the substitution is at the same carbon. On the other hand, a β-elimination followed by Michael addition might create a new stereocenter or alter the existing one in a way that the optical rotation is more significantly affected.

Wait, but in the starting material, the β-carbon is a chiral center with the azide group. If the substitution occurs (like via an SN2), the configuration would invert, leading to a new configuration. The optical rotation would then reflect that inversion. If the Michael addition creates a new stereocenter, the product might have a different number of stereocenters or a different configuration.

Alternatively, suppose the Michael addition doesn't form a new stereocenter but adds in a way that changes the existing one. Then, the optical rotation would change accordingly.

I think the key point is that in a β-elimination–Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon is altered in a way that might not happen in a simple substitution. So, the change in optical rotation is evidence for this two-step mechanism because it indicates a change in stereochemistry that isn't just a simple substitution or elimination.

Another angle: in a substitution mechanism, the nucleophile replaces the leaving group without changing the stereochemistry (SN2) or possibly with some retention (SN1 with possible racemization). In the elimination followed by addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon could be determined anew during the Michael addition, leading to a different configuration than the original, which would cause a noticeable difference in optical rotation.

Additionally, the magnitude of the optical rotation difference would depend on how much the configuration changes. A large change would indicate a more significant structural alteration, which is consistent with a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, as opposed to a simple substitution or an SN1 process.

So, putting it all together, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and product would be strong evidence for a β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism because it shows a change in stereochemistry that suggests the involvement of these two steps. If the reaction were a simple substitution, the change in stereochemistry (if any) might be less pronounced or follow a different pattern, whereas the two-step mechanism could lead to a more significant and specific change in the optical rotation.
</think>

The difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product is the strongest evidence for a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction. Here's why:

1. **Mechanistic Steps and Stereochemistry**: 
   - In a β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism, the azide group is eliminated along with a β-hydrogen, forming a double bond. This step typically proceeds through a planar transition state, which can lead to the loss of stereochemistry at the β-carbon.
   - Subsequently, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound via a Michael addition. This step can create a new stereocenter or alter the existing one, depending on the structure of the Michael acceptor and the nucleophile.

2. **Impact on Optical Rotation**:
   - The starting dipeptide has a specific optical rotation due to the chiral center at the β-carbon of Ala(3-N3).
   - After the β-elimination and Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon is altered. This change in configuration results in a different optical rotation for the product.
   - The magnitude of this change depends on how significantly the stereochemistry is affected. A noticeable difference in optical rotation indicates a substantial change in the molecule's stereochemistry, which is consistent with the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.

3. **Comparison with Other Mechanisms**:
   - In a substitution reaction (e.g., SN2 or SN1), the stereochemistry at the β-carbon might invert (SN2) or racemize (SN1). However, the change in optical rotation from substitution is often less pronounced or follows a different pattern compared to the two-step mechanism.
   - The β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism can lead to a more significant and specific change in stereochemistry, resulting in a more pronounced difference in optical rotation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The observed difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product strongly suggests that the reaction proceeds via a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. This mechanism accounts for the change in stereochemistry and the resulting optical activity difference, which other mechanisms are less likely to explain adequately.

Thus, the change in optical rotation is compelling evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about the dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The scenario is that when treated with a nucleophilic base, the azido group gets replaced by the nucleophile at the β-carbon of the amino acid. The person thinks that a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction has happened. The question is asking for the strongest evidence supporting this mechanism, and the correct answer is the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product. Hmm, I need to understand why that is the case.

First, I need to recall what a β-elimination–Michael addition reaction entails. From what I remember, β-elimination typically involves the removal of a leaving group (like a leaving group substitution) with the formation of a double bond, creating an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Then, the Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks this α,β-unsaturated carbonyl at the β-carbon, which is a conjugate addition.

So, in the case of the dipeptide, the alanine residue has an azide group at the β-carbon. When treated with a strong base, the azide could act as a leaving group, leading to β-elimination. This would form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate, like an α,β-unsaturated amide or ester. Then, the nucleophile would perform a Michael addition, attacking the β-carbon.

Now, the question is about evidence for this mechanism. The suggested answer is the change in optical rotation. Optical rotation, or optical activity, is a property of chiral molecules. If the starting material and product have different optical rotations, it suggests a change in the molecule's chirality.

In the starting dipeptide, the alanine residue has an azido group. Azides can sometimes be good leaving groups, especially under basic conditions. When the azide leaves via β-elimination, it forms a double bond, making an α,β-unsaturated structure. If this intermediate is formed, then the Michael addition would add a nucleophile to the β-carbon, which would lead to a substitution product.

But wait, does the substitution at the β-carbon change the chirality of the molecule? Let's think about the structure. The alanine has a chiral center at the α-carbon. If the β-carbon is attacked, does that affect the α-carbon's configuration? Or is the substitution happening at the β-carbon without altering the α-carbon's configuration?

Wait, no, wait. In the starting material, the azide is on the β-carbon of alanine. If the β-carbon is getting replaced, that would be a substitution at the β-position. But the α-carbon is the chiral center. So, if during the reaction, the α-carbon's configuration remains unchanged, but the substituents on the β-carbon change, would that affect the overall optical rotation?

Wait, no, if the substitution is happening at the β-carbon, the α-carbon's configuration would remain the same, unless the elimination or addition process somehow affects it. But in a β-elimination, the α and β carbons are involved. Let me think again.

In β-elimination, the leaving group is on the β-carbon, and the adjacent α-carbon becomes part of a double bond. So, the structure becomes an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. Then, the Michael addition adds a nucleophile to the β-carbon, which would add across the double bond.

So, if the starting material is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe, when the azide leaves, it forms a double bond between the α and β carbons. Then, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, adding a substituent there.

If the substitution occurs at the β-carbon, would the configuration at the α-carbon change? Or would it remain the same? Because the α-carbon is a chiral center, and if the substituents change, its configuration might change.

Wait, but in the starting material, the Ala(3-N3) has an azide on the β-carbon. The alanine itself has a structure where the α-carbon is connected to a carboxyl group (from the peptide bond), a hydrogen, and two other groups: the amine and the β-carbon with the azide.

If the β-elimination occurs, the azide leaves, and the α and β carbons become double bonded. Now, the α-carbon is part of an sp² hybridized system. So, the configuration of the α-carbon would change from sp³ to sp², right? Because in elimination reactions, the orbitals change from sp³ to sp², which can lead to a change in stereochemistry.

So, during β-elimination, the α-carbon is deprotonated (maybe by the base), leading to the formation of a double bond. This process can lead to a possible racemization or change in configuration if the α-carbon's geometry changes.

Wait, but when you have an α-carbon in an amino acid, after elimination, it becomes part of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So, the α-carbon is now double bonded to the β-carbon. If the starting α-carbon was R configuration, after elimination, the geometry might change, leading to an S configuration, or maybe it becomes planar, leading to racemic mixtures.

But in reality, after elimination, the α-carbon is part of a conjugated system. The stereochemistry of the α-carbon could be influenced by the reaction conditions, like whether it's syn or anti elimination.

Wait, but in the case of a base-induced β-elimination, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond. The configuration of the α-carbon can change because it's moving from an sp³ to sp² hybridized state. This can cause the configuration to invert or not, depending on the mechanism.

But in the case of the dipeptide, the α-carbon is part of a peptide bond, meaning it's connected to the phenylalanine residue on one side and the rest of the molecule. So, would the deprotonation and elimination affect the stereochemistry of the α-carbon?

I think that after elimination, the α-carbon becomes trigonal planar (sp²), which would mean that its stereochemistry is lost. Then, during the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, and the protonation occurs, potentially leading to a new stereochemistry.

But wait, the Michael addition step is a conjugate addition. So, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, which is part of the double bond. The addition can be either syn or anti depending on the conditions.

So, if the Michael addition results in a new substituent on the β-carbon, that could create a new chiral center or alter the existing one.

Wait, but the original α-carbon was a chiral center. If the process involves changing its hybridization to sp², the configuration could change or be lost. Then, during the Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the β-carbon would be determined.

But in the product, the azide is replaced by the nucleophile at the β-carbon. If during the reaction, the α-carbon's configuration has changed, that would lead to a different optical rotation.

So, if the starting material has a certain specific rotation, and the product, after the reaction, has a different specific rotation, that suggests that the configuration has changed, which would be consistent with a β-elimination followed by Michael addition.

Alternatively, if the optical rotation remained the same, it might suggest that the configuration hasn't changed, implying a simple substitution without involving elimination and addition.

Therefore, the difference in optical rotation is a good indicator of whether the mechanism involved a change in configuration, which would occur if there was a β-elimination step that altered the stereochemistry at the α-carbon, followed by a Michael addition that possibly sets a new configuration at the β-carbon.

So, the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism would be the change in optical activity between the starting material and the product. This suggests that the stereochemistry at the α-carbon has been altered, which would not happen in a simple nucleophilic substitution without elimination and addition steps.

I think that makes sense. So, the optical rotation difference implies that there's a change in the molecule's stereochemistry, which points towards the proposed mechanism involving elimination and addition.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in the reaction of the dipeptide Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe with a nucleophilic base is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product. This change indicates a alteration in the molecule's stereochemistry, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism.

1. **Mechanism Overview**: The reaction involves β-elimination, where the azide group is removed, forming an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate. This step changes the hybridization of the α-carbon from sp³ to sp², potentially altering its stereochemistry. Subsequently, a Michael addition occurs, where the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, potentially introducing new stereochemistry.

2. **Impact on Optical Rotation**: The starting material has a specific optical rotation due to its chiral α-carbon. If the α-carbon's stereochemistry is altered during β-elimination (e.g., inversion or racemization), the product will have a different optical rotation. This change in optical activity serves as evidence for the mechanism, as a simple substitution would not typically cause such a stereochemical change.

3. **Conclusion**: The difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product strongly supports the occurrence of β-elimination followed by Michael addition, as this mechanism accounts for the observed stereochemical change.

**Answer**: The difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism, as it indicates a change in stereochemistry that aligns with the proposed reaction pathway.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about a peptide reaction mechanism. The dipeptide given is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. From what I understand, Boc is tert-butoxycarbonyl, which is a common protecting group for amino groups. Phe is phenylalanine, and Ala(3-N3) is alanine where the amino group has been substituted with an azide group. The OMe is a methyl ester, probably protecting the carboxylic acid.

The scenario is that this dipeptide is treated with a nucleophilic base. They observe that the azido group gets replaced by the nucleophile, specifically forming a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. So, the azide is on the β-carbon, which in alanine is the same carbon as the amino group. Wait, no, in alanine, the amino group is on the α-carbon. So, if it's Ala(3-N3), that means the azide is on the β-carbon? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Ala has the structure: NH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the α-carbon is the one attached to the amino group, the β-carbon is the methyl group, and the γ-carbon is the carboxylic acid. If it's Ala(3-N3), then the azide is on the γ-carbon? That doesn't make sense because the γ-carbon is the carboxylic acid. Maybe it's a typo or I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe it's Ala(3-N3) meaning that the azide is on the β-carbon. So, Ala(3-N3) would have the azide on the β-carbon, which is the methyl group. So, the structure would be CH2-N3 instead of CH3.

Now, the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon, replacing the azide. The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. So, first, β-elimination would remove the azide and create a double bond, perhaps forming an imine or something. Then, a Michael addition would occur where the nucleophile attacks the α,β-unsaturated system.

The question is asking for the strongest evidence for this β-elimination-Michael addition mechanism. The given reasoning is that there's a difference in the magnitude of optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. I need to understand why that is the case.

Optical rotation, or optical activity, is a property that indicates the presence of chiral centers in a molecule. If a reaction proceeds through a mechanism that involves the formation and/or breakdown of chiral centers, it can affect the optical rotation. In this case, if the reaction involves a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition, the stereochemistry of the product might be different from the starting material.

Let me walk through the mechanism. Starting with Ala(3-N3), which has the azide on the β-carbon. When treated with a nucleophile, the azide is replaced by the nucleophile. If the mechanism is β-elimination first, that would involve the removal of the azide group along with a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, maybe an elimination reaction where the azide and a hydrogen are removed, forming a double bond, creating a conjugated system.

Then, the Michael addition would occur. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the conjugated enone (or enamine, depending on the structure). Michael addition is a conjugate addition, meaning the nucleophile adds to the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This addition typically occurs with good stereochemical control, especially under kinetic conditions, where the nucleophile attacks from the less substituted side, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

In the starting material, the alanine residue has its amino group (or azide) on the α-carbon. If the azide is replaced by a nucleophile via a Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the α-carbon would be influenced by the mechanism. If the reaction goes through a planar intermediate, like a carbonyl, it could lead to racemization. However, if it goes through a stereospecific pathway, the stereochemistry might be preserved or altered in a specific way.

But wait, if a β-elimination occurs first, that would form a double bond. In that process, the stereochemistry at the α-carbon might change because the formation of the double bond could involve deprotonation and possibly some reorganization. Then, the Michael addition would add a nucleophile across the double bond, creating a new stereocenter.

So, if the process involves both elimination and addition steps, the stereochemistry could either form a new stereocenter or change an existing one. The resulting product would have a different configuration at that carbon, leading to a change in the optical rotation.

The starting material is a dipeptide, which is chiral because Phe and Ala are both chiral amino acids, and the dipeptide would have a specific configuration. The product, after reaction, would have the azide replaced by the nucleophile. If the mechanism involves a change in the configuration, then the product would have a different optical rotation.

But why is the difference in optical rotation considered the strongest evidence? It must be because it directly relates to the formation of a new stereocenter or the loss of an existing one. If the reaction proceeds through a mechanism that forms a new stereocenter, the product will exhibit a different optical rotation. If the mechanism does not involve any change in stereochemistry, the rotation would remain the same.

In the case of a β-elimination-Michael addition, the Michael addition step could form a new stereocenter. Alternatively, if the elimination step leads to the loss of a chiral center, the addition step could create a new one. Either way, the optical rotation would change because the configuration at that carbon is altered.

So, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product indicates that a stereogenic center has been changed or created, which is a hallmark of a process involving elimination and addition steps. If the mechanism were different, say a simple substitution without any stereochemical change, the optical rotation wouldn't change much. Therefore, the change in rotation supports the proposed mechanism.

I'm also thinking about other possible mechanisms. For example, if it's a direct nucleophilic substitution without elimination, the nucleophile would attack the β-carbon directly, but that might not necessarily change the stereochemistry because the β-carbon might not be a stereocenter. Wait, in Ala(3-N3), the azide is on the β-carbon, which is a methyl group. So, replacing it with a nucleophile might not necessarily create a new stereocenter unless the attack happens with specific stereochemistry.

But in the proposed mechanism, the nucleophile attacks after elimination, leading to a conjugated system where the addition can have stereochemical control. So, the Michael addition step would lead to the formation of a new stereocenter, which was not present before. That would definitely change the optical rotation.

Therefore, the key evidence is the change in optical activity, which points to a change in the stereochemistry of the molecule. Without such a change, we wouldn't see a significant difference in rotation, supporting the mechanism where stereochemistry is altered through elimination and addition.
</think>

The strongest evidence for the proposed β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in the reaction of Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe with a nucleophilic base is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Mechanism Overview**: The reaction involves two key steps—β-elimination and Michael addition. β-elimination removes the azido group and a proton, forming a conjugated system (likely an enone). This is followed by a Michael addition, where the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the conjugated system, potentially forming a new stereocenter.

2. **Stereochemical Implications**: 
   - ** Elimination Step**: The β-elimination step may lead to the loss of a chiral center or alter the configuration at the α-carbon.
   - ** Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic attack in the Michael addition step creates a new stereocenter, introducing chirality where there was none or altering existing stereochemistry.

3. **Optical Rotation**: The optical rotation of a molecule is directly influenced by the presence and configuration of stereocenters. If the reaction mechanism involves the formation or alteration of a stereocenter, the optical rotation will change. A significant difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product indicates that a stereogenic center has been created or modified.

4. **Conclusion**: The change in optical rotation provides direct evidence of a stereoselective process, such as the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism, where stereochemistry is altered through elimination and addition steps. This is stronger evidence than, say, substitution reactions that do not necessarily involve stereochemical change.

Thus, the difference in optical rotation strongly supports the proposed mechanism.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product is the strongest evidence for a β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism. Let me break this down step by step.

First, what do I know about β-elimination and Michael addition? I remember that β-elimination is a reaction where a bond is broken, specifically a β-hydrogen and a bond adjacent to it, leading to the formation of a double bond. This usually happens under basic conditions, right? So in this case, the azido group on the Ala(3-N3) residue acts as a leaving group because azide is a good leaving group. The base would deprotonate the β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of the azide group and forming a double bond between the α and β carbons of the alanine. So now we have an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like a conjugated enone.

Next, the Michael addition comes into play. The nucleophile (the base used in the reaction, maybe hydroxide or something else) would attack the β-carbon of this conjugated enone. Wait, but the question says the nucleophile forms a bond with the β-carbon of the amino acid. Hmm. So in a typical Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta position of the enone, which would be the same as what's happening here.

Now, what happens to the stereochemistry in this process? Let's think. The β-elimination step creates a double bond, which introduces geometric isomerism. Then, the Michael addition could proceed with either retention or inversion of configuration, depending on the mechanism. If the addition is conjugate (like in a Michael addition), the nucleophile can add from either the same face or the opposite face of the double bond, leading to different stereochemical outcomes.

But wait, optical rotation is all about the overall configuration of the molecule. If the starting material has a certain configuration (say, the alanine is L-alanine), and after the reactions, the configuration at the β-carbon changes, that would affect the optical rotation. But the starting dipeptide is Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. The Ala(3-N3) group is a modified alanine where the side chain is an azide. After reaction, the azide is replaced by the nucleophile at the β-carbon, which is the same carbon as the side chain in alanine.

So, in the starting material, the configuration at the β-carbon (the carbon where the side chain is attached) is R, if it's L-alanine. After the reaction, the nucleophile adds to this carbon. If the addition is stereoselective, the configuration might change. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects optical rotation.

Wait, optical rotation measures the extent to which the plane polarization of light is rotated as it passes through the chiral medium. Each chiral center contributes to the overall rotation. If the configuration at the β-carbon changes, the rotation might either increase, decrease, or even change sign depending on the original and new configurations.

If the mechanism involves a Michael addition, which is typically suprafacial, the nucleophile adds to the same face as the leaving group. But I'm not sure how that affects the configuration. Alternatively, the elimination step could lead to some racemization because the double bond formation would break some of the stereochemical information.

Another thought: if the starting material has a specific optical rotation, and the product has a different rotation, it suggests that the configuration has changed. But is that enough to conclude it's a β-elimination–Michael addition? Because other mechanisms could also lead to a change in the configuration or the addition of a nucleophile at that position.

Wait, the key here is that the nucleophile is attacking the β-carbon, which is not the usual site for substitution. In a normal SN2 reaction, the nucleophile would attack the α-carbon, but here it's the β. So that suggests a different mechanism, like a conjugate addition, which is what the Michael addition is.

Moreover, the β-elimination would form an activated double bond, making the β-carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. So the two steps—elimination to form the enone and then Michael addition—would be part of the same mechanism.

Now, how does the optical rotation come into play as evidence? If the reaction goes through a planar transition state during elimination or perhaps some other step that could lead to racemization, the optical rotation might change. Alternatively, if the Michael addition has specific stereochemical outcomes, the rotation would indicate whether the configuration is the same or different.

But the question says the strongest evidence is the difference in optical rotation. So why is that?

I think it's because if the mechanism involved a simple substitution without elimination, the nucleophile would attack the α-carbon directly, leading to a different product. But since it's attacking the β-carbon, that suggests a conjugated addition, which requires the formation of an enone (the β-elimination step). So the fact that the nucleophile is adding to the β-carbon indicates that an elimination occurred first, making the β-carbon more accessible for the Michael addition.

But how does that relate to the optical rotation? The optical rotation measures the overall configuration. If the substitution happened at the β-carbon via Michael addition, the configuration at that carbon would change in a way that depends on the mechanism. If the Michael addition was stereoselective, the rotation would change accordingly. Alternatively, if the elimination step led to some loss of stereochemistry, the rotation would reflect that.

Wait, but the strongest evidence would be that the reaction pathway involves both elimination and addition steps, which together lead to a specific stereochemical outcome that is different from a direct substitution. The change in optical rotation confirms that the configuration has changed, which couldn't happen in a simple substitution. So the difference in rotation shows that the mechanism isn't a straightforward substitution but involves the two-step process.

Another angle: In a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, the stereochemistry at the α-carbon (which is part of the dipeptide) remains intact because only the β-carbon is involved. But the optical rotation would still reflect any changes at the β-carbon, which is part of the alanine residue. So if the starting material is, say, a specific enantiomer, and the product has a different configuration at the β-carbon, the overall rotation would differ.

Moreover, if the Michael addition is not stereoselective, you might get a racemic mixture, leading to a different optical rotation. Alternatively, if the addition is stereoselective, you might get a specific enantiomer, changing the rotation in a particular direction.

So, the key point is that the optical rotation difference indicates that the configuration at the β-carbon has changed, which is consistent with a Michael addition (conjugate addition) mechanism. This couldn't happen in a typical substitution or elimination without the addition step.

Therefore, the difference in optical rotation is the strongest evidence because it shows that the nucleophile isn't just replacing the azide directly but rather through a conjugate addition mechanism that involves elimination and addition steps.

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Mechanism Overview**: The reaction involves two steps—β-elimination followed by Michael addition. The β-elimination step removes the azido group, forming an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (enone). This enone is then attacked by the nucleophile at the β-carbon in a Michael addition.

2. **Impact on Optical Rotation**: Optical rotation is sensitive to the stereochemistry of a molecule. The starting material has a specific configuration, typically L-alanine, which gives it a characteristic optical rotation. The product, after the nucleophile replaces the azide, may have a different configuration at the β-carbon. This change in configuration alters the overall optical rotation of the molecule.

3. ** Evidence for Mechanism**: 
   - The nucleophile attacking the β-carbon instead of the α-carbon suggests a conjugate addition mechanism, which is characteristic of the Michael addition.
   - The elimination step (β-elimination) creates the necessary enone intermediate for the Michael addition to occur. Without this elimination, a simple substitution would likely occur at the α-carbon.
   - The difference in optical rotation confirms that the configuration has changed, which aligns with the stereochemical outcomes expected from the Michael addition.

4. **Conclusion**: The change in optical rotation is strong evidence because it demonstrates that the reaction pathway involves a two-step process (elimination and addition) rather than a direct substitution. This mechanism is consistent with the observed stereochemical changes and the specific site of nucleophilic attack.

Thus, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.
[overthinking]
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the change in optical rotation is the strongest evidence for a β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in this peptide chemistry reaction. Let me start by breaking down what's happening here.

We have a dipeptide: Boc-Phe-Ala(3-N3)-OMe. So, Boc is tert-butoxycarbonyl, Phe is phenylalanine, Ala(3-N3) is alanine with an azido group at the β-carbon, and OMe is a methyl ester. The reaction involves treating this with a nucleophilic base, and the azido group is getting replaced by the nucleophile at the β-carbon of the alanine.

The proposed mechanism is a β-elimination followed by a Michael addition. Let me recall: β-elimination usually forms a double bond, removing a leaving group (like azide here), and then a Michael addition would involve a nucleophile attacking a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the azide is first removed, forming an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, and then the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon.

Optical rotation, or optical activity, is related to the chirality of a molecule. If the configuration of the stereocenter changes during the reaction, the optical rotation would change. In the starting dipeptide, the alanine residue has an azido group at the β-carbon, which is a chiral center. After the reaction, this azido group is replaced, so the configuration at that β-carbon might change.

Wait, but in a substitution reaction, depending on the mechanism, the stereochemistry could be retained or inverted. For SN2, you get inversion; for SN1, you can have some racemization. But in this case, it's a β-elimination followed by Michael addition, which is a two-step process.

In the β-elimination step, the azide is removed, forming a double bond. The mechanism of elimination could lead to some change in the structure. Then, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon. The Michael addition is a conjugate addition, so the nucleophile attacks the β-position, which could result in either retention or inversion of configuration depending on the transition state.

Wait, but if the elimination step removes the stereogenic center (the β-azido group), then the Michael addition creates a new stereogenic center. So if the mechanism involves a planar transition state during the elimination, perhaps leading to some loss of stereochemistry, but then the addition could create a new stereochemistry.

However, the starting material has a specific configuration at the β-carbon, and the product would have a new configuration. If the mechanism goes through a process where the configuration is not retained, that would change the optical rotation.

In the starting dipeptide, the alanine has the azido group in a specific configuration, say R or S. After the substitution, the nucleophile replaces it, so the configuration might be R or S as well. But if the mechanism causes an inversion or a change, the optical rotation would differ.

Wait, but if it's a substitution via SN2, you'd get inversion. However, in this case, it's not a simple substitution—it's a two-step process. So, the elimination would form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, which is flat, and then the nucleophile adds. The Michael addition is stereoselective, but depending on the reaction conditions, it could lead to either retention or a different configuration.

If the starting material has a certain optical rotation, and the product has a different one, that suggests that the configuration has changed. So, a difference in optical rotation would indicate a change in the stereochemistry, which would support the mechanism involving a Michael addition that creates a new stereocenter with a different configuration than the original.

But why is this the strongest evidence? Because other mechanisms might not necessarily change the stereochemistry. For example, a simple SN2 substitution would invert the configuration, but it's a one-step process. However, in this case, since it's a two-step mechanism, the stereochemistry could be altered differently.

Moreover, the Michael addition is known to create new stereocenters with specific stereochemical outcomes based on the reaction conditions. So, the fact that the optical rotation has changed suggests that the configuration has changed, which aligns with a Michael addition step where a new configuration is formed, different from the starting material.

Alternatively, if the mechanism were a simple substitution without the elimination-addition steps, we might expect a different change in optical rotation, possibly just inversion (like in SN2) or some racemization (in SN1). But the specific two-step process—elimination followed by addition—would lead to a different stereochemical outcome.

Therefore, the difference in optical rotation between the starting material and the product is the strongest evidence because it shows a change in the stereochemistry at the β-carbon, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism involving a Michael addition that creates a new stereocenter with different configuration than the original.

The strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism in the given reaction is the observed difference in optical rotation between the starting dipeptide and the product. This change in optical rotation indicates a change in the stereochemistry at the β-carbon, which aligns with the proposed mechanism. 

In the β-elimination step, the azido group is removed, forming an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This elimination step likely removes the original stereogenic center at the β-carbon. The subsequent Michael addition step introduces a new stereogenic center at the β-carbon, where the nucleophile attacks. The optical rotation change reflects the creation of a new stereocenter with a different configuration than the original, supporting the formation of a new chiral center through the Michael addition. 

This two-step mechanism, involving elimination and addition, leads to a stereochemical outcome distinct from a simple substitution reaction, thereby providing clear evidence of the proposed pathway. The difference in optical rotation is a direct consequence of the altered stereochemistry, making it the strongest evidence for the β-elimination–Michael addition mechanism.
