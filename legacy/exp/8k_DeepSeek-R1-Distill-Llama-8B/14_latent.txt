Okay, so Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu. He needs to figure out how much butter he needs to make these croissants. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Alright, so 1 dozen is 12 croissants, right? So, 1/4 pound makes 12 croissants. That means each croissant uses 1/12 pound of butter. Let me write that down:

Butter per croissant = 1/4 pound / 12 croissants = 1/48 pound per croissant.

Okay, so each croissant needs 1/48 pound of butter. That seems correct because 1/48 multiplied by 48 would give us 1/4 pound for 12 croissants, which matches the problem statement.

Now, Juan wants to start with making 4 dozen croissants a day. Let me convert that into the number of croissants. 4 dozen is 4 times 12, which is:

4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 croissants.

So, he needs to make 48 croissants each day. Wait, but the question says he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week. I need to check if that's 4 dozen per day or 4 dozen per week.

Looking back: "He wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week." So, yes, it's 4 dozen each day for a week. So, that would be 4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen in total.

Wait, but let me double-check. If he wants to make 4 dozen a day, that's 4 * 12 = 48 croissants every day. So, for a week, which is 7 days, he would need 48 * 7 croissants. Let me compute that:

48 croissants/day * 7 days = 336 croissants in total.

Then, but let me double-check. If he wants to make 4 dozen a day, that's 4 * 12 = 48 croissants every day. So, for a week, which is 7 days, he would need 48 * 7 croissants. Let me write down the calculations step by step:

48 croissants/day * 7 days = 336 croissants in total.

Ah, but let me double-check. If he wants to make 4 dozen a day, that's 4 * 12 = 48 croissants every day. So, for a week, which is 7 days, he would need 48 * 7 croissants. Let me compute that:

48 croissants/day * 7 days = 336 croissants in total.
