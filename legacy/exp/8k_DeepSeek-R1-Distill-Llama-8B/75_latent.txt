Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about when bootstrapping is preferred over pure simulation. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what bootstrapping and pure simulation are. From what I remember, bootstrapping is a resampling method where you create new datasets by drawing samples with replacement from the original dataset. This is often used to estimate things like confidence intervals and standard errors when the true distribution is unknown. On the other hand, pure simulation seems to be about generating data based on a known distribution, maybe using something like a random number generator with a specified probability density function.

Now, the question is asking under which situations bootstrapping would be preferred over pure simulation. The options given are four different scenarios (i to iv), and the correct answer is said to be option C: (i), (ii), and (iv) only. But I need to figure out why.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option (i): If it's desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are the same as those of some actual data.

Hmm. So, in this case, we want our simulated data to have similar distributional properties to real data. I think bootstrapping achieves this because it resamples the original data, so the distribution of the bootstrapped data will be identical to the original. Pure simulation, on the other hand, uses a known distribution, which might not match the real data distribution. So, for example, if real data comes from a normal distribution but we simulate using uniform, they won't match. So, if we need the same distribution, bootstrapping is better. So, (i) is a situation where bootstrapping is preferred.

Option (ii): If it is desired that the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are known exactly.

Hmm. So here, the distribution is known exactly. In that case, pure simulation might be better because you can directly use the known distribution to generate data. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, is used when the distribution is unknown. So, if we know the exact distribution, there's no need for resampling. So, pure simulation would be preferred here. Therefore, (ii) is a situation where pure simulation is preferred, not bootstrapping. So, the statement in the question says "would bootstrapping be preferred," so (ii) is not a case where bootstrapping is preferred. That's interesting because I initially thought maybe (ii) was a point for bootstrapping, but no, it's the opposite.

Alright. So here, the distribution is known exactly. In that case, pure simulation might be better because you can directly use the known distribution to generate data. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, is used when the distribution is unknown. So, if we know the exact distribution, there's no need for resampling. So, pure simulation would be preferred here. Therefore, (ii) is a situation where pure simulation is preferred, not bootstrapping. So, the statement in the question says "would bootstrapping be preferred," so (ii) is not a case where bootstrapping is preferred. That's interesting because I initially thought maybe (ii) was a point for bootstrapping, but no, it's the opposite.
