<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>There is a multiple-choice question: Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?. The options are: A. 500 Hz, B. 1,750 Hz, C. 2,750 Hz, D. 3,500 Hz.

Okay, so I have this question about sound diffraction from a slit. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with a long rectangular slit that's 0.14 m across. We need to find the frequency at which the sound first disappears at a 45-degree angle from the normal to the speaker face. The options are 500 Hz, 1,750 Hz, 2,750 Hz, and 3,500 Hz, and the correct answer is supposed to be B, 1,750 Hz. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that when sound waves pass through a slit, they diffract according to the single-slit diffraction pattern. The formula for the diffraction angle is given by the far-field approximation, which is:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac \lambda \left(1 - \cos \alpha \right)
$$

Wait, actually, isn't that the equation for single-slit diffraction? Or is it the double-slit? No, for single-slit, it's a bit different. Let me recall. The condition for constructive interference in single-slit diffraction is:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac \lambda \left(1 - \cos \alpha \right)
$$

But actually, I think it's more precise to say that the minima occur when:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac \lambda \left(1 - \cos \alpha \right)
$$

However actually, I think it's more precise to say that the minima occur when:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac \lambda \left(1 - \cos \alpha \right)
$$

So actually, I think it's more precise to say that the minima occur when:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac \lambda \left(1 - \cos \alpha \right)
$$
