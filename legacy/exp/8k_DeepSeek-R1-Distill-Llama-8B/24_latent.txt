Alright, so I've got this programming problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum number of time units required to execute a set of assignment statements. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We have six assignment statements:

A := B + C  
B := A - B  
C := A * E  
D := A / F  
E := B - C  
F := A + B  

These statements need to be executed in such a way that the final result is the same as if we executed them in the given order. The question is asking, if we have as many identical processors as needed, what's the minimum number of time units needed to execute all these assignments.

The options are: A.1, B.2, C.3, D.4. And it's suggested that the correct answer is B.2. Hmm, okay.

I think the key here is to figure out the dependencies between these assignments. Since all assignments can be executed in parallel, but each assignment takes one time unit. So, if we can find an order where assignments can be executed in parallel without conflicting, the total time would be the number of such parallelizable steps.

But wait, each assignment is a statement that can be executed in unit time, and if we have enough processors, we can execute as many statements as we have in each time unit. So the question is about how many separate, non-dependent assignments can be done in each time unit. So, the minimum number of time units required would be the maximum number of dependent assignments that are sequential, right?

But perhaps I should think of this as a dependency graph where each assignment depends on certain variables, and the dependencies determine the order in which they can be executed. Since it's stated that we can execute as many as needed, but the goal is to minimize the time.

Second perhaps I should think of this as a dependency graph where each assignment depends on certain variables, and the dependencies determine the order in which they can be executed. Since it's stated that we can execute as many as needed, but the goal is to minimize the time.
