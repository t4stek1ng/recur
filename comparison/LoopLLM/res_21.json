The term \"pulling objects together\" implies that the force of gravity is acting in a direction that brings objects closer to each other.\n\nTo define gravity mathematically, we can use the following formula:\n\nF = G \\* (m1 \\* m2) / r^2\n\nWhere:\n\n* F is the force of gravity between two objects\n* G is the gravitational constant (6.67408e-11 N m^2 kg^-2)\n* m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects\n* r is the distance between the centers of the two objects\n\nInverse means the opposite of direct, so in this case, it means that the force of gravity is acting in the opposite direction of the distance between the objects.\n\nTherefore, the definition of gravity is:\n\nGravity is the force that acts between two objects, pulling them towards each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",
