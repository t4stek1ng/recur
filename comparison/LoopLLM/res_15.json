Here is the edited article with any spelling or grammar errors corrected:\n\n\"This article explains how blockchain works.\"\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. It's the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it has a much broader range of applications beyond digital currency.\n\nHere's how blockchain works:\n\n1. Decentralized network: Blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that work together to validate and record transactions. There is no central authority controlling the network, and all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that is accessible to everyone.\n2. Distributed ledger: The blockchain is a distributed ledger, meaning that it's not stored on a single computer or server. Instead, it's replicated across a network of computers, making it more secure and resilient to tampering.\n3. Consensus mechanism: The network of computers on the blockchain uses a consensus mechanism to validate transactions. This means that a majority of the network must agree that a transaction is valid before it's added to the blockchain.\n4. Cryptographic techniques: Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect the integrity of the network. This includes the use of digital signatures and encryption to ensure that only authorized parties can access the network.\n5. Smart contracts: Blockchain can also be used to create smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. These contracts can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, from supply chain management to insurance claims.\n6. Blocks: Transactions are grouped together into blocks, which are then added to the blockchain. Each block contains a unique code that connects it to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks that makes it difficult to alter transactions once they've been recorded.\n7. Mining: The process of adding new blocks to the blockchain is called mining. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, which helps to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nOverall, blockchain is a powerful technology that has the potential to transform a wide range of industries. Its decentralized, secure, and transparent nature makes it an attractive option for businesses and individuals alike.",
