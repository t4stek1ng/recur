For example, the House of Commons in the UK has 650 members, while the House of Lords has around 800 members.\n2. Regional Parliaments:\n\t* In regional parliamentary systems, the number of members can range from 50 to 200. Examples include the European Parliament (751 members) and the African Union Parliament (265 members).\n3. Local Parliaments:\n\t* In local parliamentary systems, the number of members can range from 10 to 50.
