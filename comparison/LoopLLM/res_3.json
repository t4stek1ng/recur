        "answer": "Sure! Here's a cultural proverb that reflects the idea of \"one small decision can change your life\":\n\n\"The ripple of a single stone can create a tsunami in the pond of life.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that even the smallest decision or action can have a significant impact on one's life, much like a small stone thrown into a pond can create ripples that grow and spread far and wide. It implies that the choices we make every day, no matter how small they may seem, can have a profound effect on our future and the lives of those around us.\n\nThis proverb could be used in a variety of contexts, such as when encouraging someone to take a leap of faith or to be mindful of the choices they make. For example, if someone is feeling stuck in their life, they might be told, \"Remember, the ripple of a single stone can create a tsunami in the pond of life. One small decision can change everything.\"",
