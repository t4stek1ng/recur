Finally, the program adds up the total cost of all ingredients to get the total cost of the meal.\n\nTo use this program, you would need to replace the placeholders `Lettuce`, `Tomatoes`, `Onion`, and `Garlic` with the actual names of the ingredients in your meal. You would also need to update the costs in the `costs` dictionary to match the cost of each ingredient in your meal.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to calculate the cost of a meal that includes 3 ounces of lettuce, 2 tomatoes, 1 onion, and 2 cloves of garlic, you could use the following code:\n```\ningredients = {\n    \"Lettuce\": 3,\n    \"Tomatoes\": 2,\n    \"Onion\": 1,\n    \"Garlic\": 2\n}\n\ncosts = {\n    \"Lettuce\": 1.50,\n    \"Tomatoes\": 0.50,\n    \"Onion\": 0.20,\n    \"Garlic\": 0.05\n}\n\ntotal_cost = 0\nfor ingredient in ingredients:\n    total_cost += costs[ingredient] * ingredients[ingredient]\nprint(\"Total cost: $\", total_cost)\n```\nThis would output the total cost of the meal, which in this case would be $3.75 (3 ounces of lettuce x $1.50 per ounce + 2 tomatoes x $0.50 per tomato + 1 onion x $0.20 per onion + 2 cloves of garlic x $0.05 per clove).",

We then define a function `get_price` that takes an ingredient as input and returns its cost. The function uses a series of `if` statements to check the ingredient and return its corresponding cost. If the ingredient is not found in the dictionary, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nIn the main program, we iterate over the ingredients in the dictionary and multiply each quantity by its cost. We then add up all the costs to get the total cost of the meal. Finally, we print the total cost.\n\nNote that in the `get_price` function, we are using the `if` statement to check the ingredient and return its cost. This is a simple way to handle the cost of each ingredient, but you may want to consider using a more complex pricing system depending on the specific requirements of your program.",

Just add new lines to the program to define the new ingredients and their costs, and the program will automatically calculate the total cost of the meal.\n\nFor example, you can add the cost of a protein source like chicken or beef by adding a new variable and assigning its cost:\n```\n# Ingredients and their costs\nlettuce = 3  # oz\ntomatoes = 2  # pcs\nonion = 1  # pc\ngarlic = 2  # cloves\nchicken = 1  # lb\nchicken_cost = $5.00\n\n# Total cost of the meal\ntotal_cost = lettuce_cost + tomatoes_cost + onion_cost + garlic_cost + chicken_cost\n\nprint(\"Total cost of the meal: $\", total_cost)\n```\nThis program defines a new ingredient `chicken` and its cost `chicken_cost`, and then calculates the total cost of the meal by adding up the costs of all the ingredients.\n\nI hope this helps!
